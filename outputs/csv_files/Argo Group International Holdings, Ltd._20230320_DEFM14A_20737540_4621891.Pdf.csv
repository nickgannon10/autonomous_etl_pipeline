Time, Place and Purpose of the Special General Meeting (Page 90)
The special general meeting (which we refer to as the “special general meeting”) will be held on April 19,
2023, starting at 9:00 a.m. local Bermuda time (8:00 a.m. Eastern Time) at Wellesley House South, W Room (2

will be asked to consider and vote on each of the following proposals:
Proposal l (the “merger proposal”): to approve the merger agreement, the statutory merger agreement
and the merger;
Proposal 2 (the “compensation advisory proposal”): on an advisory (non-binding) basis, to approve
the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Argo Group’s named executive officers that
is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as described in this proxy statement; and
Proposal 3 (the “adjournment proposal”): to approve an adjournment of the special general meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes to
approve the merger proposal at the special general meeting.
Holders of common shares issued and outstanding as of the record date (as defined below) will be
entitled to vote on each of the above proposals, whereas holders of preferred shares issued and outstanding
as of the record date will be entitled to vote only on Proposal 1 and Proposal 3.
Consummation of the merger is conditioned on, among other things, the approval of Proposal 1 above,
but is not conditioned on the approval of Proposals 2 or 3.
Record Date (Page 90)
Only shareholders of record, as shown on Argo Group’s register of members, at the close of business
on March 16, 2023, the record date for the special general meeting (which we refer to as the “record date”),
will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special general meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof. As of March 16, 2023, the record date for the special general meeting, there were 35,097,821 common
shares issued and outstanding and 6,000 preferred shares issued and outstanding.

ndTABLE OF CONTENTS
Each common share and each preferred share carries the right to vote on the merger proposal and the
adjournment proposal. Accordingly, the quorum required at the special general meeting to consider the
merger proposal and the adjournment proposal is the presence in person or represented by proxy of
shareholders representing in excess of 50% of the total voting power of all outstanding common shares and
preferred shares, voting as one class, as of the record date. Only common shares carry the right to vote on
the compensation advisory proposal. Accordingly, the quorum required at the special general meeting to
consider the compensation advisory proposal is the presence in person or represented by proxy of
shareholders representing in excess of 50% of the total voting power of all outstanding common shares as of
the record date.
Required Vote (Page 91)
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding common shares and preferred shares, voting as one class, that are entitled to vote at the
special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws.
The approval of the compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast by holders of common shares that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote at the special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws.
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting
power of holders of common shares and preferred shares, voting as one class, that are present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s
Bye-Laws.
Voting Securities (Page 91)
Except as provided below, (i) holders of common shares have one vote for each common share held by
them as of the record date and are entitled to vote all common shares held by them as of the record date on
all the proposals voted on at the special general meeting or any adjournment thereof and (ii) holders of
preferred shares have one vote for each preferred share held by them as of the record date and are entitled to
vote all preferred shares held by them as of the record date only on the merger proposal and on the
adjournment proposal. See the section of this proxy statement titled “The Special General Meeting - Voting
Securities” for a description of the voting rights of the preferred shares. Holders of depositary shares must
act through the depositary to exercise any voting rights in respect of the preferred shares (or fractions
thereof) represented thereby and the depositary will vote preferred shares held by it in accordance with the
terms of its depositary agreement.
Under Argo Group’s Bye-Laws, no “U.S. Person”  (as that term is defined in Argo Group’s Bye-Laws)
that owns Argo Group shares directly, or indirectly through foreign entities, is entitled to exercise voting
power on a matter (either directly or through a person whose ownership of shares in us is attributed to such
U.S. Person) to the extent such voting power equals or exceeds 9.5% of the votes conferred on all of Argo
Group shares entitled to vote on such matter, after taking into consideration all votes held by such U.S.
Person directly or through attribution. Pursuant to Argo Group’s Bye-Laws, if there is any U.S. Person which
had voting power which equaled or exceeded 9.5% of such shares and so could be considered a “9.5% U.S.
Member”  (as that term is defined in Argo Group’s Bye-Laws) as of the record date, the voting power of all
shares will be adjusted (and will be automatically adjusted in the future) to the extent necessary so that there
will be no such 9.5% U.S. Member.
If your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct
your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee.
If you fail to submit a proxy or to attend and vote in person at the special general meeting and you are a
record holder, your shares will not be counted for purposes of quorum or as votes cast at the special general
meeting. If your shares are held in “street name” and you do not provide your bank, broker or other nominee
with voting instructions, your shares will not be voted. If you choose to vote in person at the special general

Abstentions will be counted toward the presence of a quorum at the special general meeting. Because
all proposals presented to shareholders will be considered non-discretionary, your broker, bank or other
nominee will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on any of the proposals without your
instructions and accordingly, there will not be any broker non-votes at the special general meeting. Broker
non-votes (if any) will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not
count as votes cast at the special general meeting.
Because approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power
of the outstanding common shares and preferred shares, voting as one class, that are entitled to vote at the
special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws (assuming a quorum is present), an
abstention will have the effect of a vote against the merger proposal.
Because approval of the compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast by holders of common shares that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled
to vote at the special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws (assuming a quorum is
present), an abstention with respect to the compensation advisory proposal will not have the effect of a vote
for or against the compensation advisory proposal, but will reduce the number of votes cast and therefore
increase the relative influence of those shareholders voting.
Because approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting
power of the outstanding common shares and preferred shares, voting as one class, that are present in
person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special general meeting in accordance with Argo
Group’s Bye-Laws, an abstention with respect to the adjournment proposal will have the effect of a vote
against the adjournment proposal, but common shares or preferred shares deemed not in attendance at the
special general meeting, whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to
provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee, will have no effect on the
outcome of the adjournment proposal.
Revocation of Proxies (Page 92)
Holders of record may revoke a submitted proxy prior to its exercise at the special general meeting, or
any adjournment thereof, in any of the following ways: (1) submitting a later dated vote by telephone or
through the Internet in a timely manner (and in any event no later than 48 hours prior to the time of the
commencement of the special general meeting); that is, by 9:00 a.m. local Bermuda time (8:00 a.m. Eastern
Time) on April 17, 2023; (2) submitting a valid, later dated proxy card in a timely manner that is received no
later than 48 hours prior to the time of the commencement of the special general meeting; that is, by 9:00 a.m.
local Bermuda time (8:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on April 17, 2023; (3) giving written notice of such revocation to
Argo Group’s corporate secretary (at Wellesley House, 90 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM 08, Bermuda),
which written notice is received at least 48 hours prior to the time of the commencement of the special
general meeting; that is, by 9:00 a.m. local Bermuda time (8:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on April 17, 2023; or (4)
attending and voting at the special general meeting, or any adjournment thereof (although attendance at the
meeting will not by itself revoke a proxy).
If your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, broker or other nominee, please follow the
instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to revoke your previously provided
voting instructions.

Recommendation of the Argo Group Board of Directors (Page 33)
The Argo Group board of directors unanimously (1) approved the merger agreement, the statutory
merger agreement and the merger, (2) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory
merger are in the best interests of Argo Group, (3) declared the advisability of the merger agreement, the
statutory merger agreement and the merger and (4) resolved to recommend approval of the merger, the merger
agreement and the statutory merger agreement to Argo Group’s shareholders (subject to the right of the
Argo Group board of directors to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation or terminate the merger
agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement). Accordingly, the Argo Group board of
directors unanimously recommends that Argo Group’s shareholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR”
the compensation advisory proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. See the section of this proxy
statement titled “The Merger - Argo Group’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Argo
Group Board of Directors” for the factors considered by the Argo Group board of directors in reaching its
determination that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement are in the best
interests of Argo Group.",12,13

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (which we refer to as “Goldman Sachs”) delivered its opinion to Argo
Group’s board of directors that, as of February 8, 2023 and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the $30.00 in cash per common share to be paid to the holders (other than
Brookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of common shares pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to such holders of common shares.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 8, 2023, which sets forth assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the
opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for
the information and assistance of Argo Group’s board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of common shares should vote with respect to
the merger or any other matter.
Pursuant to an engagement letter between Argo Group and Goldman Sachs, Argo Group has agreed to
pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of approximately $10.5 million, all of which is contingent upon
consummation of the merger.",13,13

Argo Group’s executive officers and directors may have interests in the merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, those of Argo Group’s shareholders generally. The Argo Group board of directors was
aware of and considered these interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters,
in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and
in recommending that the merger agreement be approved by the shareholders of Argo Group. As described in
more detail below, these interests potentially include:
for the Argo Group executive officers, if applicable, the accelerated vesting upon the closing of the
merger (or, solely with respect to the Argo Group cash awards, upon a qualifying termination of
employment following the closing of the merger), in each case, as described further below, of 55,563
Argo Group restricted shares (assuming performance levels for performance-vesting Argo Group
restricted shares as described in detail below) with an estimated aggregate value of $1,666,890 based
on the per share merger consideration of $30.00, Argo Group cash awards with an estimated aggregate
value of $12,281, and 135,000 Argo Group SARs with an estimated aggregate value of $0 based on an
exercise price of $43.80 per Argo Group SAR and the per share merger consideration of $30.00;

Treatment of Common Shares (Page 57)
At the effective time, each common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
(other than any common share that is owned by Argo Group as treasury shares, by Argo Group, Brookfield
Reinsurance, Merger Sub or wholly-owned subsidiaries of Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or any
common share that is subject to an Argo Group equity award) will be canceled and converted into the right
to receive the merger consideration of $30.00 in cash, without interest and less any required withholding
taxes.
Treatment of Preferred Shares (Page 58)
At the effective time, each preferred share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
will continue as a preferred share of Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger and the
relative rights, terms and conditions of each such preferred share will remain unchanged.
Treatment of Argo Group Equity Awards (Page 66)
The merger agreement provides that the Argo Group’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time:
Restricted Shares. Each Argo Group common share granted under Argo Group’s 2014 Long-Term
Incentive Plan and 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the “Argo Group share plans”) that is
subject to vesting restrictions and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (which we refer to as a
“Argo Group restricted share”) will (i) become fully vested, in the case of a time-based vesting Argo Group
restricted share, or become vested at an assumed level of performance, in the case of a performance-based
vesting Argo Group restricted share, based on the following: (a) if the effective time occurs prior to half-way
through the applicable performance period, then the number of Argo Group common shares in respect of
such performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share will be based on the applicable performance
goals being deemed to have been satisfied at the target level; and (b) if the effective time occurs on or after
half-way through the applicable performance period, then the number of Argo Group common shares in
respect of such performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share will be based on the projected actual
level of performance through the end of the applicable performance period, as determined by Argo Group
board of directors in accordance with the terms of the Argo Group share plans prior to the date of the
6 TABLE OF CONTENTS
effective time taking into account performance through the date of such determination (but, if the Argo
Group board of directors determines in good faith that the projected actual level of performance is not
reasonably determinable, the number of Argo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based
vesting Argo Group restricted share will be based on the target level), and (ii) be canceled and converted
into solely the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the sum of (x) the merger
consideration of $30.00 and (y) the value of any dividends accrued in respect of such Argo Group restricted
share that remain unpaid as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, less any required
withholding taxes.
Share Appreciation Rights. Each Argo Group share appreciation right award (which we refer to as a
“Argo Group SAR”) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be
deemed to be fully vested and will be canceled and converted into solely the right to receive a lump-sum
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any of (a) the merger consideration
of $30.00, over (b) the per share exercise price of such Argo Group SAR, multiplied by (ii) the total number of
Argo Group common shares subject to such Argo Group SAR immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, less any required withholding taxes.
Employee Share Purchase Plan. Prior to the effective time, Argo Group will take all actions necessary or
required under the Argo Group Employee Share Purchase Plan (which we refer to as the “ESPP”) to (i) cause
the purchase period then underway under the ESPP (which we refer to as the “final purchase period”) to be
terminated no later than four business days prior to the date on which the effective time occurs, (ii) make any
pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the final purchase period, but otherwise treat the final
purchase period as a fully effective and completed purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP,
(iii) cause the exercise (as of no later than four business days prior to the date on which the effective time
occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP and (iv) cause the ESPP to be terminated
immediately following the end of the final purchase period. Participants in the ESPP will not be permitted to
increase the percentage of their payroll deduction elections from those in effect as of February 8, 2023, and
no additional persons will be permitted to commence participation in the ESPP from and after February 8,
2023.
Save As You Earn (SAYE) Share Option Plan. Argo Group will use commercially reasonable efforts to
procure that participants holding outstanding share options (which we refer to as the “options”) under the
Save As You Earn Share Option Plan (which we refer to as the “UK ESPP”) will exercise their options
effective on the closing date in respect of the maximum number of Argo Group common shares possible
under the terms of their options as of the closing date, and receive, in respect of each such Argo Group
common share, the merger consideration of $30.00 in cash, without interest and less any required
withholding taxes. If a participant in the UK ESPP so exercises their options, at the closing date, the balance
of their options not so exercised, if any, will immediately lapse and the participant will have a right to receive
a compensation payment in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, in respect of such
unexercised options of an amount which is, once paid net of applicable income tax and employee’s social
security due on such gross amount, equal to (i) the merger consideration of $30.00 in respect of each Argo
Group common share underlying such unexercised options, less the applicable exercise price per such Argo
Group common share, multiplied by (ii) the number of Argo Group common shares that the participant would
otherwise have been able to acquire on exercise of their unexercised options at the latest possible time had
they continued to make savings under the terms of the UK ESPP for a period of up to six months from the
closing date. The UK ESPP participants will not be permitted to increase the percentage of their payroll
deduction elections from those in effect as of February 8, 2023, and no additional persons will be permitted
to commence participation in the UK ESPP from and after February 8, 2023. The Argo Group will take all
actions necessary or required to cause the UK ESPP to be terminated immediately following the exercise or
lapse of all options.
Regulatory Clearances Required for the Merger (Page 53)
Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (which we refer to as the “HSR Act”),
Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance cannot consummate the merger until Argo Group and Brookfield
Reinsurance have notified the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission
of the merger and furnished them with certain information and materials relating to the merger and the
applicable waiting period has terminated or expired.
The merger is also conditioned on the receipt of required regulatory approvals from (or notification to,
as applicable) regulatory authorities including, but not limited to, the Illinois Department of Insurance, the

No Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change; Alternative Acquisition Agreements
(Page 62)
Argo Group has agreed in the merger agreement that it will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and
its and their respective directors, officers and employees to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its other representatives to, not, among other things, solicit, encourage, initiate or take any action to
knowingly facilitate the submission of any inquiry or the making of any proposal, in each case, that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a “takeover proposal.”
If Argo Group receives a bona fide takeover proposal prior to the date Argo Group shareholders
approve the merger proposal that did not result from a breach by Argo Group of such non-solicitation
provisions, and the Argo Group board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with Argo
Group’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such takeover proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a “superior proposal,” then Argo Group may, subject to certain conditions,
enter into a confidentiality agreement with and furnish information (including non-public information) about
Argo Group and its subsidiaries to the person or group of persons making the takeover proposal and engage
in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or group of persons making such
takeover proposal.
The Argo Group board of directors has agreed to recommend approval of the merger proposal at the
special general meeting and that it will not change such recommendation, except in certain circumstances
described below.
However, the Argo Group board of directors may make an “adverse recommendation change” in
compliance with the terms of the merger agreement if the Argo Group board of directors has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law in response to either (i)
a superior proposal received by Argo Group or (ii) an “intervening event.”
Subject to the procedures set forth in the merger agreement, if Argo Group receives a superior proposal,
Argo Group may terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement in respect
of such superior proposal if the Argo Group board of directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. In such case Argo Group will be
required to pay Brookfield Reinsurance a $37,183,000 termination fee.
Argo Group is also permitted to waive any standstill provision to allow a third party to make a takeover
proposal to the Argo Group board of directors on a non-public basis if the Argo Group board of directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with Argo Group’s outside legal counsel, that failure to do so
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
See the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Takeover
Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change; Alternative Acquisition Agreement.”
Conditions to the Merger (Page 58)
The obligations of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance and Merger Sub to effect the merger are subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver by the applicable parties, if permissible under applicable law) of the following
conditions:
the merger proposal having been approved by Argo Group’s shareholders;
the required regulatory approvals having been obtained and being in full force and effect;

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 69)
The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time by mutual written
consent of Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance and, subject to certain limitations described in the merger
agreement, by either Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance if any of the following occurs:
the merger has not been consummated by November 8, 2023 (we refer to such date, as may be
automatically extended to February 8, 2024 under certain circumstances, as the “outside date”),
except that this right of termination is not available to any party whose breach of a representation or
warranty or failure to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement, failure to act in good
faith or failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions has been a principal
cause of the failure of the merger to occur on or before the outside date;
there is in effect any injunction, judgment or ruling, enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended
or enforced by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction enjoining, restraining or
otherwise making illegal, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the merger that is final and
nonappealable, except that this right of termination is only available if the applicable party has
performed, in all material respects, its obligations under the merger agreement, acted in good faith and
used reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of and to remove such restraint in accordance with
its obligations under the merger agreement;
if Argo Group’s shareholders do not approve the merger proposal following a vote thereon having
been taken at the special general meeting; or
there has been a breach by the other party of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in the merger agreement, which breach would result in the failure of certain
closing conditions relating to compliance with such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements to be satisfied on or prior to the outside date, and such breach is not capable of being
cured or has not been cured by the earlier of the outside date and 30 days after written notice of such
breach has been received by the party alleged to be in breach.
The merger agreement may be terminated by Brookfield Reinsurance at any time prior to the approval by
Argo Group’s shareholders of the merger proposal if the Argo Group board of directors makes an adverse
recommendation change. In such case, Argo Group will be required to pay Brookfield Reinsurance a
$37,183,000 termination fee.
Subject to the procedures set forth in the merger agreement, if Argo Group receives a superior proposal
and Argo Group’s shareholders have not yet approved the merger proposal, Argo Group may terminate the
merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement in respect of such superior proposal if
the Argo Group board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What will happen in the merger?
If the merger proposal is approved and all other conditions to the merger have been satisfied or waived,
Merger Sub will be merged with and into Argo Group, with Argo Group surviving the merger as an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance.
What will holders of common shares receive in the merger?
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement, each common share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than any common share that is
owned by Argo Group as treasury shares, by Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance, Merger Sub or
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or any common share that is
subject to an Argo Group equity award) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration of $30.00 in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes.
How does the merger consideration compare to the closing price of common shares prior to announcement of the
transaction?
The merger consideration represents a premium of 48.7% to the closing price of common shares on
September 7, 2022, the last full trading day prior to Argo Group announcing the sale of Argo
Underwriting Agency Limited and its Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 and the continuation of its strategic
alternatives review process, and a premium of 6.7% to the closing price of common shares on February
7, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the transaction.
What will happen to issued and outstanding preferred shares in the merger?
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each preferred share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time will continue as a preferred share of Argo Group as the surviving company
following the merger and the relative rights, terms and conditions of each such preferred share will
remain unchanged. Following the merger, Brookfield Reinsurance may cause the surviving company to
exercise any of its rights with respect to each preferred share issued and outstanding or the depositary
shares representing interests in such preferred shares.
Are shareholders able to exercise appraisal or dissenters’ rights?
Under Bermuda law, Argo Group shareholders of record have rights of appraisal, pursuant to which
those shareholders of Argo Group who do not vote in favor of the merger proposal and who are not
satisfied that they have been offered fair value for their shares will be permitted to apply to the Bermuda
Court for an appraisal of the fair value of their shares within one month from the giving of the notice
convening the special general meeting. See the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - 
Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal for Argo Group Shareholders” and “Appraisal Rights” for more

assurance that the parties will be able to do so. The closing is subject to customary closing conditions,
including approval by Argo Group shareholders and receipt of certain insurance and other regulatory
approvals.
See the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the
Merger” for more information.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
If the merger proposal is not approved by the requisite vote of Argo Group shareholders, or the merger

The continuation of preferred shares as preferred shares of Argo Group as the surviving company
following the merger will not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes for holders of
preferred shares. If you are a holder of preferred shares, you will not recognize any income, gain or loss

Why are holders of common shares being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve “golden
parachute compensation” that may be paid or become payable to Argo Group’s named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the merger?
The SEC, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
adopted rules that require Argo Group to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain
payments that will or may be made to Argo Group’s named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger. The compensation advisory proposal satisfies this requirement. See the
section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Interests of Argo Group’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” for more details on such payments.
What will happen if the holders of common shares do not approve the advisory (non-binding) compensation
advisory proposal?
The vote to approve the advisory (non-binding) compensation advisory proposal is a vote separate and
apart from the vote to adopt the merger proposal. Approval of the advisory (non-binding) compensation
advisory proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger and is advisory in nature only,
meaning
15 
Q: 
A: 
Q: 
A: 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that it will not be binding on Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or any of their respective
subsidiaries. Accordingly, if the Argo Group shareholders approve the merger proposal and the merger
is consummated, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger will or may be
payable to Argo Group’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of the underlying
compensation agreements and arrangements, even if this proposal is not approved.
Do any of Argo Group’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to
the interests of Argo Group shareholders?
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the board of directors with respect to the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests
in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Argo Group shareholders
generally. The Argo Group board of directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent
such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement, in
approving the merger agreement and the merger and in recommending that the merger agreement be
approved by the shareholders of Argo Group. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement titled “The Merger - Interests of Argo Group’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger” for a more detailed discussion of these interests.
I am an employee of Argo Group who holds Argo Group equity awards. How will my Argo Group equity awards be
treated in the merger?
The merger agreement provides that the Argo Group’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time:
Restricted Shares. Each Argo Group restricted share will (i) become fully vested, in the case of a time-
based vesting Argo Group restricted share, or become vested at an assumed level of performance, in the
case of a performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share, based on the following: (a) if the
effective time occurs prior to half-way through the applicable performance period, then the number of
Argo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share
will be based on the applicable performance goals being deemed to have been satisfied at the target
level; and (b) if the effective time occurs on or after half-way through the applicable performance period,
then the number of Argo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo
Group restricted share will be based on the projected actual level of performance through the end of the
applicable performance period, as determined by Argo Group board of directors in accordance with the
terms of the Argo Group share plans prior to the date of the effective time taking into account
performance through the date of such determination (but, if the Argo Group board of directors
determines in good faith that the projected actual level of performance is not reasonably determinable,
the number of Argo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo Group
restricted share will be based on the target level), and (ii) be canceled and converted into solely the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the sum of (x) the merger consideration of
$30.00 and (y) the value of any dividends accrued in respect of such Argo Group restricted share that
remain unpaid as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, less any required withholding
taxes.
Share Appreciation Rights. Each Argo Group SAR outstanding immediately prior to the effective time,
whether vested or unvested, will be deemed to be fully vested and will be canceled and converted into
solely the right to receive a lump-sum amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any of (a) the merger consideration of $30.00, over (b) the per share exercise price of such
Argo Group SAR, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Argo Group common shares subject to such
Argo Group SAR immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, less any required withholding
taxes.
Employee Share Purchase Plan. Prior to the effective time, Argo Group will take all actions necessary or
required under the ESPP to (i) cause the final purchase period under the ESPP to be terminated no later
than four business days prior to the date on which the effective time occurs, (ii) make any pro rata
adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the final purchase period, but otherwise treat the final
purchase period as a fully effective and completed purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the
ESPP, (iii) cause the exercise (as of no later than four business days prior to the date on which the
effective time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP and (iv) cause the ESPP
to be
16 
Q:

A: 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
terminated immediately following the end of the final purchase period. Participants in the ESPP will not
be permitted to increase the percentage of their payroll deduction elections from those in effect as of
February 8, 2023, and no additional persons will be permitted to commence participation in the ESPP
from and after February 8, 2023.
Save As You Earn (SAYE) Share Option Plan. Argo Group will use commercially reasonable efforts to
procure that participants holding outstanding options under the UK ESPP will exercise their options
effective on the closing date in respect of the maximum number of Argo Group common shares possible
under the terms of their options as of the closing date, and receive, in respect of each such Argo Group
common share, the merger consideration of $30.00 in cash, without interest and less any required
withholding taxes. If a participant in the UK ESPP so exercises their options, at the closing date, the
balance of their options not so exercised, if any, will immediately lapse and the participant will have a
right to receive a compensation payment in cash, without interest and less any required withholding
taxes, in respect of such unexercised options of an amount which is, once paid net of applicable income
tax and employee’s social security due on such gross amount, equal to (i) the merger consideration of
$30.00 in respect of each Argo Group common share underlying such unexercised options, less the
applicable exercise price per such Argo Group common share, multiplied by (ii) the number of Argo
Group common shares that the participant would otherwise have been able to acquire on exercise of
their unexercised options at the latest possible time had they continued to make savings under the
terms of the UK ESPP for a period of up to six months from the closing date. Participants in the UK ESPP
will not be permitted to increase the percentage of their payroll deduction elections from those in effect
as of February 8, 2023, and no additional persons will be permitted to commence participation in the UK
ESPP from and after February 8, 2023. The Argo Group will take all actions necessary or required to
cause the UK ESPP to be terminated immediately following the exercise or lapse of all options.
What is the required quorum for the special general meeting?
Pursuant to Argo Group’s Bye-Laws, a majority of the outstanding shares carrying the right to vote,
present in person or represented by proxy, constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the
special general meeting.
Each common share and preferred share carries the right to vote on the merger proposal and the
adjournment proposal. Accordingly, the quorum required at the special general meeting to consider the
merger proposal and the adjournment proposal is the presence in person or represented by proxy of
shareholders representing in excess of 50% of the total voting power of all outstanding common shares
and preferred shares, voting as one class, as of the record date. Only common shares carry the right to
vote on the compensation advisory proposal. Accordingly, the quorum required at the special general
meeting to consider the compensation advisory proposal is the presence in person or represented by
proxy of shareholders representing in excess of 50% of the total voting power of all common shares as
of the record date
What shareholder vote is required to approve the items to be voted on at the special general meeting, including
the merger?
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding common shares and preferred shares, voting as one class, that are entitled to vote at
the special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws.
The approval of the compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast by holders of common shares that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled
to vote at the special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws.
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting
power of holders of common shares and preferred shares, voting as one class, that are present in person
or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special general meeting in accordance with Argo
Group’s Bye-Laws.

all proposals presented to shareholders will be considered non-discretionary, your broker, bank or other
nominee will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on any of the proposals without your
instructions and accordingly, there will not be any broker non-votes at the special general meeting.
Broker non-votes (if any) will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and
will not count as votes cast at the special general meeting.
Because approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power
of the outstanding common shares and preferred shares, voting as one class, that are entitled to vote at
the special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws (assuming a quorum is present),
an abstention will have the effect of a vote against the merger proposal. Because approval of the
compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders
of common shares that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special
general meeting (assuming a quorum is present), an abstention with respect to the compensation
advisory proposal will not have the effect of a vote for or against the compensation advisory proposal,
but will reduce the number of votes cast and therefore increase the relative influence of those
shareholders voting. Because approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding common shares and preferred shares, voting as one
class, that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special general
meeting, an abstention with respect to the adjournment proposal will have the effect of a vote against
the adjournment proposal, but common shares or preferred shares deemed not in attendance at the
special general meeting, whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s
failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee, will have no
effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal.
Does Brookfield Reinsurance have the financial resources to complete the merger?
Yes. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition or contingency. Brookfield Reinsurance has
informed us that it has the financial resources to complete the merger and it expects to use existing cash
on hand and liquidity available to Brookfield Reinsurance to fund the aggregate merger consideration.
Who is entitled to vote at the special general meeting and what is the record date?
Only Argo Group shareholders of record, as shown on Argo Group’s register of members at the close of
business on March 16, 2023, the record date for the special general meeting, will be entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, the special general meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Holders of
common shares will be entitled to vote on all proposals, whereas holders of preferred shares will be
entitled to vote only on the merger proposal and the adjournment proposal.
If you hold your shares in “street name” beneficially through a bank, broker or nominee, you must
follow the procedures required by your bank, broker or other nominee. You should contact your bank,
broker or other nominee, as applicable, for more information on these procedures.
What do l need to do now?
We urge you to carefully read this proxy statement, including its annexes and the documents
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement. You are also encouraged to review the documents

How do I vote my shares?
Shareholder of Record. If your common or preferred shares are registered directly in your name, then
you are considered a shareholder of record of Argo Group with respect to those shares and this proxy
statement and the enclosed proxy card were sent to you directly by Argo Group. As an Argo Group
shareholder of record, you may vote by completing, dating, signing and mailing the enclosed proxy card
in the return envelope provided as soon as possible or by following the instructions on the proxy card
to submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet at the website indicated. Please note that under
Argo Group’s Bye-Laws, all proxies (whether submitted by mail, telephone or Internet) must be received
48 hours prior to the time of the commencement of the special general meeting. This means that your
proxy must be received by 9:00 a.m. local Bermuda time (8:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on April 17, 2023. Argo
Group shareholders of record may also vote by attending the special general meeting in person.
However, whether or not you plan to attend the special general meeting in person, we encourage you to
vote your common shares or preferred shares in advance to ensure that your vote is represented at the
special general meeting.
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or
other similar organization or nominee, then you are considered a beneficial owner of such shares held
for you in what is known as “street name.” Most shareholders of Argo Group hold their shares in
“street name.” If this is the case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker
or other organization or nominee together with a voting instruction form. You may vote by completing
and returning your voting instruction form to your broker. Please review the voting instruction form to
see if you are able to submit your voting instructions by telephone or over the Internet. The
organization or nominee holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of
voting at the special general meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct the
organization that holds your shares of record how to vote the common shares or preferred shares that
you beneficially own. Because all proposals presented to shareholders will be considered non-
discretionary, your broker, bank or other nominee will not have discretionary authority to vote your
shares on any of the proposals without your instructions and accordingly, there will not be any broker
non-votes at the special general meeting. Broker non-votes (if any) will not be considered present for
the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the special general meeting.
Owner of Depositary Shares in Respect of Preferred Shares. Holders of depositary shares must act
through the depositary to exercise any voting rights in respect of the preferred shares (or fractions
thereof) represented thereby and the depositary will vote preferred shares held by it in accordance with
the terms of its depositary agreement. If you hold depositary shares, you may vote by completing and
returning your voting instruction form in accordance with the instructions therein. If you hold
depositary shares, you must submit a voting instruction form no later than 9:00 a.m. local Bermuda time
(8:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on April 13, 2023.
What do I need for admission at the special general meeting?
All shareholders attending the special general meeting in person will be required to show valid picture
identification. If your shares are in the name of your bank, broker or other nominee, you will also need
to bring evidence of your share ownership as of the record date, such as a brokerage account statement
which shows your holdings as of the record date or a copy of your voting instruction form. If you do
not have valid picture identification or proof of your share ownership, you may not be admitted to the
meeting. For security purposes, packages and bags will be inspected and you may be required to check
these items. Please arrive early enough to allow yourself adequate time to clear security.
Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and who desire to
vote in person at the meeting must obtain a legal proxy.
What do I do if I want to change my vote?
If your common shares are registered directly in your name, then you are considered a shareholder of
record of Argo Group with respect to those shares and this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card

event no later than 48 hours prior to the time of the commencement of the special general meeting);

submitting a valid, later dated proxy card in a timely manner that is received no later than 48 hours
prior to the time of the commencement of the special general meeting; that is, by 9:00 a.m. local

Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM 08, Bermuda), which written notice is received at least 48 hours prior to
the time of the commencement of the special general meeting; that is, by 9:00 a.m. local Bermuda time
(8:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on April 17, 2023; or
attending and voting at the special general meeting, or any adjournment thereof (although attendance
at the meeting will not by itself revoke a proxy).
If your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, broker or other nominee, please follow the
instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to revoke or change your
previously provided voting instructions.
If I hold my shares in certificated form, should I send in my share certificates now?
No. You should NOT return your share certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not
forward your share certificates to the paying agent (see the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger - Payment of Merger Consideration and Surrender of Share Certificates” for a more detailed
discussion) without a letter of transmittal. Promptly after the effective time, each shareholder of record
of a certificate representing common shares that has been converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration will be sent a letter of transmittal describing the procedure for surrendering its shares in
exchange for the merger consideration. If you hold your shares in certificated form, you will receive your
cash payment after the paying agent receives your share certificates and any other documents
requested in the instructions.
If I hold my shares in book-entry form, how will I receive payment when the merger occurs?
If you hold shares in non-certificated book-entry form that have been converted into the right to receive
the merger consideration, you will receive your cash payment in respect of those shares as promptly as
practicable following the effective time and the paying agent’s receipt of the documents that it requests
from you, if any.
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
Argo Group has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the
special general meeting. Argo Group estimates that it will pay Innisfree M&A Incorporated a fee of
approximately $40,000 and reimbursement of certain expenses.
Who should Argo Group shareholders contact with any additional questions?

The Argo Group board of directors and Argo Group’s senior management periodically review Argo
Group’s operations, financial condition, financial performance and long-term strategic plans and objectives,
as well as industry conditions, regulatory developments and their impact on Argo Group’s long-term
strategic plan and objectives. During the past two years, the Argo Group board of directors has reviewed
and considered the current and future industry trends and risks to Argo Group’s ability to execute its
strategic plan as a stand-alone entity, including the impact of adverse development of Argo Group’s loss
reserves, continuing consolidation in the insurance and reinsurance industry, losses incurred within the
insurance and reinsurance industry and increasingly competitive pricing in many of the insurance and
reinsurance markets in which Argo Group operates. In connection with Argo Group’s strategic review
process and consideration of a potential transaction, between April 2022 and February 8, 2023 (the date of
the announcement of the transaction with Brookfield Reinsurance), the Argo Group board of directors and
the strategic review committee of the board of directors (the “strategic review committee”) collectively met
over 40 times.
Beginning in September 2021, Argo Group received requests from a shareholder of Argo Group to,
among other things, initiate a review of potential strategic alternatives, including a sale of Argo Group.
On March 23, 2022, another institutional shareholder of Argo Group sent a letter to the Argo Group
board of directors requesting, among other things, that the Argo Group board of directors initiate a review of
potential strategic alternatives, including a sale of Argo Group.
On March 28, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met to discuss, among other things, Argo Group’s
long term strategic plan and the possibility of initiating a review of potential strategic alternatives, including
a sale of Argo Group.
Between March 28, 2022 and April 26, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors, together with members
of Argo Group’s senior management team, representatives of Goldman Sachs, Argo Group’s financial advisor,
and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), Argo Group’s outside legal counsel, discussed
and evaluated the possibility of initiating a strategic review process for Argo Group. Management solicited
and received input from certain shareholders during this time period, and this feedback was shared with the
Argo Group board of directors to inform its decision with respect to commencing a strategic review process.
24 TABLE OF CONTENTS
On April 21, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs, Skadden and ASW Law Limited (“ASW”), Argo Group’s outside Bermuda legal
counsel. At the meeting, representatives of Skadden and ASW presented to the directors regarding the legal
principles and standards that would apply if the Argo Group board of directors were to consider a potential
transaction. The directors also discussed, among other things, the possibility of initiating a strategic review
process and certain related matters, including communications guidelines and best practices, preparing
financial projections and the scope of outreach to potential counterparties. Representatives of Skadden also
reviewed with the Argo Group board of directors a proposed form of engagement letter for engaging
Goldman Sachs to serve as Argo Group’s financial advisor in connection with a potential strategic review
process. Goldman Sachs had previously been engaged by Argo Group to assist with shareholder activism
matters in connection with Argo Group’s 2022 annual general meeting of shareholders.
On April 26, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, at which meeting, among other things, the board of
directors determined to initiate a strategic review process for Argo Group, including exploring a potential
sale, merger or other strategic transaction with respect to Argo Group.
Later on April 26, 2022, Argo Group engaged Goldman Sachs to serve as its financial advisor in
connection with the strategic review process, including the possible sale of all or a portion of Argo Group.
On April 28, 2022, Argo Group issued a press release announcing that it was initiating a strategic review
process to explore potential strategic alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value, including, among
other things, a potential sale, merger or other strategic transaction.
Later on April 28, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the Argo Group
board of directors, began outreach to a list of potential counterparties approved by Argo Group, including
sharing a form of confidentiality agreement with such potential counterparties. During the nine-month period
between April 2022 and the time of entry into the merger agreement with Brookfield Reinsurance, more than
80 potentially interested parties were contacted at the direction of the Argo Group board of directors.
On May 4, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, (i) the status of outreach
to potential counterparties, (ii) the confidential information memorandum prepared by Argo Group’s
management with the assistance of Goldman Sachs to be provided to any potential counterparties that
entered into confidentiality agreements with Argo Group, (iii) the status of negotiations of confidentiality
agreements with potential counterparties, (iv) Goldman Sachs’ assessment of the level of interest expressed
by the parties it had contacted with respect to a potential strategic transaction with Argo Group and (v)
Goldman Sachs’ anticipated timeline for management presentations to potential counterparties.
From May 4, 2022 through May 23, 2022, Argo Group entered into confidentiality agreements with 18
counterparties in connection with its initial outreach process regarding a potential sale of Argo Group, all of
which included customary standstill provisions (including “don’t ask, don’t waive” provisions). Each such
confidentiality agreement contained an exception to the “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision allowing for the
counterparty to make a confidential proposal to the Argo Group board of directors at any time.
On June 1, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, (i) the feedback received
from potential counterparties who had entered into confidentiality agreements with Argo Group with respect
to a potential transaction, (ii) materials that were provided to such parties in connection with their ongoing
due diligence, including the confidential information memorandum, and (iii) the anticipated timeline for due
diligence being conducted by potential counterparties. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also informed the
Argo Group board of directors that, in connection with its outreach to potential counterparties, the Westfield
Group (“Westfield”) had communicated interest to Argo Group’s Chief Financial Officer in potentially
acquiring, or having one of its affiliates acquire, Argo Group’s Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business and the
directors discussed possibly pursuing a sale of the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business to Westfield as part of
the ongoing strategic review process. The Argo Group board of directors also determined to form the
strategic review committee, which initially consisted of Thomas A. Bradley (Chair), Bernard Bailey, Fred
Donner and Dymphna Lehane, in order to (i) explore, consider and examine all potential transactions with
respect to Argo

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Group that the strategic review committee determined to be advisable to consider in the course of the
strategic review process and (ii) make recommendations to the Argo Group board of directors concerning
potential transactions that the strategic review committee deemed appropriate, including a recommendation
as to whether the final terms of any such potential transaction were in the best interests of Argo Group and
should be approved by the Argo Group board of directors and, if applicable, by Argo Group’s shareholders.
The strategic review committee was not obligated to take any specific action with respect to any potential
transaction and was permitted to take no action if it deemed advisable.
On June 21, 2022, three parties, which we refer to as “Party A,” “Party B” and “Party C” submitted
initial, non-binding indications of interest to representatives of Goldman Sachs with respect to a potential
transaction with Argo Group, which were communicated to the Argo Group board of directors. Party A
proposed a stock-for-stock merger with pro forma ownership of 48% for Argo’s existing shareholders and
52% for Party A’s shareholders following completion of the proposed transaction and an implied value of
$49.71 per Argo Group common share, with such pro forma ownership split and implied per common share
value based on Party A’s valuation assumptions which Argo Group had not yet been able to verify through
diligence. Party A also stated that in connection with its proposed transaction, it would expect to release up
to $500 million of excess capital to repurchase shares from Argo Group shareholders following completion of
the transaction. Party B proposed to acquire Argo Group for $40.00 per common share in cash, which
represented a 4.17% premium to the then-current trading price of Argo Group’s common shares. Party C
proposed to acquire Argo Group for cash consideration at or around the then-current trading price of Argo
Group’s common shares. On that same day, two other parties also submitted indications of interest in
acquiring certain core business lines of Argo Group, but not in a whole company acquisition of Argo Group.
On June 27, 2022, Argo Group received an initial, non-binding indication of interest from Ohio Farmers
Insurance Company (“Ohio Farmers”), part of Westfield, pursuant to which Ohio Farmers proposed to
acquire the entire issued share capital of Argo Underwriting Agency Limited, the entity operating Argo
Group’s Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business.
On June 29, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the status of the
strategic review process, including the indication of interest received from Ohio Farmers with respect to the
acquisition of the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business and the five preliminary indications of interest received
on June 21, 2022. Following review of the three indications of interest for a whole company merger or
acquisition of Argo Group, including discussions with the members of management present at the meeting
regarding (i) feedback received from potential interested parties regarding the need for Argo Group to
advance simplification of its portfolio, exit international business lines and improve its reserve positions in
order for such parties to further consider a potential business combination transaction with Argo Group and
(ii) the potential for one or more of the offer prices in the preliminary indications of interest to be decreased
following further diligence by the parties, the Argo Group board of directors determined to pursue the sale of
the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business to Ohio Farmers and to pause its outreach process to interested parties
regarding a whole company merger or sale of Argo Group until it had entered into a definitive agreement with
Ohio Farmers to sell the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business, which, based on interested party feedback, the
Argo Group board of directors believed would potentially increase the number of parties interested in
pursuing a whole company business combination transaction with Argo Group.
During July and early August of 2022, Argo Group evaluated and discussed a potential loss portfolio
transfer agreement with Enstar Group Limited (“Enstar”) and its affiliates, including providing due diligence
information to Enstar.
On August 2 and 3, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo
Group’s management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, at which, among other things, the board of
directors discussed the impact of potential strategic transactions being considered by Argo Group, including
a potential sale of the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business, on the financial projections prepared by Argo
Group’s management that were previously distributed to parties that had entered into confidentiality
agreements with Argo Group.
On August 4, 2022, following a review of his qualifications and background, Argo Group’s board of
directors appointed J. Daniel Plants as an independent director. Mr. Plants was also appointed as the chair of
the strategic review committee on September 1, 2022.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 8, 2022, Argo Group issued a press release announcing that it had entered into a loss
portfolio transfer agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of Enstar covering a majority of Argo Group’s
U.S. casualty insurance reserves, including construction, for accident years 2011 to 2019 (the “LPT”). The
LPT is expected to provide protection against reserve volatility and provide the Argo Group with additional
capital flexibility.
During August and early September of 2022, Argo Group evaluated and discussed a potential sale of its
Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business to Ohio Farmers, including providing due diligence information to Ohio
Farmers.
On September 8, 2022, Argo Group issued a press release announcing that it had entered into a
definitive agreement for the sale of Argo Underwriting Agency Limited and its Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200
business to Ohio Farmers for total cash proceeds of approximately $125 million (1.16x price to tangible book
value or 0.81x price to book value as of first quarter 2022), subject to closing-related adjustments. The press
release also noted that as part of Argo Group’s previously announced and ongoing review of strategic
alternatives, the Argo Group board of directors was continuing to actively consider a wide range of options
for Argo Group. In connection with the announcement, Argo Group also distributed an investor presentation
regarding the strategic review developments, including the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 sale and the LPT.
Following the announcement of the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 sale, the Argo Group board of directors
instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to conduct additional outreach to a list of potential interested
parties approved by Argo Group regarding a business combination transaction. Between September 11, 2022
and October 7, 2022, Argo Group entered into confidentiality agreements with nine additional counterparties,
all of which included customary standstill provisions (including “don’t ask, don’t waive” provisions). Each
such confidentiality agreement contained an exception to the “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision allowing for
the counterparty to make a confidential proposal to the Argo Group board of directors at any time.
On September 30, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the status of outreach to
potential interested parties regarding a business combination transaction following the announcement of the
LPT and the sale of the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business. At the meeting, representatives from Argo Group’s
management presented updated financial projections to the directors that reflected the expected impact of
the LPT and Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 sale.
On October 10, 2022, the strategic review committee met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present. At the meeting, the members of the strategic review
committee were presented with an updated confidential information memorandum that would be provided to
potential counterparties that entered into confidentiality agreements with Argo Group, which included
updated management financial projections reflecting the expected impact of the LPT and the Lloyd’s
Syndicate 1200 sale.
On October 24, 2022, Fred Donner informed Argo Group that he did not intend to stand for re-election to
the board of directors at the 2022 annual general meeting of shareholders to be held on December 15, 2022,
and would step down from the board of directors and the strategic review committee immediately upon the
commencement of the 2022 annual general meeting.
On October 31, 2022, Argo Group received a revised, non-binding indication of interest from Party B,
pursuant to which Party B proposed to acquire Argo Group for $26.50 per common share in cash.
Later that day, Argo Group also received an initial, non-binding indication of interest from an additional
party, which we refer to as “Party D,” pursuant to which Party D proposed that Argo Group and a portfolio
company of Party D enter into either (i) a stock-for-stock merger, pursuant to which Argo Group would issue
new shares to acquire 100% of Party D’s portfolio company at a valuation to be agreed upon or (ii) a minority
stock-for-stock exchange whereby Argo Group would issue no more than 19.9% of its outstanding shares to
Party D’s portfolio company in exchange for shares of the portfolio company at an exchange ratio to be
agreed upon.
On November 1, 2022, Argo Group received an initial, non-binding indication of interest from Brookfield
Reinsurance, pursuant to which Brookfield Reinsurance proposed to acquire all of the outstanding common
27 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares of Argo Group for $30.00 per common share in cash. Argo Group also received a revised, non-binding
indication of interest for a reverse merger transaction from Party A and an initial, non-binding indication of
interest for a reverse merger transaction from an additional party, which we refer to as “Party E.” Party A
proposed a stock-for-stock merger with pro forma ownership of 35-37% for Argo’s existing shareholders and
63-65% for Party A’s shareholders following completion of the proposed transaction and an implied value
ranging from $29.78 to $33.09 for each Argo Group common share, with such pro forma ownership split and
implied per common share value based on Party A’s valuation assumptions which Argo Group had not yet
been able to verify through diligence. Party A also stated that in connection with its proposed transaction, it
would expect to release up to $500 million of excess capital to repurchase shares from Argo Group
shareholders following completion of the transaction. Party E proposed a stock-for-stock merger with pro
forma ownership of 41.2% for existing Argo shareholders and 58.8% for Party E’s shareholders following
completion of the proposed transaction and an implied value of $40.40 per Argo Group common share, with
such pro forma ownership split and implied per common share value based on Party E’s valuation
assumptions which Argo Group had not yet been able to verify through diligence. Party C did not submit a
revised indication of interest as part of the outreach process following the announcement of the sale of the
Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business.
On November 3, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the five proposals
received earlier that week. After reviewing the terms of each proposal, the directors determined to permit
each party that had submitted a proposal other than Party D to conduct further due diligence of Argo Group
in connection with a potential transaction. The directors determined that the structure and potential value
proposition of the proposal submitted by Party D was not attractive in comparison to the other four
proposals received to merit continuing discussions with Party D.
On November 7, 2022, Argo Group reported its earnings results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022,
including announcing a net adverse prior year reserve development of $16.2 million or 4.9 percentage points
on the loss ratio (as compared to $0.2 million or 0.1 percentage points on the loss ratio for the third quarter of
fiscal year 2021).
From November 10, 2022 through November 18, 2022, Argo Group held management presentations with
Brookfield Reinsurance, Party A, Party B and Party E at Skadden’s New York office.
On November 17, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the Argo Group
board of directors, distributed a second round process letter to Brookfield Reinsurance, Party A, Party B and
Party E.
On November 21, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the Argo Group
board of directors, distributed a draft merger agreement prepared by Skadden to Brookfield Reinsurance,
Party A, Party B and Party E.
Later on November 21, 2022, the strategic review committee met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the status of the
ongoing due diligence being conducted by Brookfield Reinsurance, Party A, Party B and Party E, and related
discussions with such parties regarding a potential transaction.
On December 8, 2022, Party B notified representatives of Goldman Sachs that it was no longer interested
in considering a possible strategic transaction with Argo Group.
On December 11, 2022, an additional party, which we refer to as “Party F,” submitted an initial, non-
binding indication of interest to representatives of Goldman Sachs, pursuant to which Party F proposed to
acquire Argo Group for consideration in the range of $30.00-33.00 per common share, consisting of a mix of
cash and Party F’s stock.
On December 12, 2022, the strategic review committee met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management and Goldman Sachs present, to discuss, among other things, the status of reverse due diligence
being conducted by Argo Group with respect to Party A and Party E, in light of the reverse merger structures
included in their respective proposals, and the status of due diligence of Argo Group being conducted by
Brookfield Reinsurance, Party A and Party E. The directors also reviewed the proposal received from Party F
28 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
on December 11, 2022, and following review of the terms of such proposal, determined to permit Party F to
conduct further due diligence with respect to a potential transaction with Argo Group.
On December 13, 2022, Party A informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that it was no longer
interested in considering a possible strategic transaction with Argo Group.
On December 21, 2022, Brookfield Reinsurance submitted a revised proposal to acquire Argo Group for
consideration of $30.50 per common share in cash, which proposal was conditioned on Argo Group granting
Brookfield Reinsurance a five week exclusivity period to negotiate and finalize the terms of a potential
transaction.
Also on December 21, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the Argo Group
board of directors, provided Party F with a second round process letter and draft merger agreement prepared
by Skadden.
On December 28, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the status of the
strategic review process, including the status and expected closing date of the sale of the Lloyd’s Syndicate
1200 business to Ohio Farmers and the revised proposal received from Brookfield Reinsurance on December
21, 2022, to acquire Argo Group for $30.50 per common share in cash, conditioned upon Argo Group agreeing
to a five week exclusivity period with Brookfield Reinsurance during which the parties would negotiate and
finalize the terms of a potential transaction. The directors determined not to grant exclusivity to Brookfield
Reinsurance at that time so that they could provide Party E and Party F the opportunity to conduct
additional due diligence and submit revised proposals in early January 2023.
On January 11, 2023, Party F verbally submitted a revised proposal to acquire Argo Group for
consideration (consisting of a mix of cash and Party F’s stock) that was meaningfully below the then-current
trading price of Argo Group’s common shares.
On January 18, 2023, Brookfield Reinsurance submitted an updated proposal to representatives of
Goldman Sachs to acquire Argo Group for consideration of $29.50 per common share in cash, which proposal
was conditioned on (i) Voce agreeing to enter into a voting agreement to vote its Argo Group common shares
in favor of the approval of a transaction with Brookfield Reinsurance and (ii) a two-week exclusivity period
between Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance. Concurrently with the submission of the updated proposal
by Brookfield Reinsurance, representatives of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP (“Debevoise”), outside legal
counsel to Brookfield Reinsurance, submitted a revised draft of the merger agreement and a draft exclusivity
agreement to representatives of Skadden.
On January 18, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the updated proposals
received from Brookfield Reinsurance and Party F. The directors concluded that Party F’s latest proposal did
not offer sufficient value to Argo Group shareholders. The directors also discussed anticipated timing for
receiving an updated proposal from Party E in relation to Brookfield Reinsurance’s request for a two week
exclusivity period. The directors instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to inform Party E that it
needed to submit a revised proposal in the next several days and determined to schedule another board
meeting for January 22, 2023 to further discuss Brookfield Reinsurance’s pending exclusivity request.
On January 22, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs, Skadden and ASW present. At the meeting, the representatives from Skadden
and ASW reviewed with the Argo Group board of directors the legal principles and standards applicable to
its consideration of a proposed transaction and also reviewed a disclosure letter provided by Goldman Sachs
that described material relationships between Goldman Sachs and Brookfield Reinsurance, Party E and Party
F, as well as certain other related parties and Voce. The directors concluded that, based upon the disclosure
letter provided by Goldman Sachs and the relationships described therein, Goldman Sachs did not have any
material conflicts of interest that would interfere with its ability to serve as Argo Group’s financial advisor in
connection with a potential transaction involving Brookfield Reinsurance, Party E or Party F. Representatives
of Goldman Sachs then joined the meeting and together with members of Argo Group’s management,
reviewed the financial projections prepared by Argo Group management and the preliminary financial
analyses prepared by Goldman Sachs based upon management’s projections. The representatives of
Goldman Sachs
29 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
also provided an overview of the revised proposal received from Brookfield Reinsurance to acquire Argo
Group for $29.50 per common share in cash and Brookfield Reinsurance’s request for a two week exclusivity
period. Following these discussions and in light of the fact that Party E had still not submitted an updated
proposal, the Argo Group board of directors authorized representatives of Goldman Sachs to make a
counterproposal to Brookfield Reinsurance whereby (i) Brookfield Reinsurance would increase its offer price
to $31.50 per common share in cash and (ii) Argo Group would agree to enter into exclusivity with Brookfield
Reinsurance through January 31, 2023.
Later on January 22, 2023, representatives of Skadden sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Debevoise.
On January 23, 2023, Brookfield Reinsurance communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that it
would be willing to increase its offer price to $31.00 per common share in cash, subject to Argo Group
agreeing to (i) suspend quarterly dividends on its common shares between signing and closing of a potential
transaction, (ii) a termination fee of 4.0% of the transaction equity value to be payable under the
circumstances set forth in the merger agreement and (iii) enter into exclusivity with Brookfield Reinsurance
through January 31, 2023 in order to allow Brookfield Reinsurance to complete further due diligence. In a
subsequent discussion, representatives of Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the Argo Group board
of directors, indicated that Argo Group would be willing to enter into exclusivity with Brookfield Reinsurance
on that basis, subject to Brookfield Reinsurance agreeing to a termination fee of 3.5% of the transaction
equity value to be payable under the circumstances set forth in the merger agreement.
On January 24, 2023, Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance entered into an exclusivity agreement (the
“exclusivity agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Argo Group agreed to continue
discussions on an exclusive basis with Brookfield Reinsurance regarding a possible transaction until the
earliest of (i) 6:00 p.m., New York Time, on January 31, 2023, (ii) Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance
executing a definitive written agreement for the consummation of a possible transaction, (iii) the date that
Brookfield Reinsurance notified Argo Group in writing that Brookfield Reinsurance was no longer interested
in pursuing a possible transaction on the terms and conditions set forth in the exclusivity agreement and (iv)
the date Argo Group notified Brookfield Reinsurance in writing that Argo Group was no longer interested in
pursuing a possible transaction as a result of Brookfield Reinsurance (A) modifying or proposing to modify
the terms and conditions set forth in the exclusivity agreement or (B) introducing or proposing to introduce
any term or condition that was inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the exclusivity
agreement.
From January 24, 2023 until February 8, 2023, Argo Group and its advisors negotiated with Brookfield
Reinsurance and its advisors to finalize the terms of a potential transaction and Argo Group provided due
diligence information to Brookfield Reinsurance.
Also on January 24, 2023, representatives of Skadden sent an initial draft of the voting agreement
prepared by representatives of Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP (“Schulte”), outside legal counsel to Voce, to
representatives of Debevoise.
From January 26, 2023 to January 29, 2023, representatives of Skadden and Debevoise exchanged drafts
of the merger agreement and related transaction documents. During this same period, representatives of
Debevoise, Schulte and Skadden also exchanged drafts of the voting agreement.
On January 30, 2023, Brookfield Reinsurance communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs via
email that it had identified certain outstanding diligence items that it would need to obtain further
information on and resolve prior to entering into a transaction with Argo Group and that until such diligence
items had been resolved, Brookfield Reinsurance was not willing to engage further with respect to
negotiation of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.
On January 31, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present. Representatives of Goldman Sachs updated the board of
directors on the remaining diligence items identified by Brookfield Reinsurance earlier that day and the steps
being taken by Argo Group’s management and Goldman Sachs to resolve these points in order to resume
negotiations of the transaction documents. The Argo Group board of directors also authorized an extension
of the exclusivity period with Brookfield Reinsurance, if requested by Brookfield Reinsurance, in order to
provide additional time to resolve the remaining diligence issues.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 31, 2023, Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance entered into an amendment to the
exclusivity agreement, pursuant to which Argo Group agreed to extend the exclusivity period with Brookfield
Reinsurance until the earliest of (i) 6:00 p.m., New York Time, on February 6, 2023, (ii) the execution and
delivery by Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance of a definitive written agreement for the consummation
of a possible transaction, (iii) the date that Brookfield Reinsurance notified Argo Group in writing that
Brookfield Reinsurance was no longer interested in pursuing a possible transaction on the terms and
conditions set forth in the exclusivity agreement and (iv) the date Argo Group notified Brookfield
Reinsurance in writing that Argo Group was no longer interested in pursuing a possible transaction as a
result of Brookfield Reinsurance (A) modifying or proposing to modify the terms and conditions set forth in
the exclusivity agreement or (B) introducing or proposing to introduce any term or condition that was
inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the exclusivity agreement.
On February 1, 2023, representatives of Debevoise sent a revised draft of the voting agreement to
representatives of Schulte and Skadden.
On February 2, 2023, Argo Group completed the sale of its Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 business to Ohio
Farmers.
On February 3, 2023, Party E submitted a revised, non-binding proposal to Argo Group, pursuant to
which Party E indicated it was not interested in submitting a whole company acquisition proposal for Argo
Group at that time, but proposed acquiring two business lines of Argo Group. Party E’s proposal letter stated
that it was also willing to pursue either of those transactions on a stand alone basis. Argo Group did not
engage with Party E regarding its revised, non-binding proposal.
Later on February 3, 2023, Brookfield Reinsurance, following further due diligence regarding Argo
Group, communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs an updated proposal to acquire Argo Group for
$29.00 per common share in cash (conditioned on the suspension of quarterly dividends for Argo Group’s
common shares between signing and closing of a potential transaction). During the same discussion,
Brookfield Reinsurance increased its offer price to $30.00 per common share in cash (conditioned on the
suspension of quarterly dividends for Argo Group’s common shares between signing and closing of a
potential transaction), but indicated that it was not willing to increase its offer price further.
Following the discussions between representatives of Brookfield Reinsurance and Goldman Sachs on
February 3, 2023, representatives of Debevoise sent a revised draft of the merger agreement and related
transaction documents to representatives of Skadden.
On February 4, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the revised proposal of
$30.00 per common share in cash received from Brookfield Reinsurance and the remaining open issues with
respect to the merger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents, including with respect
to the merger agreement (i) the matters that would constitute a burdensome condition that would excuse
Brookfield Reinsurance from consummating the proposed transaction and (ii) the scope of certain covenants
related to (A) the capital position of Argonaut Insurance Company (“AIC”), a subsidiary of Argo Group, and
(B) treatment of Argo Group’s Brazil license, and, with respect to the voting agreement (i) the duration of
transfer restrictions applicable to the covered shares, (ii) the scope of Argo Group’s obligation with respect
to the timing of filing this proxy statement and holding the special general meeting and (iii) the amount of
Voce’s out-of-pocket expense reimbursement. Argo Group’s board of directors determined to continue
negotiating exclusively with Brookfield Reinsurance to resolve the remaining open points with respect to the
merger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents before responding to the updated
offer price of $30.00 per common share proposed by Brookfield Reinsurance. At the meeting, the board of
directors also discussed the updated proposal received from Party E on February 3, 2023, but determined not
to engage further with Party E since Party E had indicated that they were not interested in a whole company
acquisition of Argo Group.
Between February 4, 2023 and February 6, 2023, representatives of Debevoise and Skadden exchanged
drafts of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.
On February 6, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the remaining issues

respect to the merger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents, including with respect
to the merger agreement (i) the matters that would constitute a burdensome condition that would excuse
Brookfield Reinsurance from consummating the proposed transaction and (ii) the scope of certain covenants
related to (A) tax matters, (B) AIC’s capital position and (C) treatment of Argo Group’s Brazil license, and,
with respect to the voting agreement (i) the duration of transfer restrictions applicable to the covered shares,
(ii) the scope of Argo Group’s obligation with respect to the timing of filing this proxy statement and holding
the special general meeting and (iii) the amount of Voce’s out-of-pocket expense reimbursement. At the
meeting, Argo Group’s board of directors determined to delegate authority to the strategic review committee
to engage in further negotiations with Brookfield Reinsurance regarding its per common share offer price.
On February 6, 2023, the strategic review committee instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to
inform Brookfield Reinsurance that Argo Group would be willing to accept Brookfield Reinsurance’s revised
offer price of $30.00 per common share, subject to resolution of the other open points with respect to the
merger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents.
On February 7, 2023, representatives of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance, Skadden and Debevoise
engaged in discussions to resolve the remaining open points with respect to the merger agreement relating
to (i) the matters that would constitute a burdensome condition that would excuse Brookfield Reinsurance
from consummating the proposed transaction and (ii) the scope of certain covenants related to (A) tax
matters and (B) AIC’s capital position. Representatives of Voce, Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance also
had a call to resolve the remaining open points with respect to the voting agreement regarding (i) the
duration of transfer restrictions applicable to the covered shares, (ii) the scope of Argo Group’s obligation
with respect to the timing of filing this proxy statement and holding the special general meeting and (iii) the
amount of Voce’s out-of-pocket expense reimbursement. The parties also exchanged drafts of the transaction
documents during the course of the day.
On February 8, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group’s
management, Goldman Sachs, Skadden and ASW in attendance. Representatives of Skadden and ASW
discussed with the Argo Group board of directors the legal principles and standards applicable to its
consideration of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Skadden also reviewed the terms and
conditions set forth in the proposed merger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents,
including, among other things, the parties’ respective termination rights (including Argo Group’s right to
terminate the merger agreement if Argo Group’s board of directors in the exercise of the directors’ fiduciary
duties, changes its recommendation with respect to the proposed transaction), the termination fee payable in
connection with certain termination events under the proposed merger agreement, the obligations of the
parties to obtain applicable regulatory approvals, the definition of a “material adverse effect,” the applicable
closing conditions and the treatment of Argo Group’s outstanding preferred shares. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs then joined the meeting and reviewed with the Argo Group board of directors Goldman
Sachs’ financial analyses of the merger consideration, as more fully described below under the heading “-
Opinion of Argo Group’s Financial Advisor”. Thereafter, at the request of the Argo Group board of
directors, representatives of Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Argo Group board of directors
(which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion dated the same
date) that, as of February 8, 2023 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth
therein, the $30.00 in cash per common share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance
and its affiliates) of Argo Group common shares pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to such holders of Argo Group common shares. After discussion, and in light of the Argo
Group’s board of directors’ review and consideration of the factors described under “- Argo Group’s
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Argo Group Board of Directors,” the Argo Group board of
directors unanimously (i) approved the merger, the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement, (ii)
determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory merger are in the best interests of Argo
Group, (iii) declared the advisability of the merger agreement, the statutory merger agreement and the merger
and (iv) resolved to recommend approval of the merger, the merger agreement and the statutory merger
agreement to Argo Group’s shareholders (subject to the right of the Argo Group board of directors to
withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation or terminate the merger agreement in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement).
Following the conclusion of the meeting of the Argo Group board of directors on February 8, 2023, Argo
Group and Brookfield Reinsurance entered into the merger agreement and issued a joint press release

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
prior to the opening of trading markets announcing the transaction. In addition, Argo Group, Voce and
Brookfield Reinsurance entered into the voting agreement.
On February 13, 2023, Mr. Plants informed Argo Group that he intended to step down from the Argo
Group board of directors, effective immediately.
On February 15, 2023, following Mr. Plants’ resignation for the board of directors, the Argo Group board
of directors determined to reduce the size of the board of directors from seven directors to six directors. The
Argo Group board of directors also determined to dissolve the strategic review committee in light of the fact
that the merger agreement had been executed.
Argo Group’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Argo Group Board of Directors
The Argo Group board of directors unanimously (1) approved the merger agreement, the statutory
merger agreement and the merger, (2) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory
merger are in the best interests of Argo Group, (3) declared the advisability of the merger agreement, the
statutory merger agreement and the merger and (4) resolved to recommend approval of the merger, the merger
agreement and the statutory merger agreement to Argo Group’s shareholders (subject to the right of the
Argo Group board of directors to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation or terminate the merger
agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement).
For purposes of Section 106(2)(b)(i) of the Companies Act, the Argo Group board of directors
determined that the fair value for (i) each common share to be $30.00, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes and (ii) each preferred share (and the related depositary shares) to be the continuation of
each such preferred share as a preferred share of Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger
with all of its relative rights, terms and conditions remaining unchanged. In accordance with Section 106(2)
(b)(ii) of the Companies Act, a dissenting shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair value of its shares.
Positive Factors Relating to the Merger
As described in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Background of the Merger” the
Argo Group board of directors, prior to and in reaching its determination at its meeting on February 8, 2023
that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement are in the best interests of Argo
Group, consulted with the strategic review committee, Argo Group’s management, financial advisors and
outside legal counsel and considered a variety of potentially positive factors relating to the merger,
including, but not limited to, the following:
Treatment of Common Shares
The value to be received by the holders of common shares in the merger, including the fact that the
cash consideration to be received represents a significant premium relative to the trading price of the
common shares. The merger consideration of $30.00 per common share represented a premium of
approximately 48.7% to the closing price of common shares on September 7, 2022, the last full trading
day prior to Argo Group announcing the sale of Argo Underwriting Agency Limited and its Lloyd’s
Syndicate 1200 and the continuation of its strategic alternatives review process, and a premium of
6.7% to the closing price of common shares on February 7, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the
announcement of the transaction.
The fact that the merger consideration of $30.00 per common share is 0.90x Argo Group’s fully diluted
book value per share and 1.02x Argo Group’s tangible book value per share, in each case for the third
quarter of fiscal year 2022.
The fact that Argo Group engaged in an extensive, publicly announced review of strategic
alternatives during the nine month period between April 2022 and the time of entry into the merger
agreement with Brookfield Reinsurance, which included outreach to over 80 interested parties,
executing confidentiality agreements with 27 of such parties and engaging in significant discussions
and receiving proposals from six of such parties, and that at the conclusion of such process no other
party had expressed a

On February 13, 2023, Mr. Plants informed Argo Group that he intended to step down from the Argo
Group board of directors, effective immediately.
On February 15, 2023, following Mr. Plants’ resignation for the board of directors, the Argo Group board
of directors determined to reduce the size of the board of directors from seven directors to six directors. The
Argo Group board of directors also determined to dissolve the strategic review committee in light of the fact

For purposes of Section 106(2)(b)(i) of the Companies Act, the Argo Group board of directors
determined that the fair value for (i) each common share to be $30.00, without interest and less any applicable

Positive Factors Relating to the Merger
As described in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Background of the Merger” the
Argo Group board of directors, prior to and in reaching its determination at its meeting on February 8, 2023
that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement are in the best interests of Argo

including, but not limited to, the following:
Treatment of Common Shares
The value to be received by the holders of common shares in the merger, including the fact that the
cash consideration to be received represents a significant premium relative to the trading price of the
common shares. The merger consideration of $30.00 per common share represented a premium of
approximately 48.7% to the closing price of common shares on September 7, 2022, the last full trading
day prior to Argo Group announcing the sale of Argo Underwriting Agency Limited and its Lloyd’s
Syndicate 1200 and the continuation of its strategic alternatives review process, and a premium of
6.7% to the closing price of common shares on February 7, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the
announcement of the transaction.
The fact that the merger consideration of $30.00 per common share is 0.90x Argo Group’s fully diluted
book value per share and 1.02x Argo Group’s tangible book value per share, in each case for the third
quarter of fiscal year 2022.
The fact that Argo Group engaged in an extensive, publicly announced review of strategic
alternatives during the nine month period between April 2022 and the time of entry into the merger
agreement with Brookfield Reinsurance, which included outreach to over 80 interested parties,
executing confidentiality agreements with 27 of such parties and engaging in significant discussions
and receiving proposals from six of such parties, and that at the conclusion of such process no other
party had expressed a

TABLE OF CONTENTS
willingness to make an offer in excess of the $30.00 per common share Brookfield Reinsurance has
agreed to pay as described in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Background of
the Merger.”
The belief of the Argo Group board of directors that, as a result of the negotiations between the
parties, the merger consideration of $30.00 per share was the highest price per share for the common
shares that Brookfield Reinsurance was willing to pay at the time of those negotiations and following
completion of its due diligence.
The possibility that, if Argo Group did not enter into the merger agreement, it could take a
considerable amount of time and involve a substantial amount of risk before the trading price of the
common shares would reach and sustain the $30.00 per share value of the merger consideration, as
adjusted for present value.
The likelihood, based on the extensive strategic review process conducted by Argo Group, that there
would be no other parties that would be willing to make an offer in excess of Brookfield Reinsurance’s
offer of $30.00 per common share if Argo Group did not enter into the merger agreement.
The fact that the merger consideration is to be paid entirely in cash, which will allow holders of
common shares to realize, upon closing, a certainty of value in light of the risks and uncertainties
inherent in Argo Group’s prospects and the market, economic and other risks that arise from owning
an equity interest in a public company.
The Argo Group board of directors’ understanding of the Argo Group’s business, operations,
financial condition, earnings, prospects, competitive position and the nature of the industry in which
the Argo Group competes, including the short and long term risks, uncertainties and challenges
facing the Argo Group and such industry;
The financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Argo Group board of directors by
representatives of Goldman Sachs as well as the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the Argo Group board
of directors on February 8, 2023 that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various
assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the $30.00 in cash per
common share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of Argo
Group common shares pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such
holders of Argo Group common shares.
Treatment of Preferred Shares
The fact that holders of preferred shares will continue to own preferred shares of Argo Group as the
surviving company following the merger and that the relative rights, terms and conditions of each
such preferred share will remain unchanged.
Terms of the Merger Agreement
The fact that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including, but not limited to, the
representations, warranties and covenants of the parties and the conditions to closing, are
reasonable.
The belief of the Argo Group board of directors that the conditions to the consummation of the
merger as set forth in the merger agreement are reasonable and customary, and the likelihood in the
view of the Argo Group board of directors that the merger would be completed because of the limited
nature of such conditions.
The availability of appraisal rights to Argo Group shareholders who do not vote in favor of the merger
proposal and who are not satisfied they have been offered fair value for their shares, which rights
provide eligible shareholders with the opportunity to have the Bermuda Court appraise the fair value
of their shares.
The fact that the Argo Group board of directors is permitted to modify or withdraw its
recommendation of the merger proposal in response to a material event or circumstance that was not
known to, or was not reasonably foreseeable by, the Argo Group board of directors on February 8,
2023 if the Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial

advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to the payment of a $37,183,000 termination
fee if Brookfield Reinsurance terminates the merger agreement (see the section of this proxy statement
titled “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; Adverse Recommendation
Change; Alternative Acquisition Agreement”).
Other specific terms of the merger agreement permitting Argo Group to consider a “superior proposal”
received after the date of the merger agreement and at any time prior to approval of the merger
proposal by Argo Group’s shareholders, including:
Argo Group’s ability, under certain circumstances, to consider and respond to an unsolicited
bona fide proposal or engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party making such a
proposal, in each case if the Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such “takeover proposal”
either constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a “superior proposal”  (see the
section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Takeover
Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change; Alternative Acquisition Agreements”);
The fact that the terms of the merger agreement provide that, under certain circumstances where
a takeover proposal has been received, Argo Group is permitted to entertain such takeover
proposal, and the Argo Group board of directors is permitted to:
modify or withdraw its recommendation of the merger proposal in response to a superior
proposal if the Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to the
payment of a $37,183,000 termination fee if Brookfield Reinsurance terminates the merger
agreement; or
subject to the procedures set forth in the merger agreement, terminate the merger agreement
to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement in respect of a superior proposal if the
Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to the payment of a
$37,183,000 termination fee (see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement - No Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change;
Alternative Acquisition Agreements”).
Argo Group’s ability to waive any standstill provision to allow a third party to make an
alternative acquisition proposal to the Argo Group board of directors on a non-public basis if the
Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Argo Group’s
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
The belief of Argo Group’s board of directors, based on consultation with Argo Group’s financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the $37,183,000 termination fee, which is approximately
3.5% of the estimated aggregate merger consideration payable in connection with the merger,
would not preclude other parties from making an acquisition proposal for Argo Group.
The absence of any financing condition or contingency for Brookfield Reinsurance to consummate
the merger and pay the merger consideration.
The fact that Voce, one of Argo Group’s largest shareholders holding approximately 9.5% of the
outstanding common shares, entered into a voting agreement, pursuant to which, among other
things, Voce agreed to vote all of its common shares owned as of the record date in favor of the
merger proposal during the term of the voting agreement.
The fact that Brookfield Reinsurance is a strong, well-capitalized company with ample resources to
consummate the transaction.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The high likelihood that Brookfield Reinsurance will proceed to consummate the merger without
significant delay, given its regulatory sophistication, track record of obtaining regulatory approvals
in similar transactions, financial resources and high credit rating.
Brookfield Reinsurance’s commitment in the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the merger (subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement).
Risk and Other Considerations of the Merger
In the course of its deliberations, the Argo Group board of directors, in consultation with the strategic
review committee, Argo Group’s management, financial advisors and outside legal counsel, also considered a
variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the merger, including the following:
The possibility that the merger might not be consummated, or that the consummation might be
delayed.
The risk of diverting management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and
operational matters while implementing the merger.
That restrictions on the conduct of Argo Group’s business prior to consummation of the merger could
delay or prevent Argo Group from undertaking business opportunities that arise pending
consummation of the merger, which opportunities might be lost to Argo Group if the merger is not
consummated.
The potential negative effect of the pendency of the merger on Argo Group’s business and
relationships with customers, vendors, business partners and employees, including the risk that key
employees might not choose to remain employed with Argo Group prior to the consummation of the
merger, regardless of whether or not the merger is consummated.
The risk that Argo Group shareholders may not approve the merger proposal.
The risk that governmental entities may oppose or refuse to approve the merger or impose conditions
on Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance (or Brookfield or any of their respective affiliates) prior to
approving the merger, which conditions may constitute a burdensome condition under the terms of
the merger agreement that would excuse Brookfield Reinsurance from consummating the merger.
The fact that the all-cash merger consideration, while providing certainty of value upon
consummation, would not allow holders of common shares to participate in any future earnings
growth of Argo Group or benefit from any future increase in its value.
The fact that the merger agreement prohibits Argo Group from continuing to declare and pay regular
quarterly cash dividends on the common shares.
The risk that legal proceedings could be initiated against Argo Group in connection with the merger.
The fact that some of Argo Group’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to their interests as shareholders of Argo Group (see the section
of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Interests of Argo Group’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” for a more detailed discussion of these interests).
The specific terms of the merger agreement that either individually or in combination, could
discourage potential acquirors from making a competing bid to acquire Argo Group, including:
The terms of the merger agreement placing certain limitations on the ability of Argo Group to
solicit, encourage, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate the submission of any
inquiry or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a takeover proposal or engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish any material non-public information for the purposes of facilitating, a
takeover proposal; and
The fact that Argo Group will be required to pay Brookfield Reinsurance a termination fee in
connection with the merger if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, or
which may become payable following a termination of the merger agreement in circumstances

where no alternative transaction or superior proposal is ultimately consummated (which
termination fee the Argo Group board of directors determined was reasonable and customary).
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Argo Group board of directors is not
intended to be exhaustive, but rather a summary of the material factors considered by the Argo Group board
of directors. In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, including the merger and other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Argo Group board of directors did not quantify or
assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different
weights to different factors. The Argo Group board of directors considered the various factors as a whole,
including discussions with, and questioning of, the strategic review committee, Argo Group’s management,
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to
support, its determination.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Argo Group board of
directors is forward-looking in nature. This information should be read in light of the factors described under
the section of this proxy statement titled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking
Information.”
Opinion of Argo Group’s Financial Advisor
Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to Argo Group’s board of directors that, as of February 8, 2023 and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $30.00 in cash per common
share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of common shares
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of common shares.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 8, 2023, which sets forth assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the
opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and
assistance of Argo Group’s board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. Goldman Sachs’
opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of common shares should vote with respect to the merger or any
other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,
Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:
the merger agreement;
annual reports to shareholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K and 10-K/A of Argo Group for the
five years ended December 31, 2021;
certain interim reports to shareholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Argo Group;
certain other communications from Argo Group to its shareholders;
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Argo Group; and
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Argo Group prepared by its management, as
approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Argo Group, including the financial projections (as defined and
more fully described in the section of this proxy statement titled “Certain Argo Group Prospective
Financial Information”).
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Argo Group regarding
their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition, and future prospects of
Argo Group; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the common shares; compared certain
financial and stock market information for Argo Group with similar information for certain other companies
the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations in the insurance industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered
such other factors, including Sections 2.06 and 6.01(a)(i) of the merger agreement, as Goldman Sachs deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with Argo Group’s consent, relied upon and
assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other
information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for
independent
37 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with Argo Group’s consent that the financial
projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of Argo Group. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets
and liabilities) of Argo Group or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or
appraisal. Goldman Sachs is not an actuary and Goldman Sachs’ services did not include any actuarial
determination or evaluation by Goldman Sachs or any attempt to evaluate actuarial assumptions and
Goldman Sachs relied on Argo Group’s actuaries with respect to reserve adequacy. In that regard, Goldman
Sachs made no analysis of, and expressed no opinion as to, the adequacy of the loss and loss adjustments
expenses reserves of Argo Group. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other
consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse
effect on the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also
assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the
waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its
analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Argo Group to engage in
the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available
to Argo Group; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $30.00 in cash
per common share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of common
shares pursuant to the Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not
address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other
agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection
with the merger, including the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection
therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Argo Group;
nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of Argo Group, or class of such persons in connection with the merger,
whether relative to the $30.00 in cash per common share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield
Reinsurance and its affiliates) of common shares pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other condition as in effect on, and
the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumes
no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or
events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to
the prices at which the common shares will trade at any time or, as to the potential effects of volatility in the
credit, financial and stock markets on Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance or the merger, or as to the impact
of the merger on the solvency or viability of Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or the ability of Argo
Group or Brookfield Reinsurance to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’
opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the board
of directors of Argo Group in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following
summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by
Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to
those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone
not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. In connection with its opinion, Goldman
Sachs considered, among other things, Sections 2.06 and 6.01(a)(i) of the merger agreement, pursuant to
which Argo Group is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on the common shares at any time
from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the closing of the merger and the termination of the
merger agreement. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is
based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 6, 2023, and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Analysis of Implied Premiums
Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices for the common shares for the one-year period
ending February 6, 2023. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of
common shares pursuant to the merger agreement in relation to:

Illustrative Dividend Discount Analysis
Using the financial projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative dividend discount analysis on
Argo Group to derive a range of illustrative values per common share for Argo Group’s fully diluted common
shares. Goldman Sachs discounted the estimated capital return to shareholders (in the form of dividend
streams and share repurchases, adjusting for stock based compensation, as reflected in the financial
projections) from Argo Group for the period of the fourth quarter of 2022 through 2026, as reflected in the
financial projections, and the range of terminal values to derive present values, as of September 30, 2022, for
Argo Group. Goldman Sachs calculated a range of terminal values for Argo Group by applying P/BV multiples
ranging from 0.60x to 1.10x to the projected book value per common share including accumulated other
comprehensive income (which we refer to as the “AOCI”) of Argo Group in 2026 as reflected in the financial
projections. These illustrative P/BV multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its
professional judgment and experience, taking into account, among other things, the current and historical
observed P/BV multiples for Argo Group. Goldman Sachs used a range of discount rates from 8.50% to
10.25%, reflecting estimates of Argo Group’s cost of equity. Utilizing its professional judgment and
experience, Goldman Sachs derived such estimated cost of equity by application of the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (which we refer to as “CAPM”), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for
Argo Group, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This
analysis implied a value of $25.08 to $43.79 per common share as of September 30, 2022 (based on the implied
total number of fully diluted

common shares estimated to be outstanding as of February 3, 2023, of approximately 35.161 million shares, as
provided by Argo Group’s management).
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Using the financial projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present
value of an illustrative future value per common share. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated and
implied a range of theoretical future values per common share as of December 31, 2023 through December 31,
2025, by applying illustrative P/BV multiples ranging from 0.60x to 1.10x to Argo Group’s projected book
value per common share (including AOCI) as of December 31 of each such year included in the financial
projections. These illustrative multiples were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment
and experience, taking into account current and historical P/BV multiples for Argo Group. Goldman Sachs
then discounted to present value as of September 30, 2022 both the theoretical range of future values per
common share it derived for Argo Group (which ranged from $21.27 to $51.44 per common share) and the
estimated dividends to be paid per common share through the end of the applicable period as reflected in the
financial projections using a discount rate of 9.25%, reflecting an estimate of Argo Group’s cost of equity.
Utilizing its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs derived such estimated cost of equity by
application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Argo Group,
as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in
a range of implied present values of $20.52 to $42.10 per common share.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following eight selected transactions in the
insurance industry since 2013. For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and
compared the equity value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in the
transaction as a multiple of the target company’s book value (including AOCI) as reported or calculated
using publicly available information for the most recent financial period reporting date prior to the
announcement (which we refer to as the “P/BV multiples”) of the applicable transaction. While none of the
companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to Argo Group, the
companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes
of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Argo Group’s results, market sizes and product profile.

Based on the results of the foregoing P/BV multiples and Goldman Sachs’ professional judgment and
experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of price to book value (including AOCI) multiples of

multiples calculated for the transactions above) to (i) Argo Group’s book value (including AOCI) per

Group’s management) for the period ending September 30, 2022 of $33.72 per common share to derive a range
of implied values per common share of $17.48 to $58.79 and (ii) Argo Group’s estimated book value (including
AOCI) per common share (based on the fully diluted common shares outstanding as of February 3, 2023, as

values per common share of $16.10 to $54.12.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,
without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying
Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all
of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or the
contemplated transaction.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to Argo
Group’s board of directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the holders (other than
Brookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of common shares of the $30.00 in cash per common share to be
paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor
do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based
upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the
parties or their respective advisors, none of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance, Goldman Sachs or any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Argo Group and
Brookfield Reinsurance and was approved by Argo Group’s board of directors. Goldman Sachs provided
advice to Argo Group during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific
amount of consideration to Argo Group or its board of directors or that any specific amount of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to Argo Group’s board of directors was one of many
factors taken into consideration by Argo Group’s board of directors in making its determination to approve
the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending and financing, principal
investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial
activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and

Argo Group management does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future
performance or earnings and is especially cautious of making projections due to the significant
unpredictability inherent in its businesses. However, certain financial projections were prepared by Argo
Group’s management and provided to and approved for use by, Goldman Sachs, a financial advisor to the
Argo Group board of directors, in connection with its evaluation of the merger (which we refer to as the
“financial projections”). The financial projections were not developed for the purposes of providing earnings
guidance. In addition, Argo Group provided the financial projections to certain interested parties in
connection with their evaluation of a potential transaction with Argo Group, including Brookfield
Reinsurance.
The financial projections each represent only one scenario in a wide range of potential outcomes. While
presented with numeric specificity, the financial projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions
with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial
conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to Argo Group’s business, all of which are
inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Argo Group’s control. The
financial projections are subjective in many respects and thus are susceptible to multiple interpretations and
periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The financial projections may
also be affected by Argo Group’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the
applicable periods. As such, the financial projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject
to risks and uncertainties,
42 TABLE OF CONTENTS
including the various risks set forth in the sections of this proxy statement titled “Cautionary Statements
Concerning Forward-Looking Information” and in Argo Group’s most recent reports on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and
other documents of Argo Group on file with or furnished to the SEC. Argo Group shareholders should read
such sections of this proxy statement and such reports filed with the SEC for additional information
regarding the risks inherent in forward-looking information such as the financial projections. The financial
projections cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each
successive year.
The financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, the published
guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information, but, in
view of Argo Group’s management, were prepared on a reasonable basis. However, this information is not
fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy
statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial projections. Argo Group’s
independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, KPMG LLP, has
not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the financial
projections included below and, accordingly, KPMG LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of
assurance with respect thereto. The KPMG LLP report, incorporated by reference in Item 15 of Argo Group’s
most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, relates to Argo
Group’s previously issued financial statements and does not extend to the prospective financial information
and should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the financial projections do not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared.
Certain of the financial projections set forth herein were not prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as “non-GAAP”) financial measures. Non-GAAP financial
measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in
compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as “GAAP”), and non-GAAP
financial measures as used in the financial projections may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts
used by other companies or persons. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from
the definition of non-GAAP financial measures and therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding
disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP
financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Accordingly, Argo Group has not provided a reconciliation
of the financial measures included in the financial projections which have been provided to Goldman Sachs
for purposes of preparing its financial analyses and opinions.
The information about the financial projections set forth below do not give effect to the merger and
none of the financial projections take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be consummated.
You are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on the financial projections set forth below. The
inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that
any of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance or their affiliates, advisors or representatives considered or
consider the financial projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the financial projections
should not be relied upon as such. None of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance or their respective affiliates,
advisors or representatives can give any assurance that actual results will not materially differ from the
financial projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile
the financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date such financial projections were
generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions
underlying the financial projections are shown to be in error. None of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance or
their respective affiliates, advisors or representatives makes any representation to any other person
regarding the financial projections. The financial projections are not being included in this proxy statement
to influence a shareholder’s decision regarding how to vote on any given proposal, but because the financial
projections were provided to Goldman Sachs, and, at the direction of Argo Group, used by Goldman Sachs in
its financial analysis, they are accordingly disclosed in this proxy statement. The financial projections are for
illustrative purposes and should not be considered an indication of what Argo Group may do in the future.

The closing is expected to take place in the second half of 2023, although there can be no assurance
that the parties will be able to do so. The closing will occur on the fourth business day following the
satisfaction or waiver of all the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement (described in the section
of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Closing; Effective Time”) (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions) or such other date and time as Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance may agree in

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits
described in this section, the following assumptions, as well as those described in the footnotes to the
tables set forth below and in the section of this proxy statement titled “Merger-Related Compensation for
Argo Group Named Executive Officers, were used:
The effective time is July 31, 2023, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for
purposes of the disclosure in this section (which we refer to as the “assumed effective time”), and the
date that the effective time actually occurs will likely be different than the assumed effective time;
The relevant price per share of Argo Group common stock is $30.00, which is the amount that each
holder of common shares of Argo Group will be entitled to receive with respect to each such common
share;
The completion of the merger constitutes a change in control, change in control or term of similar
meaning for purposes of all Argo Group plans and agreements described below;
Each executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment (i.e., a termination of
employment without “cause” or a resignation for “good reason”, as such terms are defined in the
relevant plans and agreements) at or immediately following the assumed effective time; and
No director or executive officer receives any additional equity grants or other awards on or prior to
the assumed effective time.
As the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur or be accurate as of the date referenced, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or
become payable may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
Treatment of Outstanding Argo Group Restricted Share Awards
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each Argo Group
restricted share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will (i) become fully vested,
in the case of a time-based vesting Argo Group restricted share, or become vested at an assumed level of
performance, in the case of a performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share, based on the
following: (a) if the effective time occurs prior to half-way through the applicable performance period, then
the number of Argo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo Group
restricted share shall be based on the applicable performance goals being deemed to have been satisfied at
the target level and (b) if the effective time occurs on or after half-way through the applicable performance
period, then the number of Argo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo
Group restricted share shall be based on the projected actual level of performance through the end of the
applicable performance period, as determined by the Argo Group board of directors in accordance with the
terms of Argo Group share plans prior to the date of the effective time taking into account performance
through the date of such determination (but, if the Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith
that the projected actual level of performance is not reasonably determinable, the number of Argo Group
common shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share will be based on
the target level), and (ii) be canceled and converted into solely the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the sum of (x) the merger consideration of $30.00 and (y) the value of any
dividends accrued in respect of such Argo Group restricted share that remain unpaid as of immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger, less any required withholding taxes.
Treatment of Outstanding Argo Group Cash Awards
Each award under any Argo Group share plan that is denominated in cash and was granted prior to
January 1, 2023 (each, an “Argo Group cash award”) and is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will not vest upon the effective time, and instead will continue following the effective time
of the merger in accordance with the terms in effect for such Argo Group cash award. If Argo Group
terminates the Argo Group cash award holder’s employment without cause (as defined in the 2019 Omnibus
Incentive Plan) or, if applicable, such holder resigns for good reason (as defined in the holder’s employment

TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreement or in a severance plan in which the holder is eligible to participate) within 24 months following the
effective time of the merger, such Argo Group cash award will vest and be settled following the holder’s
termination of employment.
Treatment of Outstanding Argo Group SAR Awards
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share
appreciation right in respect of Argo Group each Argo Group SAR outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, will be deemed to be fully vested and will be
canceled and converted into solely the right to receive a lump-sum amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any of (a) the merger consideration of $30.00, over (b) the per share exercise
price of such Argo Group SAR, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Argo Group common shares subject to
such Argo Group SAR immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, less any required withholding
taxes.
Value to Executive Officers in Respect of Argo Group Awards
Based on the assumptions described above under “- Certain Assumptions,” and those described in the
footnotes to the table below, the table below sets forth the number of Argo Group restricted shares, Argo
Group cash awards and Argo Group SARs (collectively, the “Argo Group awards”) held by Argo Group
executive officers as of the date of this proxy statement, and the value that the executive officers can expect
to receive for such unvested Argo Group awards at the assumed effective time based on the per share merger
consideration of $30.00 (in the case of unvested Argo Group restricted shares and Argo Group SARs).
Depending on when the merger is completed, certain Argo Group awards that are now unvested and included
in the table below may vest or be forfeited pursuant to their terms, independent of the merger.

Messrs. Rehnberg and Borst no longer hold outstanding Argo Group awards.
The amounts in this column include both time-vesting and performance-vesting Argo Group restricted
shares. Based on an assumed effective time that occurs on or after half-way through the applicable
performance period in respect of the performance-vesting Argo Group restricted shares, the number of
performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted shares included in this column is based on an
assumed projected actual level of performance for the open performance periods as of the assumed
effective time, as summarized below:
(i) Three-year average Return on Common Equity (“ROCE”) at 21%; and
(ii) Three-year compound annual growth rate of Tangible Book Value Per Share (“TBVPS”) at 0%.
The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate value of each executive officer’s outstanding Argo
Group restricted shares as of the assumed effective time, which is equal to the product obtained by
multiplying the number of such restricted shares by the merger consideration of $30.00. For purposes of
the values reported in this column, dividends which have been accrued and unpaid in respect of the
outstanding Argo Group restricted shares as of immediately prior to the assumed effective time have not
been included.
The $43.80 exercise price of the Argo Group SARs is in excess of the merger consideration, so such
Argo Group SARs will be cancelled for no consideration at the assumed effective time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Value to Directors in Respect of Argo Group Awards
As of the date of this proxy statement, each current non-employee director of Argo Group holds 2,266
Argo Group restricted shares that are scheduled to vest on May 5, 2023. Based on the per share merger
consideration of $30.00, the value of the restricted shares held by each director is $67,980. Messrs. Latham,
Donner and Plants no longer hold outstanding Argo Group restricted shares. Pursuant to the Argo Group
director compensation program, Argo Group may grant its annual equity awards with a grant date fair value
of $95,000 to Argo Group’s non-employee directors in May of 2023 and pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, this award will be granted in cash in lieu of equity. Depending on when the merger is completed,
this cash award may vest or be forfeited pursuant to their terms in accordance with the Argo Group director
compensation program, independent of the merger.
Strategic Review Committee Compensation
Except for Mr. Bradley, each of Messrs. Bailey, Donner and Plants and Ms. Lehane received
compensation in the amount of $1,000 for his or her attendance at each formal meeting of the strategic review
committee and reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with his or her service on the
strategic review committee. From the date of the strategic review committee’s formation on June 1, 2022 to its
dissolution on February 15, 2023, the strategic review committee convened for formal meetings 13 times.
Messrs. Bradley and Bailey and Ms. Lehane were present for each of these meetings. Mr. Donner was
present for each of these meetings, except for the last formal meeting of the strategic review committee,
which took place on December 12, 2022, immediately prior to his resignation from the board of directors of
Argo Group on December 15, 2022, for a total of 12 meetings. Mr. Plants was present for each formal meeting
of the strategic review committee from the date of his appointment to the strategic review committee on
August 4, 2022 for a total of 9 meetings.
Treatment of Purchase Rights under the ESPP
Mses. Comparato, Kiene and Snyder, together with other eligible employees, participate in the ESPP,
pursuant to which Argo Group common shares may be purchased, up to a maximum of $25,000 per calendar
year offering, at a price per share that is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of an Argo Group common
share on the first day of the applicable offering period or the last day of the applicable offering period.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, prior to the effective time of the merger, (i) the final purchase
period under the ESPP will be terminated no later than four business days prior to the date on which the
effective time of the merger occurs; (ii) any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the final
purchase period will be made, but the final purchase period will otherwise be treated as a fully effective and
completed purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; and (iii) the exercise (as of no later than
four business days prior to the date on which the effective time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right
pursuant to the ESPP will occur. The executive officers that currently participate in the ESPP will not be
permitted to increase the percentage of their payroll deduction elections from those in effect as of February
8, 2023, and no additional executive officers will be permitted to commence participation in the ESPP from and
after February 8, 2023.
Annual Bonus
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, in respect of Argo Group’s calendar year in which the
effective time occurs, each Argo Group executive officer who is employed as of immediately prior to the
effective time (except for Mr. Bradley) will be eligible to receive an annual bonus in the normal course,
subject to the executive officer’s continued employment through the regularly scheduled payment date. Each
such executive officer also will be eligible to receive an annual bonus for Argo Group’s calendar year in
which the effective time occurs in an amount no less than the amount equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the executive officer’s full bonus entitlement for Argo Group’s calendar year in which the
effective time occurs, based on the actual level of performance as determined by the Argo Group board of
directors prior to the closing, taking into account performance through the date of such determination, by (ii)
a fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of days that have elapsed from January 1 of such
calendar year in which the effective time occurs through the closing and the denominator of which equals
365. The target
48

TABLE OF CONTENTS
annual bonus for calendar year 2023 for each executive officer (except for Mr. Bradley) is as follows: $700,000
for Mr. Kirk, $375,000 for Ms. Comparato, $525,000 for Ms. Kiene and $700,000 for Ms. Snyder.
CEO Transaction Bonus
Argo Group and Mr. Bradley entered into a transaction bonus agreement on March 3, 2023, pursuant to
which Mr. Bradley is eligible to receive a cash bonus opportunity of $1.2 million (which we refer to as the
“transaction bonus”), subject to his continued employment through the effective time of the merger and
contingent upon the consummation of the merger. The transaction bonus will be paid no later than the
second payroll date following the effective time of the merger, subject to the foregoing conditions.
Potential Severance Payments Upon a Qualifying Termination Following the Effective Time - ESP
Argo Group maintains the Executive Severance Plan (which we refer to as the “ESP”). Each current
executive officer is eligible to participate in the ESP, except for Mr. Bradley. The ESP provides that, in the
event that within 24 months following a change in control (as defined in the ESP), (i) the executive officer’s
employment is terminated without “cause”  (as defined in the ESP) or (ii) the executive officer resigns with
“good reason”  (as defined in the ESP), then the executive officer will be entitled to the following severance
payments and benefits, subject to the executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims,
and continued compliance with applicable restrictive covenants (as described below):
A cash amount equal to 1.50 times the sum of the executive officer’s (i) annual base salary and (ii)
target annual bonus;
an amount equal to the executive officer’s target annual bonus, pro-rated through the date of
employment termination;
for U.S. executive officers only, COBRA health care continuation coverage for 18 months following a
change in control; and
reimbursement of any legal fees incurred by the executive officer in a good faith dispute to enforce
rights under the ESP, or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding regarding the imposition of
any “golden parachute” excise tax (as discussed below).
The closing of the merger will constitute a change in control for purposes of the ESP. If any payments
and benefits to be paid or provided to an executive officer, whether pursuant to the terms of the ESP or
otherwise, would be subject to “golden parachute” excise taxes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (which we refer to as the “Code”), the payments and benefits will be reduced to the extent
necessary to avoid such excise taxes, but only if such a reduction of pay or benefits would result in a greater
after-tax benefit to the executive officer. Each executive officer is subject to post-termination restrictive
covenant provisions pursuant to the terms of the ESP, including perpetual confidentiality and non-
disparagement covenants, and 18-month non-competition and employee and customer non-solicitation
covenants.
Based on the assumptions described above under “- Certain Assumptions”, the table below sets forth
the estimated value of the severance payments and benefits that the executive officers of Argo Group (except
for Mr. Bradley) would be eligible to receive under the ESP. The estimated amounts below do not attempt to
quantify any reductions in order to avoid any applicable “golden parachute” excise taxes under the Code, or
any legal fees that could be incurred by an executive officer in connection with a dispute to enforce rights
under the ESP or any tax audit or proceeding regarding the imposition of any “golden parachute” excise tax.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Messrs. Rehnberg and Borst are no longer employed with the Argo Group and not eligible for benefits
under the ESP.
The amounts shown in this column represent a pro-rated annual target bonus for the year of
termination, calculated based on each executive officer’s actual days of employment from January 1,
2023, through the assumed effective time.
2023 Long-Term Incentive Cash Awards
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the executive officers (except for Mr. Bradley) are eligible
to receive a grant of a fixed long-term cash award under the Argo Group share plans in March of 2023 in lieu
of an annual equity award that will vest in equal installments over four years, subject to the executive
officer’s continued employment through each vesting date (which we refer to as the “2023 LTI cash
awards”). The 2023 LTI cash awards will vest in full if, within 24 months following the effective time, the
executive officer’s employment is terminated without “cause”  (as defined in the ESP) or the executive officer
resigns for “good reason”  (as defined in the ESP). The award agreements for the 2023 LTI cash awards will
include certain post-termination restrictive covenant provisions, including a perpetual confidentiality
covenant, and 12‑month employee and customer non-solicitation covenants.
The amount of the 2023 LTI cash award for each executive officer (except for Mr. Bradley) is as follows:
$700,000 for Mr. Kirk, $250,000 for Ms. Comparato, $300,000 for Ms. Kiene and $700,000 for Ms. Snyder. As a
condition to receiving a 2023 LTI cash award, each executive officer will be required to execute an
acknowledgement in which the executive officer agrees that “good reason,” for purposes of all Argo Group
arrangements in which the executive officer is eligible to participate, will not be triggered by or as a result of
the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and Argo Group ceasing to be a
standalone public company or the executive officer ceasing to be an executive officer of a standalone public
company (which we refer to as the “good reason acknowledgement”). As of the date of this proxy statement,
Ms. Snyder is the only executive officer to execute the good reason acknowledgement. Mr. Kirk and Mses.
Comparato and Kiene have not executed the good reason acknowledgement and accordingly are not
currently eligible to receive a 2023 LTI cash award, but the executive officer may elect to execute the good
reason acknowledgement by no later than March 31, 2023.
Compensation Arrangements with Brookfield Reinsurance
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Argo Group’s executive officers have entered into any
definitive agreement with Brookfield Reinsurance or any of its affiliates regarding continued employment
with Brookfield Reinsurance, the surviving company or one or more of their affiliates. Prior to, or following
the effective time of the merger, however, some or all of Argo Group’s executive officers may discuss or enter
into definitive agreements (which will take effect at or after the effective time of the merger) with Brookfield
Reinsurance regarding employment with, or the right to receive compensation and benefits from, Brookfield
Reinsurance or one or more of its affiliates (including the surviving company). In addition, pursuant to the
merger agreement, as described under “The Merger Agreement - Employee Matters,” Brookfield Reinsurance
has agreed that it will provide, or will cause the surviving company to provide, during the continuation
period (as defined below), certain levels of compensation and benefits to Argo Group employees (as defined
below) who are employed by Ago Group immediately prior to the effective time.
Indemnification and Insurance
The merger agreement provides for certain indemnification arrangements for Argo Group’s current
officers and directors and the continuation of certain insurance arrangements for Argo Group’s current
officers and directors for six years after the effective time.
Merger-Related Compensation for Argo Group Named Executive Officers
The table below sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the
compensation for each named executive officer of Argo Group that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC

TABLE OF CONTENTS
disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable
to the named executive officers of Argo Group. The merger-related compensation payable to these
individuals is the subject of an advisory (non-binding) vote of Argo Group’s stockholders, as described
below in the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal 2 - Approval of the Compensation Advisory
Proposal.”
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may
not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including an assumed effective time (solely for
purposes of this disclosure) of July 31, 2023, and the other assumptions described below and above in the
section of this proxy statement titled “Interests of Argo Group’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger - Certain Assumptions,” and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation
actions that may occur before completion of the merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received
by an Argo Group named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
Accordingly, for purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
Each named executive officer of Argo Group experiences a qualifying termination of employment (i.e.,
a termination of employment without “cause” or for “good reason” as such terms are defined in the
ESP) immediately following the assumed effective time of July 31, 2023; and
No named executive officer receives any additional equity grants or other awards on or prior to the
effective time.

Although Mr. Bradley was not a “named executive officer” for purposes of the Annual Report on Form
10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed by Argo Group on April 29, 2022, he was appointed
Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) of Argo Group effective June 23, 2022, as reported in
the Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by Argo Group on June 23, 2022, and therefore is a “named
executive officer” of Argo Group as of the date of this proxy statement pursuant to the applicable SEC
disclosure rules.
Mr. Rehnberg ended his employment relationship with Argo Group effective June 23, 2022. He is no
longer eligible for additional severance benefits pursuant to his employment agreement or under the ESP
and no longer holds outstanding Argo Group awards.
Mr. Borst resigned from Argo Group effective April 1, 2022. He is no longer eligible for additional
severance benefits under the ESP and no longer holds outstanding Argo Group awards.
The amounts in this column represent the estimated cash payments set forth in the table below. The
amounts shown in the table for Mr. Kirk and Mses. Comparato and Kiene are “double-trigger” and will
not be payable unless the named executive officer’s employment is terminated by the employer without
cause or by the named executive officer for good reason within 24 months following the closing of the
merger. In addition, the receipt of such cash payments (except for Ms. Comparato’s Argo Group cash
award) is conditioned on the named executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of
claims, and continued compliance with any applicable restrictive covenants. The amount in the table for
Mr. Bradley is “single trigger” and represents the transaction bonus that he is eligible to receive,
subject to his continued employment through the effective time of the merger and contingent upon the
consummation of the merger, as discussed above in the section of this proxy statement titled “CEO
Transaction Bonus.”

The amounts in this column reflect a long-term cash award to be granted to each named executive
officer in March of 2023, subject to the named executive officer executing a good reason
acknowledgement, as discussed above in the section of this proxy statement titled “2023 Long-
Term Incentive Cash Awards.” As of the date of this proxy statement, no named executive officer
has executed the good reason acknowledgement and accordingly is not currently eligible receive a
2023 LTI cash award. However, the named executive officer may execute the good reason
acknowledgement no later than March 31, 2023, and be eligible to receive a 2023 LTI cash award in
the amounts described above. Accordingly, the amounts of the 2023 LTI cash awards are being

received by each named executive officer.
The amounts in this column represent the value of the Argo Group restricted shares held by the named
executive officers that will become fully vested (or vested at an assumed level of performance, in the
case of a performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share) and be cashed out at the assumed

The amounts in this column represent the total cost to Argo Group of the continued medical, dental and
vision benefits provided pursuant to the ESP for 18 months following the assumed effective time. The
amounts shown in this column are “double-trigger” and will not be payable unless the named executive
officer’s employment is terminated by the employer without cause or by the named executive officer for
good reason within 24 months following the closing of the merger. In addition, the receipt of such
benefits is conditioned on the named executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of

The total amounts do not reflect any reductions to “parachute payments” as defined by Code Section
280G in order to avoid any applicable excise tax thereunder, as discussed above in the section of this
proxy statement titled “Potential Severance Payments Upon a Qualifying Termination Following the
Effective Time - ESP.” A definitive analysis of the need, if any, for such reductions will depend on the
actual date of the effective time, the date of termination (if any) of the named executive officer and
certain other assumptions used in the applicable calculations",53,61

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Brookfield Reinsurance will not be obligated by a governmental
authority in connection with obtaining a required regulatory approval to take or refrain from taking or to
agree to it, its subsidiaries or Argo Group or its subsidiaries taking or refraining from taking any action
(including any amendment, waiver or termination of any agreement, including the merger agreement) or to

Merger Agreement - Efforts to Complete the Merger”).
HSR Act
Under the HSR Act, Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance cannot consummate the merger until Argo
Group and Brookfield Reinsurance have notified the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division (which we
refer to as the “Antitrust Division”) and the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) of
the merger and furnished them with certain information and materials relating to the merger and the
applicable waiting period has terminated or expired. The termination or expiration of the waiting period means
the parties have satisfied the regulatory requirements under the HSR Act. Argo Group and Brookfield
Reinsurance filed the required notifications with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on March 8, 2023.
Insurance and Other Regulatory Matters
The insurance laws and regulations of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia generally require
that before the acquisition of control of an insurance company, either through the acquisition of or merger
with the insurance company or a holding company of that insurance company, the acquiring party must
obtain approval from the insurance regulator of the insurance company’s state of domicile. In addition, under
the laws of certain states, an acquirer must obtain the approval of the state’s insurance regulator to acquire
control of an insurance company that is commercially domiciled in that state.
Applications or notifications in connection with the merger or the changes in control of various
subsidiaries of Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance that may be deemed to occur as a result of the
merger have been filed, pursuant to the merger agreement, with various U.S. state regulatory authorities,
including the Illinois Department of Insurance, New York State Department of Financial Services, Ohio
Department of Insurance, Pennsylvania Insurance Department and Commonwealth of Virginia State
Corporation Commission.
Applications for approval or notifications to certain non-U.S. regulatory authorities have been filed with
the Bermuda Monetary Authority and the Italian Istituto per la vigilanza sulle assicurazioni.
Although Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance do not expect these regulatory authorities to raise
any significant concerns in connection with their review of the merger, there is no assurance that Argo
Group and Brookfield Reinsurance will obtain all required regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, or
that these approvals will not include a restriction, limitation or condition that would trigger a burdensome
condition, which, in such case, would excuse Brookfield Reinsurance from closing the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and consummating the merger.
Other than the approvals and notifications described above, neither Argo Group nor Brookfield
Reinsurance is aware of any material regulatory approvals required to be obtained, or waiting periods
required to expire, after the making of a filing. If the parties discover that other approvals or filings and
waiting periods are necessary, they will seek to obtain or comply with them, although, as is the case with the
regulatory approvals described above, there can be no assurance that they will be obtained on a timely
basis, if at all.",61,62

Paying Agent
Prior to the closing date, Brookfield Reinsurance will designate a paying agent reasonably acceptable to
Argo Group for the payment and delivery of the aggregate merger consideration. At or prior to the effective
time, Brookfield Reinsurance will deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration.
Payment Process
As soon as practicable, but in no event later than three business days after, the effective time, the
surviving company or Brookfield Reinsurance will cause the paying agent to mail a letter of transmittal (in a
form subject to Argo Group’s reasonable approval) to each holder of a share certificate that immediately prior
to
54 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
the effective time evidenced common shares, as well as instructions regarding the procedures by which
holders of share certificates may receive the merger consideration. Upon the completion of such applicable
procedures and the surrender of such holder’s share certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) that
immediately prior to the effective time represented common shares or without any action by holders of book-
entry shares that immediately prior to the effective time represented common shares, the paying agent will
deliver to the holder the merger consideration that the holder is entitled to receive and the share certificates
or book-entry shares will be canceled immediately. No interest will be paid or accrue on the merger
consideration.
Unregistered Transferees
If any merger consideration is to be paid to a person or entity other than the person or entity in whose
name the surrendered Argo Group certificate is registered, it will be a condition to the payment of such
merger consideration to such transferee that the surrendered certificate be properly endorsed or will
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the transferee will have paid any transfer and other required
taxes has been paid or is not applicable.
Withholding
Brookfield Reinsurance, Merger Sub, the surviving company or the paying agent, as applicable, will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the merger agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of payments under any
provision of applicable tax law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental
authority will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
Delisting and Deregistration of Argo Group Shares
If the merger is completed, the common shares will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under
the Exchange Act.
At the effective time, each preferred share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
will continue as a preferred share of Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger and the
relative rights, terms and conditions of each such preferred share will remain unchanged. The depositary
shares (representing interests in such preferred shares) will remain listed on the NYSE and registered by
Argo Group under the Exchange Act immediately after the merger. Brookfield Reinsurance may decide,
following the merger, to delist the depositary shares from the NYSE, to deregister such depositary shares
under the Exchange Act or to take other action with respect to the depositary shares and preferred shares.",62,63

PROVIDED THAT SUCH SHAREHOLDER DOES NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL.

The following describes the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is included
as Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the material
provisions of the merger agreement below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the merger agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain
all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. Argo Group encourages you to
read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the merger as it
is the legal document governing the merger.
The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with
information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and is not intended to provide any factual
information about Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance. Factual disclosures about Argo Group or
Brookfield Reinsurance contained in this proxy statement or Argo Group’s public reports filed with the
SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about Argo Group or Brookfield
Reinsurance contained in the merger agreement and described in the summary. The representations,
warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance and
Merger Sub are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by Argo Group, Brookfield
Reinsurance and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In
particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and
described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were
negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement,
rather than establishing matters as facts, and may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. The
representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be
different from that generally relevant to shareholders or applicable to reports and documents filed with the
SEC, and in some cases are qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by each party to the other,
which disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement or otherwise publicly disclosed. The
representations and warranties in the merger agreement will not survive the completion of the merger.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have
changed since the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information
qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included or incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement. For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any
descriptions of those provisions should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the
information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the documents incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement. See the section of this proxy statement titled “Where You Can Find More
Information.”
The Merger
Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement, and
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Companies Act, at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with
and into Argo Group, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Argo Group will survive
the merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance.
Effects of the Merger
The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, each common share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time (other than any common share that is owned by Argo Group as
treasury shares, by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Argo Group or by Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance,
Merger Sub or wholly-owned subsidiaries of Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or any common share
that is subject to an Argo Group equity award) will be converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash,
without interest and less any required withholding tax. All such common shares will no longer be issued and
outstanding and will be canceled and cease to exist and each holder of a certificate previously evidencing
any common shares or uncertificated common shares represented by book-entry will cease to have any
rights with respect to those shares, except the right to receive the merger consideration.
At the effective time, Brookfield Reinsurance will become the sole owner of Argo Group’s common
shares. Therefore, current Argo Group common shareholders will cease to have direct or indirect ownership
interests in Argo Group or rights as Argo Group common shareholders, will not participate in any future
earnings or growth of Argo Group, will not benefit from any appreciation in value of Argo Group and will not
bear the future risks of Argo Group’s operations.

Company Material Adverse Effect
For the purposes of the merger agreement, a “company material adverse effect” will be deemed to occur
if any effect, change, event, circumstance or development that, individually or in the aggregate with all other
effects, changes, events, circumstances, developments or states of facts, has or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of operations or condition
(financial or otherwise) of Argo Group and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. However, when determining
whether a company material adverse effect has occurred, none of the following, or any effect, change, event,
circumstance or development arising out of, or resulting from, the following, constitute or will be taken into
account, individually or in the aggregate, in determining whether a company material adverse effect has
occurred or may occur (except as expressly noted below):
effects, changes or events generally affecting the insurance, reinsurance or risk management
industries in the geographic regions or product markets in which Argo Group and its subsidiaries
operate or underwrite insurance or reinsurance or manage risk;
general economic or regulatory, legislative or political conditions or securities, credit, financial or
other capital markets conditions in any jurisdiction;
any failure, in and of itself, by Argo Group to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts,
estimates or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for
any period (although the effect, change, event, circumstance or development giving rise or
contributing to such failure that are not otherwise excluded pursuant to another clause of the
definition of company material adverse effect may be deemed to constitute or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would be reasonably be expected to be a company material
adverse effect);
geopolitical conditions, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, any acts of war (whether or not
declared) (including with respect to the Russian Federation and Ukraine or any matter arising
therefrom), sabotage, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), man-made disaster, epidemics, pandemics
or disease outbreaks (including COVID-19 or any COVID-19 measures) or any escalation or worsening
of any of the foregoing;
any volcano, tsunami, hurricane, tornado, windstorm, flood, earthquake, wildfire or other natural
disaster or any conditions resulting from such natural disasters (including increases in liabilities
under or in connection with insurance or reinsurance contracts to which Argo Group or any of its
subsidiaries is a party arising from such a natural disaster);
the negotiation, execution and delivery of the merger agreement or the public announcement,
pendency or performance of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
impact thereof on the relationships of Argo Group or any of its subsidiaries with employees,
customers, insureds, cedants, policyholders, brokers, agents, financing sources, business partners,
service providers,

any change or announcement of a potential changes, in and of itself, in Argo Group’s or any of its
subsidiaries’ credit, financial strength or claims paying ratings or the ratings of any of Argo Group’s
or its subsidiaries’ businesses (although the effect, change, event, circumstance or development
giving rise or contributing to such ratings that are not otherwise excluded pursuant to another clause
of the definition of company material adverse effect may be deemed to constitute or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or would be reasonably be expected to be a company
material adverse effect);
any change, in and of itself, in the market price, ratings or trading volume of Argo Group’s or any of
its subsidiaries’ securities (although the effect, change, event, circumstance or development giving

adverse effect);

enforcement thereof) or in applicable statutory accounting principles (or interpretation or
enforcement thereof), including accounting and financial reporting pronouncements by the SEC, the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners, any insurance regulator and the Financial
Accounting Standards Board or rating agency methodology (although this will not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that the actual consequences of an action taken or an omission by
Argo Group or any of its subsidiaries that resulted in a failure to comply with applicable law is, or
contributed to, a material adverse effect);
any action required to be taken by Argo Group or a subsidiary of Argo Group’s pursuant to the terms
of the merger agreement; or
any failure of Argo Group or any of its subsidiaries to take an action prohibited by the terms of the
merger agreement, but only if Brookfield Reinsurance has refused, after a timely request by Argo
Group, to provide a waiver of the applicable prohibition in the merger agreement.
Certain effects, changes, events, circumstances or developments listed in each of the first, second,
fourth, fifth and ninth bullets above may be taken into account in determining whether a company material
adverse effect has occurred, but only to the extent any such effect, change or event has a disproportionate
adverse effect on Argo Group and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other participants engaged
primarily in the insurance or reinsurance or risk management industries in the geographic regions or product
markets in which Argo Group and its subsidiaries operate or underwrite insurance or reinsurance or manage
risk. In such case, only the incremental disproportionate effect or effects may be taken into account when
determining whether a company material adverse effect has occurred.
Parent Material Adverse Effect
For the purposes of the merger agreement, a “parent material adverse effect” will be deemed to occur if
any effect, change, event, circumstance or development would, or would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay, interfere with, hinder or impair (i) the
consummation by Brookfield Reinsurance or Merger Sub of any of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement on a timely basis or (ii) the compliance by Brookfield Reinsurance or Merger Sub with its
obligations under the merger agreement.",66,69

special general meeting of its shareholders and to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from its
shareholders in favor of the requisite approval of Argo Group shareholders for the merger proposal. Argo
Group has also agreed to not change the record date for the special general meeting of its shareholders
without the prior written consent of Brookfield Reinsurance.
No Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change; Alternative Acquisition Agreements
No Solicitation of Takeover Proposals
Argo Group is prohibited from taking certain actions, summarized in detail below, relating to takeover
proposals. In this proxy statement, and in the merger agreement, a “takeover proposal” means any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any person other than Brookfield Reinsurance and its subsidiaries, relating to a:
acquisition (including any reinsurance or retrocession transaction that has similar risk transfer
effects) that if consummated would result in any person or group owning 20% or more of the
consolidated assets, reserves, revenues or net income of Argo Group and its subsidiaries;
acquisition of Argo Group common shares representing 20% or more of the outstanding common
shares;
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group having
beneficial ownership of common shares representing 20% or more of the outstanding common shares;
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, share purchase, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Argo Group or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to which such person or group (or the shareholders of any person) would
acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of Argo Group or of the
surviving entity in such transaction or the resulting direct or indirect parent of Argo Group or such
surviving entity; or
combination of the foregoing, in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and the statutory merger agreement.
Any transaction meeting the above conditions, whether effected in a single transaction or through a
series of related transactions, or directly or indirectly, is a “takeover proposal.”
Specifically, Argo Group has agreed that it will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries, and its and their
respective directors, officers and employees to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
representatives to immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations of or with
any persons that may be ongoing on or prior to February 8, 2023 with respect to any takeover proposal.
Argo Group has also agreed that, from February 8, 2023, until earlier of the closing date and the date on
which the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, it will, and will cause each of its
subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees to, and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its other representatives to, not, directly or indirectly:
solicit, encourage, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate the submission of any inquiry or
the making of any proposal, in each case, that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a takeover proposal;
engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other person any material non-public information for the purpose of facilitating, a takeover proposal;
or
approve or recommend, make any public statement approving or recommending, or enter into any
letter of intent, agreement or agreement in principle that constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a takeover proposal.
Argo Group has further agreed that it will, to the extent not previously done so prior to February 8, 2023,
promptly deliver a request to each person that has previously executed a confidentiality agreement with
Argo Group during the 12 month period prior to February 8, 2023 in connection with considering or making a
takeover proposal to promptly return to Argo Group or destroy all non-public information previously
furnished or made available to such person or any of its representatives by or on behalf of Argo Group or
62 •

TABLE OF CONTENTS
representatives of Argo Group or any of its subsidiaries and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
dataroom access previously granted to such persons or their representatives.
Argo Group is permitted to waive any standstill provision to allow any person to make a takeover
proposal to the Argo Group board of directors on a non-public basis if the Argo Group board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with Argo Group’s outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the director’s fiduciary duties under applicable
law.
The non-solicitation obligations summarized above do not prohibit Argo Group or its representatives
from contacting a person that has made a takeover proposal delivered to Argo Group prior to the date Argo
Group shareholders approve the merger proposal that did not result from a breach by Argo Group of such
non-solicitation provisions to clarify the terms and conditions of such takeover proposal or to request that
any takeover proposal made orally be made in writing.
If the Argo Group board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with Argo Group’s
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such takeover proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a superior proposal, then Argo Group and its representatives may (i) enter into a
confidentiality agreement with and furnish information (including non-public information) about Argo Group
and its subsidiaries to the person or group of persons making the takeover proposal, and (ii) subsequently
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or group of persons
making such takeover proposal. In no event may Argo Group or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective representatives reimburse or pay, or agree to reimburse or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or
provide or agree to provide any compensation to, any person or group of persons (or any of its or their
representatives or potential financing sources) making a takeover proposal in connection with any of the
foregoing.
If Argo Group enters into a confidentiality agreement and furnishes information (including non-public
information) to a person or group of persons making a takeover proposal, the merger agreement requires
Argo Group to simultaneously provide to Brookfield Reinsurance any information with respect to Argo
Group and its subsidiaries that is provided to any person to the extent access to such information was not
previously provided to Brookfield Reinsurance and its representatives.
Argo Group has agreed to promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Brookfield Reinsurance
upon receipt of any takeover proposal. Argo Group has also agreed to promptly disclose to Brookfield
Reinsurance the material terms and conditions of such takeover proposal (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and the identity of the person or
group of persons making such takeover proposal. Finally, Argo Group has agreed to keep Brookfield
Reinsurance reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material developments with respect to such
takeover proposal (including any material changes thereto).
Adverse Recommendation Change; Termination of the Merger Agreement to Enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement
Except as described below, Argo Group has agreed that its board of directors and any committee of its
board of directors will not:
withdraw or withhold its recommendation that the Argo Group shareholders approve the merger
proposal;
modify, qualify or amend such recommendation in a manner adverse to Brookfield Reinsurance;
fail to include such recommendation in this proxy statement;
approve, adopt or publicly endorse or recommend any takeover proposal or refrain from
recommending against any takeover proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer within 10
business days following the commencement of such offer (or such fewer number of business days as
remain prior to the special general meeting as it may be adjourned or postponed); or
fail to publicly reaffirm such recommendation within 10 business days of receiving a written request
made by Brookfield Reinsurance to make such public reaffirmation following the receipt by Argo
Group of a takeover proposal (or, if the special general meeting is scheduled to be held within
63 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
10 business days of such request, within five business days of such request and in any event, prior
to the date of the special general meeting) (other than in the case of a takeover proposal in the form of
a tender offer or exchange offer) that has not been withdrawn, except that Brookfield Reinsurance may
make any such request only once in any 10 day period and only once for each such takeover
proposal and once for each material amendment to such takeover proposal.
If Argo Group takes any of the above actions it will be deemed an “adverse recommendation change”
and this proxy statement generally refers to any of such actions as an “adverse recommendation change.”
In addition, except as described below, Argo Group has agreed that its board of directors will not
authorize, cause or permit Argo Group or any of its subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
amalgamation agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal, other than a
confidentiality agreement with the person or persons making the takeover proposal.
However, prior to the date Argo Group shareholders approve the merger proposal, in response to a
superior proposal, the Argo Group board of directors may make an adverse recommendation change or cause
Argo Group to terminate the merger agreement and enter into an alternative acquisition agreement and
terminate the merger agreement if:
the Argo Group board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law;
such adverse recommendation change is made or entered into after the fifth business day following
the receipt by Brookfield Reinsurance of written notice from Argo Group advising that its board of
directors intends to take such action and Argo Group discloses to Brookfield Reinsurance (i) the
material terms and conditions of such superior proposal and the identity of the person or group of
persons making such superior proposal and (ii) a copy of the most current version of the acquisition
agreement (if any) with respect to such superior proposal; and
during the period following Brookfield Reinsurance’s receipt of the notice described in the
immediately preceding bullet, (i) Argo Group has, and has caused its representatives to, negotiate
with Brookfield Reinsurance in good faith to make such amendments to the terms and conditions of
the merger agreement as would enable the Argo Group board of directors to no longer make an
adverse recommendation change or a determination that a takeover proposal constitutes a superior
proposal and (ii) the Argo Group board of directors has determined, after considering the results of
such negotiations and any amendments to the merger agreement committed to in writing by
Brookfield Reinsurance, if any, after consulting with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such superior proposal continues to be a superior proposal.
In the event of any change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of a superior proposal,
Argo Group is required to provide an additional written notice to Brookfield Reinsurance and an additional
two business day period to take the actions described in the immediately preceding bullet.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means a bona
fide takeover proposal with respect to Argo Group:
that did not result from a breach by Argo Group of its non-solicitation obligations under the merger
agreement;
where references to “20%”  (e.g., to outstanding assets or share capital) in the definition of “takeover
proposal” are replaced by references to “50%”;
which the Argo Group board of directors has determined, in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all relevant (in the view of Argo
Group’s board of directors) legal, regulatory, financial and other aspects of such proposal (including
the conditionality, timing and likelihood of the consummation of such proposal and the payment of
any termination fee), would be reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed and
would be more favorable to the shareholders of Argo Group than the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
In addition, prior to the date Argo Group shareholders approve the merger proposal, in response to an
intervening event, the Argo Group board of directors may make an adverse recommendation change if:
the Argo Group board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law;
such adverse recommendation change is made or entered into after the fifth business day following
the receipt by Brookfield Reinsurance of written notice from Argo Group advising that its board of
directors intends to take such action and Argo Group discloses to Brookfield Reinsurance the material
effects, changes or events comprising such intervening event; and
during the period following Brookfield Reinsurance’s receipt of the notice described in the
immediately preceding bullet, in determining whether to make an adverse recommendation change, (i)
Argo Group has, and has caused its representatives to, negotiate with Brookfield Reinsurance in
good faith to make such amendments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement as would
enable the Argo Group board of directors to no longer make an adverse recommendation change and
(ii) the Argo Group board of directors has determined, after considering the results of such
negotiations and any amendments to the merger agreement committed to in writing by Brookfield
Reinsurance, if any, after consulting with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure
to make an adverse recommendation change would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable law.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “intervening event” means a material effect, change, event,
circumstance or development occurring or arising after February 8, 2023 that:
was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Argo Group board of directors on February 8,
2023, which effect, change, event, circumstance or development becomes known to the Argo Group
board of directors prior to approval of the merger proposal;
does not relate to a takeover proposal;
does not relate to any changes in the market price or trading volume of Argo Group’s shares (it being
understood that the effect, change, event, circumstance or development giving rise or contributing to
the foregoing may be deemed to constitute or be taken into account in determining whether an
intervening event has occurred); and
does not relate to Argo Group’s meeting, failing to meet or exceeding published or unpublished
revenue or earning projections in and of itself (it being understood that the effect, change, event,
circumstance or development giving rise or contributing to the foregoing may be deemed to
constitute or be taken into account in determining whether an intervening event has occurred).
As described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - 
Expenses and Termination Fee,” Argo Group will be required to pay Brookfield Reinsurance a $37,183,000
termination fee if:
Argo Group’s board of directors makes an adverse recommendation change in response to a superior
proposal or intervening event and Brookfield Reinsurance terminates the merger agreement; or
Argo Group terminates the merger agreement and enters into an alternative acquisition agreement

The merger agreement provides that the Argo Group’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time:
Restricted Shares
Each Argo Group restricted share will (i) become fully vested, in the case of a time-based vesting Argo
Group restricted share, or become vested at an assumed level of performance, in the case of a performance-
based vesting Argo Group restricted share, based on the following: (a) if the effective time occurs prior to
half-way through the applicable performance period, then the number of Argo Group common shares in
respect of such performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share will be based on the applicable
performance goals being deemed to have been satisfied at the target level; and (b) if the effective time occurs
on or after half-way through the applicable performance period, then the number of Argo Group common
shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share will be based on the
projected actual level of performance through the end of the applicable performance period, as determined by
Argo Group board of directors in accordance with the terms of the Argo Group share plans prior to the date
of the effective time taking into account performance through the date of such determination (but, if the
Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith that the projected actual level of performance is not
reasonably determinable, the number of Argo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based
vesting Argo Group restricted share will be based on the target level), and (ii) be canceled and converted

consideration of $30.00 and (y) the value of any dividends accrued in respect of such Argo Group restricted
share that remain unpaid as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, less any required
withholding taxes.
Share Appreciation Rights
Each Argo Group SAR outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested,
will be deemed to be fully vested and will be canceled and converted into solely the right to receive a lump-
sum amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any of (a) the merger
consideration of $30.00, over (b) the per share exercise price of such Argo Group SAR, multiplied by (ii) the
total number of Argo Group common shares subject to such Argo Group SAR immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, less any required withholding taxes.

Employee Share Purchase Plan
Prior to the effective time, Argo Group will take all actions necessary or required under the ESPP to (i)
cause the final purchase period under the ESPP to be terminated no later than four business days prior to the
date on which the effective time occurs, (ii) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect
the final purchase period, but otherwise treat the final purchase period as a fully effective and completed
purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP, (iii) cause the exercise (as of no later than four
business days prior to the date on which the effective time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right
pursuant to the ESPP and (iv) cause the ESPP to be terminated immediately following the end of the final
purchase period. Participants in the ESPP will not be permitted to increase the percentage of their payroll
deduction elections from those in effect as of February 8, 2023, and no additional persons will be permitted
to commence participation in the ESPP from and after February 8, 2023.

Argo Group will use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that participants holding outstanding
options under the UK ESPP will exercise their options effective on the closing date in respect of the maximum
number of Argo Group common shares possible under the terms of their options as of the closing date, and
receive, in respect of each such Argo Group common share, the merger consideration of $30.00 in cash,
without interest and less any required withholding taxes. If a participant in the UK ESPP so exercises their
options, at the closing date, the balance of their options not so exercised, if any, will immediately lapse and
the participant will have a right to receive a compensation payment in cash, without interest and less any
required withholding taxes, in respect of such unexercised options of an amount which is, once paid net of
applicable income tax and employee’s social security due on such gross amount, equal to (i) the merger

Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance agreed in the merger agreement that if for any reason any of the
provisions of the merger agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached or violated, irreparable damage would be caused for which monetary relief would not be an
adequate remedy under applicable law. Accordingly, each of the parties to the merger agreement agreed that,
in addition to all other remedies to which it may be entitled, (i) each of the parties to the merger agreement is
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in the courts in the State
of Delaware or the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware and (ii) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement

be sought without the posting of a bond or other necessary security. The parties agreed not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and
not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.",86,86

Under Bermuda law, and pursuant to Section 106(2)(b)(ii) of the Companies Act, in the event of a merger
of a Bermuda company with another Bermuda company or foreign corporation, a dissenting shareholder of
the Bermuda company is entitled to receive fair value for its shares. For purposes of Section 106(2)(b)(i) of
the Companies Act, the Argo Group board of directors determined that the fair value for (i) each common
share to be $30.00, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes and (ii) each preferred share
(and the related depositary shares) to be the continuation of each such preferred share as a preferred share
of Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger, entitled to the same dividend and other
relative rights, preferences, limitations and restrictions as are now provided by the certificate of designations
of Argo Group’s preferred shares, which certificate of designations will remain at and following the
completion of the merger in full force and effect as an obligation of the surviving company in accordance
with Section 109(2) of the Companies Act.
In accordance with Section 106(2)(b)(ii) of the Companies Act, a dissenting shareholder is entitled to be
paid the fair value of its shares. Any Argo Group shareholder who is not satisfied that it has been offered fair
value for its shares and whose shares are not voted in favor of the merger proposal may exercise its appraisal
rights under Section 106(6) of the Companies Act to have the fair value of its shares appraised by the
Bermuda Court, provided that they otherwise fully comply with the requirements of seeking appraisal under
the Companies Act. Persons owning beneficial interests in shares but who are not shareholders of record
should note that only persons who are shareholders of record are entitled to make an application for
appraisal. Any Argo Group shareholder intending to exercise appraisal rights must file its application for
appraisal of the fair value of its shares with the Bermuda Court within one month after the date of the notice
convening the special general meeting to approve the merger has been given. The notice delivered with this
proxy statement constitutes this notice. There are no statutory rules and limited decisions of the Bermuda
Court prescribing in detail the operation of the provisions of the Companies Act governing appraisal rights
that are set forth in Section 106 of the Companies Act or the process of appraisal by the Bermuda Court; the
Bermuda Court retains considerable discretion as to the precise methodology that it would adopt when
determining the fair value of shares in an appraisal application under the Companies Act.
If an Argo Group shareholder votes in favor of the merger proposal at the special general meeting, such
shareholder will have no right to apply to the Bermuda Court to appraise the fair value of its shares, and
instead, if the merger is consummated, and as discussed in the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger Agreement - Effects of the Merger,” as applicable, each common share of such shareholder will be
canceled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration and each preferred share of such
shareholder will continue as a preferred share of Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger.
Voting against the merger, or not voting, will not in itself satisfy the requirements for notice and exercise of a
shareholder’s right to apply for appraisal of the fair value of its shares.
A FAILURE OF A DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER TO AFFIRMATIVELY VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER
PROPOSAL WILL NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO HAVE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS
COMMON SHARES OR PREFERRED SHARES APPRAISED, PROVIDED THAT SUCH SHAREHOLDER
DOES NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL.
In any case where a registered holder of shares has made an appraisal application, in respect of the
shares held by such dissenting shareholder, and the merger has been made effective under Bermuda law
before the Bermuda Court’s appraisal of the fair value of such dissenting shares, then the dissenting
shareholder will be entitled to receive the consideration and, if the fair value of the dissenting shares is later
appraised by the Bermuda Court to be greater than the value of the consideration, such dissenting
shareholder will be paid the difference, between the amount paid to him as the consideration and the value
appraised by the court within one month of the Bermuda Court’s appraisal.
In any case where the value of the dissenting shares held by a dissenting shareholder is appraised by
the Bermuda Court before the merger has been made effective under Bermuda law, then the surviving
company will be required to pay the dissenting shareholder within one month of the Bermuda Court’s
appraisal an amount equal to the value of the dissenting shares appraised by the Bermuda Court, unless the
merger is terminated under the terms of the merger agreement, in which case no payment will be made.
However, it is anticipated that the merger would have proceeded prior to the appraisal by the Bermuda Court.
87 TABLE OF CONTENTS
A shareholder that has exercised appraisal rights has no right of appeal from an appraisal made by the
Bermuda Court. The responsibility for apportioning the costs of any application to the Bermuda Court under
Section 106 of the Companies Act will be in the discretion of the Bermuda Court.
The relevant portion of Section 106 of the Companies Act in relation to appraisal rights is as follows:
“(6) Any shareholder who did not vote in favor of the amalgamation or merger and who is not satisfied
that he has been offered fair value for his shares may within one month of the giving of the notice referred to
in subsection (2) apply to the Court to appraise the fair value of his shares.
(6A) Subject to subsection (6B), within one month of the Court appraising the fair value of any shares
under subsection (6) the company shall be entitled either -
(a) to pay to the dissenting shareholder an amount equal to the value of his shares as appraised by
the Court; or
(b) to terminate the amalgamation or merger in accordance with subsection (7).
(6B) Where the Court has appraised any shares under subsection (6) and the amalgamation or merger
has proceeded prior to the appraisal then, within one month of the Court appraising the value of the shares,
if the amount paid to the dissenting shareholder for his shares is less than that appraised by the Court, the
amalgamated or surviving company shall pay to such shareholder the difference between the amount paid to
him and the value appraised by the Court.
(6C) No appeal shall lie from an appraisal by the Court under this section.
(6D) The costs of any application to the Court under this section shall be in the discretion of the Court.
(7) An amalgamation agreement or merger agreement may provide that at any time before the issue of a
certificate of amalgamation or merger the agreement may be terminated by the directors of an amalgamating
or merging company, notwithstanding approval of the agreement by the shareholders of all or any of the
amalgamating or merging companies.”
SHAREHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER
NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR
BANKS BROKERAGE FIRMS AND OTHER NOMINEES AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE
PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND
FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE ARGO GROUP COMMON SHARES OR PREFERRED SHARES. A PERSON
HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON,
SUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM AND OTHER NOMINEE MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE
RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO
PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF ARGO GROUP SHARES
If the merger is completed, we expect that Argo Group’s common shares will be delisted from the NYSE
and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Argo Group’s common shares.
However, we will continue to make securities filings with respect to our publicly-held depositary shares
(representing interests in our preferred shares) to the extent such filings are required under SEC regulations
following the completion of the merger. Brookfield Reinsurance may decide, following the merger, to delist
the depositary shares from the NYSE, to deregister such depositary shares under the Exchange Act or take
other action with respect to the depositary shares and preferred shares.

At the special general meeting, Argo Group shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on each of
the following proposals:
Proposal 1: to approve the merger agreement, the statutory merger agreement and the merger;
Proposal 2: on an advisory (non-binding) basis, to approve the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to Argo Group’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger, as described in this proxy statement; and
Proposal 3: to approve an adjournment of the special general meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies, in the event that there are insufficient votes to approve the merger proposal
at the special general meeting.
Holders of common shares issued and outstanding as of the record date will be entitled to vote on each
of the above proposals, whereas holders of preferred shares issued and outstanding as of the record date
will be entitled to vote only on Proposal 1 and Proposal 3.
Consummation of the merger is conditioned on, among other things, the approval of Proposal 1 above,
but is not conditioned on the approval of Proposals 2 or 3.
The Argo Group board of directors unanimously (1) approved the merger agreement, the statutory
merger agreement and the merger, (2) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory
merger are in the best interests of Argo Group, (3) declared the advisability of the merger agreement, the
statutory merger agreement and the merger and (4) resolved to recommend approval of the merger, the merger
agreement and the statutory merger agreement to Argo Group’s shareholders (subject to the right of the
Argo Group board of directors to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation or terminate the merger

Except as provided below, holders of common shares have one vote for each common share held by
them as of the record date and are entitled to vote all common shares held by them as of the record date on
all the proposals voted on at the special general meeting or any adjournment thereof.
Each depositary share represents a 1/1,000th interest in a preferred share. Therefore, holders of
depositary shares will be entitled to 1/1,000th of a vote per share of the preferred shares. Holders of
depositary shares must act through the depositary to exercise any voting rights in respect of the depositary
shares. Although each depositary share is entitled to 1/1,000th of a vote, the depositary can only vote whole
shares of preferred shares. Holders of preferred shares, which underlie the depositary shares, are entitled to
vote only on the merger proposal and the adjournment proposal.
The depositary will mail (or otherwise transmit by an authorized method) the information contained in
this proxy statement to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to the preferred shares. Each
holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the
preferred shares, may instruct the depositary to vote the number of the preferred shares votes represented
by the holder’s depositary shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the number of the
preferred shares votes represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. If
you hold depositary shares, you must submit a voting instruction form no later than 9:00 a.m. local Bermuda
time (8:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on April 13, 2023.
Argo Group will take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the
depositary to vote as instructed. In the absence of specific instructions from certain holders of depositary
shares, the depositary will vote, to the extent permitted by the rules of the NYSE the shares represented by
such depositary shares proportionately with votes cast pursuant to instructions received from the other
holders.
Under Argo Group’s Bye-Laws, no “U.S. Person”  (as that term is defined in Argo Group’s Bye-Laws)
that owns Argo Group shares directly, or indirectly through foreign entities, is entitled to exercise voting
power on a matter (either directly or through a person whose ownership of shares in us is attributed to such
U.S. Person) to the extent such voting power equals or exceeds 9.5% of the votes conferred on all of Argo
Group shares entitled to vote on such matter, after taking into consideration all votes held by such U.S.
Person directly or through attribution. Pursuant to Argo Group’s Bye-Laws, if there is any U.S. Person which
had voting power which equaled or exceeded 9.5% of such shares and so could be considered a “9.5% U.S.
Member”  (as that term is defined in Argo Group’s Bye-Laws) as of the record date, the voting power of all
shares will be adjusted (and will be automatically adjusted in the future) to the extent necessary so that there
will be no such 9.5% U.S. Member.
If your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct
your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee.

If you fail to submit a proxy or to attend and vote in person at the special general meeting and you are a

with voting instructions, your shares will not be voted. If you choose to vote in person at the special general

Abstentions will be counted toward the presence of a quorum at the special general meeting. Because
all proposals presented to shareholders will be considered non-discretionary, your broker, bank or other
nominee will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on any of the proposals without your
instructions and accordingly, there will not be any broker non-votes at the special general meeting. Broker
non-votes (if any) will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not
count as votes cast at the special general meeting.
Because approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power
of the outstanding common shares and preferred shares, voting as one class, that are entitled to vote at the
special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws (assuming a quorum is present), an
abstention will have the effect of a vote against the merger proposal. Because approval of the compensation
advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of common shares
that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special general meeting in
accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws (assuming a quorum is present), an abstention with respect to the
compensation advisory proposal will not have the effect of a vote for or against the compensation advisory
proposal, but will reduce the number of votes cast and therefore increase the relative influence of those
shareholders voting. Because approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting power of the common shares and preferred shares, voting as one class,
that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special general meeting in
accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws, an abstention with respect to the adjournment proposal will have
the effect of a vote against the adjournment proposal, but common shares or preferred shares deemed not in
attendance at the special general meeting, whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name”
holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee, will have
no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal.",100,100

merger agreement and the merger, (2) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory

PROPOSAL 2 - APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION ADVISORY PROPOSAL
Argo Group is providing the holders of common shares with the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-
binding) vote to approve the “golden parachute” compensation payments that will or may be made to Argo
Group’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as required by the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange
Act. This proposal, commonly known as “say-on-golden parachute,” gives the holders of common shares
the opportunity to vote on an advisory (non-binding) basis on the “golden parachute” compensation
payments that will or may be paid by Argo Group to Argo Group’s named executive officers that is based on
or otherwise relates to the merger.
The “golden parachute” compensation that Argo Group’s named executive officers may be entitled to
receive that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger is summarized in the table titled “Golden Parachute
Compensation,” which can be found in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Interests of
Argo Group’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Merger Related Compensation for Argo
Group Named Executive Officers.” Such summary, in table form, includes all compensation and benefits that
may or will be paid to Argo Group’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger.
The Argo Group board of directors encourages you to review carefully the “golden parachute”
compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.
The Argo Group board of directors unanimously recommends that the holders of common shares
approve the following resolution on a non-binding advisory basis:
“RESOLVED, that the holders of common shares approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
compensation that will or may become payable by Argo Group to its named executive officers that is based
on or otherwise relates to the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Golden
Parachute Compensation table and the related narrative disclosures.”
Only common shares issued and outstanding on the record date will carry the right to vote on this
proposal.
The vote on the compensation advisory proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the
merger proposal. Since the vote on the compensation advisory proposal is advisory only, it will not be
binding on either Brookfield Reinsurance or Argo Group. Accordingly, if the merger proposal is approved
and the merger is consummated, the compensation payments that are contractually required to be paid to
Argo Group’s named executive officers will or may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,
regardless of the outcome of the advisory (non-binding) vote of the holders of common shares.
Each common share issued and outstanding as of the record date will carry the right to vote on the
compensation advisory proposal.
The approval of the compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast by holders of common shares that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote at the special general meeting in accordance with Argo Group’s Bye-Laws.
Approval of this proposal is not a condition to consummation of the merger.

The special general meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to
permit, among other things, further solicitation of proxies if necessary to obtain additional votes in favor of
the merger proposal.
If, at the special general meeting, the number of common shares present in person or represented by
proxy and voting in favor of the merger proposal is insufficient to approve such proposals, Argo Group
intends to move to adjourn the special general meeting in order to solicit additional proxies for the approval
of the merger proposal. Argo Group does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal has
been approved at the special general meeting.
In this proposal, Argo Group is asking its shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by
the Argo Group board of directors to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to proxy holders, and
each of them individually, to adjourn the special general meeting to another time and place for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies. If Argo Group shareholders approve this adjournment proposal, Argo Group
could adjourn the special general meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including
the solicitation of proxies from Argo Group shareholders who have previously voted.

The following is a general summary of the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the merger
applicable to U.S. holders of common shares and U.S. holders of preferred shares.
The following discussion is based upon the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations, judicial authorities,
published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as
currently in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing
interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect). This discussion is limited to U.S. holders that hold their
common shares or preferred shares as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, property
held for investment purposes). This discussion does not address all of the tax consequences that may be
relevant to a particular shareholder, such as the application of the Medicare contribution tax on certain net
investment income or the alternative minimum tax, or to shareholders that are subject to special treatment
under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as:
financial institutions;
mutual funds;
tax-exempt organizations;
insurance companies;
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities (and investors in such entities);
shareholders that hold an interest in an entity that holds common shares or preferred shares;
dealers in securities or currencies;
traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities;
shareholders that hold their common shares or preferred shares as part of a “straddle,” “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction;
shareholders who acquired their common shares or preferred shares pursuant to the exercise of
employee share options or otherwise in connection with the performance of services;
shareholders who have a functional currency other than the United States dollar;
shareholders who own, or have owned, directly, indirectly or constructively, 10% or more of the total
combined voting power or value of all classes of issued and outstanding stock of Argo Group;
Brookfield Reinsurance and any of its affiliates;
shareholders who own or will acquire shares of stock in Brookfield Reinsurance;
shareholders who are not U.S. holders; and
shareholders who exercise their appraisal rights.
If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) is an Argo Group shareholder, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership
will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner in a
partnership holding common shares or preferred shares should consult its own tax advisor with respect to
the tax consequences of the merger.
This discussion does not address tax considerations under U.S. state, local and non-U.S. laws or other
U.S. federal taxes (such as gift or estate taxes).
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of common shares or
preferred shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of
the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax
regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust that (A) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the
United States

Tax Consequences of the Merger, Generally
The exchange of common shares for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement will be
a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the discussion titled “- Passive Foreign
Investment Company,” a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
upon the receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for common shares in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the cash received and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares
exchanged. Subject to the discussion titled “- Related Person Insurance Income,” such gain or loss will be
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss provided that a U.S. holder’s holding period for
such common shares exceeds one year on the date of the exchange. Long-term capital gains recognized by
certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Any such capital gain or loss recognized by
U.S. holders generally will be treated as U.S.-source gain or loss.
If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of common shares at different times or at different prices, such
U.S. holder must determine its, his or her gain or loss, adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with
respect to each block of common shares.
Passive Foreign Investment Company (“PFIC”)
In general, a foreign corporation will be treated as a PFIC during a given year if either (1) 75% or more of
its gross income constitutes passive income or (2) 50% or more of its assets produce, or are held for the
production of, passive income (“passive assets”). For these purposes, passive income includes interest,
dividends and other investment income, with certain exceptions, and certain look-through rules apply with
respect to interests in subsidiaries. However, under an “active insurance” exception in the Code and
applicable regulations, passive income does not include any income derived in the active conduct of an
insurance business by a qualifying insurance corporation (“QIC”) or any income of a qualifying domestic
insurance corporation (“QDIC”), and passive assets do not include assets of a QIC available to satisfy
liabilities of the QIC related to its insurance business, if the QIC is engaged in the active conduct of an
insurance business, or assets of a QDIC.
Argo Group does not believe that it is, or ever has been, a PFIC. This is based in part on the belief that
the income and assets of certain of Argo Group’s subsidiaries qualifies for the active insurance exception.
The statute commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Public Law No: 115-97) modified certain
provisions relating to PFIC status that makes it more difficult for a non-U.S. insurance company to qualify
under the above-mentioned active insurance exception. Although Argo Group believes that it has qualified
for the active insurance exception as amended, we cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with this
conclusion. In addition, the determination of PFIC status is factual in nature, depends on the application of
complex U.S. federal income tax rules that are subject to differing interpretations, and generally cannot be
determined until the close of the taxable year in question. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Argo
Group is or was not a PFIC for its current or any prior taxable year.
If Argo Group were a PFIC for the taxable year of the merger or any prior taxable year in which the U.S.
holder held common shares, unless the U.S. holder had certain timely and effective elections in place with
respect to their common shares, any gain recognized by a U.S. holder on the exchange of common shares for
the merger consideration pursuant to the merger generally would be allocated ratably over such U.S. holder’s
holding period for the common shares. The amount allocated to the taxable year of the merger and to any
taxable year before Argo Group became a PFIC would be treated as ordinary income. The amount allocated to
each other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for that year and the interest

The continuation of preferred shares as preferred shares of Argo Group as the surviving company
following the merger will not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders of
preferred shares will not recognize any income, gain or loss upon the continuation of their preferred shares
as preferred shares of Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger, and will retain an adjusted
tax basis and holding period in their surviving company preferred shares equal to the adjusted tax basis and
holding period such U.S. holder had in their preferred shares prior to the merger.

If the merger proposal is approved by Argo Group’s shareholders and the merger is completed, Argo
Group will not hold an annual general meeting in 2023 (the “annual general meeting”). If the merger is not
completed in 2023 for any reason, Argo Group will hold an annual general meeting in 2023 as required by
Bermuda law.
As described in our annual proxy statement for the 2022 annual general meeting filed on October 31,
2022, and under SEC rules and our Bye-Laws, shareholders must follow certain prescribed procedures to
introduce an item of business at an annual general meeting. Each of the deadlines below assumes that the
2023 annual general meeting of shareholders will be held on December 15, 2023 (if a meeting is held), and is
subject to change if the 2023 annual general meeting is held on a different date. In the event that Argo Group
determines to hold the 2023 annual general meeting on a date other than December 15, 2023, Argo Group will
publicly announce such date and the new deadlines for the matters described below to its shareholders.
Under these procedures, if a shareholder desires to present a proposal for inclusion in Argo Group’s
2023 proxy statement, such shareholder must submit the proposal in writing to us not later than June 30,
2023, which is 120 days before the anniversary of the date Argo Group mailed its proxy statement to
shareholders for the 2022 annual general meeting. If the date of the 2023 annual general meeting is changed
by more than 30 days from the date of the 2022 annual general meeting, such proposals must be submitted in
writing to Argo Group a reasonable amount of time before Argo Group begins to print and send its proxy
materials. Proposals must comply with the proxy rules relating to shareholder proposals, in particular Rule
14a-8 under the Exchange Act, to be included in Argo Group’s 2023 proxy materials.
Shareholders who wish to submit a proposal or director nomination for consideration at Argo Group’s
2023 annual general meeting, but who do not wish to submit a proposal for inclusion in Argo Group’s proxy
materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, should deliver a copy of their proposal or
nomination to us for receipt not later than 60 days prior to the date of our 2023 annual general meeting (such
deadline currently expected to be on or about October 16, 2023). Any such notice must also meet certain
other requirements specified in our Bye-Laws. In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under our
Bye-Laws, to comply with the universal proxy rules, shareholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of
director nominees other than Argo Group’s nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information
required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than October 16, 2023.
In addition to satisfying the requirements under our Bye-Laws with respect to advance notice of any
nomination, any shareholder that intends to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than Argo
Group’s director nominees in accordance with Rule 14a-19 must provide notice to Argo Group at the address
below no later than 60 calendar days prior to the anniversary of the previous year’s annual meeting or 60
calendar days prior to the date of the 2023 annual general meeting if the meeting date has changed more than
30 days from the date of this year’s annual general meeting (such deadline currently expected to be on or
about October 16, 2023). Any such notice of intent to solicit proxies must comply with all the requirements of
Rule 14a-19.
In each case, the notices described above should be delivered to Argo Group International Holdings,
Ltd. c/o Allison D. Kiene, General Counsel and Secretary, Wellesley House, 90 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM

We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company,
Brookfield Reinsurance, Significant Shareholder and their respective affiliates and BC and its affiliates and
portfolio companies, for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking may receive compensation. Affiliates of
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC also may have co-invested with BC, Significant Shareholder and their respective
affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units or other securities, as
applicable, of BC, Significant Shareholder and/or their respective affiliates from time to time and may do so in
the future.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports
to shareholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K and 10-K/A of the Company for the five years ended
December 31, 2021; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the
Company; certain other communications from the Company to its shareholders; certain publicly available
research analyst reports for the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the
Company prepared by its management, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have
also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of
the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; compared certain financial and stock market
information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are
publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the insurance
industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other
factors, including Sections 2.06 and 6.01(a)(i) of the Agreement, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the
accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information
provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.
We are not actuaries and our services did not include any actuarial determination or evaluation by us or any
attempt to evaluate actuarial assumptions and we have relied on your actuaries with respect to reserve
adequacy. In that regard, we have made no analysis of, and express no opinion as to, the adequacy of the
loss and loss adjustments expenses reserves of the Company. We have assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be
obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to
our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the
Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any
way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the
Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be
available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance
and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $30.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other
term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including,
the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of
any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the
amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of
the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $30.00 in
the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $30.00 in
cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of Shares
pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the
Shares will trade at any time or, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock
markets on the Company, Brookfield Reinsurance or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction
on the solvency or viability of the Company or Brookfield Reinsurance or the ability of the Company or

Shares”), any preferred shares, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (“Company Preferred Shares”) or
any shares, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub (“Merger Sub Shares”):
(a) Share Capital of Merger Sub. Each Merger Sub Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into and become one (1) duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving
Company, and such converted shares, together with the Series A Preferred Shares, shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of the Surviving Company.

(a) Paying Agent. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Paying
Agent”) for the payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Company Shares in accordance with this Article III and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an
agreement with the Paying Agent prior to the Closing Date in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Company Shares (such cash, and the cash referred to in the immediately following sentence,
being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Fund shall be held in trust by the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares that are entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration. Pending its disbursement in accordance with this Section 3.02, the Exchange Fund shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United
States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper
rated the highest quality by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor’s Ratings
Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $5,000,000,000. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Company to promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments
to former holders of Company Shares of the Merger Consideration. No investment losses resulting from
investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any former holder
of Company Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than the payment to holders of Company Shares of the Merger
Consideration.
(b) Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Company Shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time (but in no event later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Company or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced any Company Shares (“Company Share Certificates”)
a form of letter of transmittal (which (i) shall specify that delivery of a Company Share Certificate shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Company Share Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery
of such Company Share Certificate to the Paying Agent and (ii) shall be in such form and have such
other customary provisions as the Surviving Company may specify, subject to the Company’s
reasonable approval (to be obtained prior to the Effective Time)), together with instructions thereto,
setting forth, inter alia, the procedures by which holders of Company Share Certificates may receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III. Upon the completion of such applicable
procedures by a holder and the surrender of such holder’s Company Share Certificates (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.02(c)) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and without
any action by any holder of record of Book-Entry Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any Company Shares (“Company Book-Entry Shares”), the Paying Agent shall deliver to
such holder (other than any holder of Company Shares representing Dissenting Shares), (A) in the case
of Company Book-Entry Shares, a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger and (B) cash in an amount
(subject to
A-17 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 3.02(g)) equal to the number of Company Shares represented by such Company Share
Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Merger Consideration, and such Company Share Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares shall
forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name a Company Share Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Company Share Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company that any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder either has been paid or is not applicable. Until satisfaction of the applicable procedures
contemplated by this Section 3.02 and subject to Section 3.04, each Company Share Certificate or
Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration formerly represented by such Company Share Certificate or
Company Book-Entry Share as contemplated by this Article III. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on the cash payable with respect to Company Shares pursuant to this Article III.
(c) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Company Share Certificates. If any Company Share Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Company Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Share
Certificate, the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Share Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Article III.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time following the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been delivered to the
Paying Agent and which has not been disbursed to former holders of Company Shares, and thereafter
such former holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for, and Parent
and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claims of the Merger Consideration
that such former holders have the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.
(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
parties, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar applicable Law.
(f) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. The Merger Consideration
paid in respect of each Company Share in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however,  t o  Section 3.04. At the
Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company of Company
Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares formerly represented by Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
underlying Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to
the last sentence of Section 3.02(d), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this Article III.
(g) Withholding Taxes. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement (including in respect of Company Awards) such amounts as are required to

Effective Time taking into account performance through the date of such determination; provided,
further, that if the Company Board determines in good faith that the projected actual level of

Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists
that presents a risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring such liability that would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there has been no non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning

transactions that would not reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No Company Plan is, or within the last six (6) years has been, the subject
of an examination, investigation or audit by a Governmental Authority, or is the subject of an

(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will (i) result in any material severance payment or
benefit becoming due to any current or former employee, officer, director or other natural individual
service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) materially increase, or enhance the terms of, any

and Parent shall have the right to review in advance and, subject to any restrictions under applicable
Law, each shall consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and each party agrees to in good faith
consider and reasonably accept comments of the other parties thereon. Parent and the Company shall
promptly furnish to each other copies of all such filings and written materials after their filing or
submission, in each case subject to applicable Laws. The Company and Parent shall promptly advise
each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority with respect to any
Consent necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions, including promptly furnishing
each other copies of any written or electronic communication, and shall promptly advise each other
when any such communication causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any such Consent will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed
or conditioned. The Company and Parent shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
permit any of their respective Representatives to participate in any live or telephonic meeting (other
than non-substantive scheduling or administrative calls) with any Governmental Authority in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the Transactions unless it consults with the other
in advance and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event will any party be required to disclose to any other party any Personal
Information.

refrain from taking or to agree to it, its Subsidiaries or the Company or its Subsidiaries taking or
refraining from taking any action (including any amendment, waiver or termination of any agreement,
exhibit or schedule, including this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement) or to
suffer to exist any limitation, action, restriction, condition or requirement which, individually or together
with all other such limitations, actions, restrictions, conditions or requirements by a Governmental
Authority in connection with a Required Regulatory Approval, would, or would reasonably be expected
to, (i) impose any requirement on Brookfield, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to make, or
commit to make, any material capital contribution or enter into or issue any material capital guarantee or
material keepwell, (ii) impose any requirement on Brookfield or any of its Affiliates to sell, license,
assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, before or after the Closing, any assets or

transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, before or after the Closing, any assets or
businesses that are material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) impose any limitation,
action, restriction, condition or requirement on Brookfield or any of its Affiliates, investment funds,
permanent capital vehicles, or other collective investment vehicles or portfolio companies of the
foregoing, (v) impose any limitation, action, restriction, condition or requirement on Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that is material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (vi) impose any limitation,
action, restriction, condition or requirement on the business or operations of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including as part of the AIC Plan, following the Closing that is material and adverse to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each, a “Burdensome Condition”). Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) take any
action or agree to the taking or refraining from any action or accept any limitation, action, restriction,
condition or requirement that, individually or in the aggregate, would, or would be reasonably expected
to, result in a Burdensome Condition. The parties and their respective Representatives shall promptly

Documents and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this
Agreement or in any agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for
indemnification between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnitee. Without limiting
the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the memorandum of association and bye-laws of the Surviving Company to contain
provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company
Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to advance the reasonable and documented
expenses (including reasonable and documented fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee
under this Section 6.07 (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
referred to in this Section 6.07) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;
provided that the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.07(a).

release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise
consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company

Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to put in place effective as of the Effective Time, and Parent
or the Company, as applicable, shall fully prepay no later than immediately prior to the Closing, prepaid
and non-cancellable “tail” insurance with a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time on terms and conditions providing at least equivalent benefits and coverage as the
directors’ and officers’ liability, employment practices liability and fiduciary liability insurance of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective Time (“Current D&O Insurance”) with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Transactions; provided,
however, that Parent may elect in its sole discretion, but shall not be required, to spend (or cause the
Surviving Company to spend) more than 325% of the Current D&O Insurance annual premium (the “Cap
Amount”) with respect to the annual premium for the six (6) years of coverage under such “tail”
policies; provided, further, that if the cost of such insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, and Parent elects
not to spend more than the Cap Amount for such purpose, then Parent shall purchase and obtain
insurance with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such Cap Amount. If such “tail”
insurance has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain
insurance pursuant to this Section 6.07(c) and the Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such “tail” insurance to be maintained in full force and effect without amendment to any
of the policies’ terms and conditions, for their full term, and to honor all of the Surviving Company’s
obligations thereunder.
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.07 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnitee and his or her heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for,

entitled pursuant to the paid time off policy or individual agreement or other arrangement applicable to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Paid Time Off Policy”), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) allow such Company Employee to use such accrued

Employee would have received a cash payment therefor under and in accordance with the terms of such
Paid Time Off Policy as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(d) With respect to the employee benefit plans of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates in which the Company Employee is eligible to participate on or following the Effective Time,
including any “employee benefit plan”  (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any paid time off
and severance plans) and subject to applicable Law, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, and vesting, each Company Employee’s service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates (or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving
Company, its successors and assigns); provided, however, that the foregoing need not be recognized
with respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan, for purposes of any post-
employment welfare benefit plan, or to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits for the same period of service.
(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.09(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations and exclusions and
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods, in each case under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in which Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent
that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company or any of its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.
(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.09(a), in respect of the Company’s calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall honor and pay, or shall cause to be honored and paid, to
each Company Employee an annual or short-term cash bonus (the “Annual Bonus”) in the normal
course subject to the Company Employee’s continued employment through the regularly scheduled
payment date; provided that Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to each Company Employee an
Annual Bonus for the Company’s calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs in an amount no less
than the amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such Company Employee’s full bonus
entitlement under the applicable Company Plan for the Company’s calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs, based on the actual level of performance as determined by the Company Board prior to the
Closing under the terms of such Company Plan in effect as of the date hereof, taking into account
performance through the date of such determination, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which equals
the number of days that have elapsed from January 1 of such calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs through the Closing and the denominator of which equals 365 (the “Pro-Rata Bonus”); provided
that if (x) the Effective Time occurs other than between to January 1, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and (y)
prior to the date on which the Annual Bonus is paid, a Company Employee’s employment is terminated
in a manner in which such Company Employee becomes entitled to severance pursuant to a Company
Plan or such other employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Affiliates (but excluding the ESP), then such Company Employee shall be entitled to receive
(without duplication for any amount payable in respect of an Annual Bonus upon such termination
under another Company Plan) the Pro-Rata Bonus no later than ten (10) business days following such
employment termination. During the Continuation Period, and without any duplication of any payments
contemplated by this Section 6.09(f), each Company Employee who was eligible to participate in an

date may be extended pursuant to the first proviso of this Section 8.01(b)(i), the “Outside Date”);

to the consummation of the Merger have been satisfied (or, in the case of conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied on that date), then the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended to February 8, 2024; provided, further, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if the
breach by such party of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or the failure
of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, its failure to act in good faith

Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing proviso);

have become final and nonappealable; provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.01(b)(ii) shall have performed in all material respects its obligations

Section 7.03 Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The obligations of the Company to effect the
Merger are further subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under applicable Law) on or prior to
the Closing Date of the following conditions:
(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub
(i) set forth in Sections 5.02(a), 5.02(b), 5.02(d), Section 5.06 and 5.10 shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as
though made as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which
case as of such date) and (ii) set forth in this Agreement, other than those Sections specifically
identified in clause (i) of this Section 7.03(a), shall be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or
limitations as to “materiality,” “Parent Material Adverse Effect” and words of similar import set forth
therein) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as though
made as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such date), except, in the case of this clause (ii), where the failure to be true and correct would not,

Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by an executive
officer of Parent to such effect.
(b) Obligations and Agreements. Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied in all
material respects with the obligations and agreements required to be performed or complied with by

of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, its failure to act in good faith

extent required by and subject to Section 6.04, has been a principal cause of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated on or prior to such date (it being understood that Parent and Merger
Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing proviso);
(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 7.01(c) shall be in effect and shall

failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or

reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by the earlier of the Outside Date and

Section 9.07 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.
(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that state, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of laws principles, except to the
extent the provisions of the Laws of Bermuda are mandatorily applicable to this Agreement or the
Transactions.
(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
this Agreement and in respect of the Transactions (except to the extent any such proceeding
mandatorily must be brought in Bermuda) shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any federal court within the State of Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the
federal courts within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
other state court within the State of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate court therefrom. The
parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such
Actions and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the
maintenance of any such Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.07(b)
shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on
any Person other than the parties. Each party agrees that service of process upon such party in any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight
courier at the address set forth in Section 9.10 of this
A-63 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Agreement. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable
Law; provided, however, that nothing contained in the foregoing shall restrict any party’s rights to seek
any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the
parties fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the right of the Company to cause the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement) in the courts described in Section 9.07(b) without proof of damages
or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and
(b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the
Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The parties agree not to assert that a remedy
of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise
have an adequate remedy at law. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.08 shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

be entitled to receive such difference from the Surviving Company by payment made within
one (1) month after such Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal
procedure. In the event of an Appraisal Withdrawal, such holder’s Dissenting Shares shall be
canceled and converted as of the Effective Time into, with respect to Dissenting Shares that

this Section 7.1, then this Agreement shall terminate and there shall be no other liability between
the parties thereto.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any partnership or agency relationship
between any of the parties.

Plan of Merger, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto and their Affiliates, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
Any variation of this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by or on behalf of all parties.
Any waiver of any right under this Agreement shall only be effective if it is in writing, and shall
apply only in the circumstances for which it is given and shall not prevent the party who has given
the waiver from subsequently relying on the provision it has waived. No failure or delay by a party
hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other

party to this Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained
in this Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one remedy
shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts

Governing Law; Jurisdiction
This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that state,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of laws principles,
except to the extent the provisions of the Laws of Bermuda are mandatorily applicable to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

Agreement and in respect of the Transactions (except to the extent any such proceeding
mandatorily must be brought in Bermuda) shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery
and the federal courts within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any other state court within the State of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate court
therefrom. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such
courts in any such Actions and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of
jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set
forth in this Section 9.2 shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of
Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall
not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties. Each party agrees that service
of process upon such party in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in Section 8 of this
Agreement. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing contained in the foregoing shall restrict any
party’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court
judgment.
