The Special Meeting
The Virtual Special Meeting (see page 26)
The special meeting of Avalara shareholders (the “special meeting”) is scheduled to be held virtually on October 14, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time.
You will be able to attend the special meeting by visiting www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm, where you will be able to listen to the special
meeting, submit questions, and vote. To participate in the special meeting, you must pre-register at www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm by 9:00
a.m., Eastern Time on Thursday, October 13, 2022. You will not be able to attend the meeting in person. For purposes of attendance at the special
meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present in person” or “in person” shall mean virtually present at the special meeting. At the
special meeting, shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the merger agreement (the “merger proposal”). Approval
of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Avalara
common stock entitled to vote thereon.
Purpose of the Special Meeting (see page 26)
At the special meeting, Avalara shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to approve the merger agreement (the “merger proposal”);
•
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Avalara to its named executive officers
that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the “named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal”); and
•
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, for the purpose of soliciting
additional votes for the approval of the merger proposal if there are insufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of the
special meeting or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement is timely provided to Avalara
shareholders (the “adjournment proposal”).
The Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Avalara and Avalara shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
the merger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger in accordance with the WBCA, (ii) adopted the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, in accordance with WBCA and (iii) adopted a resolution
2
Table of Contents
recommending the merger agreement be approved by Avalara shareholders. The Board unanimously recommends that Avalara shareholders vote
“FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and “FOR” the adjournment
proposal.
Avalara shareholders must vote to approve the merger proposal as a condition for the merger to occur. If Avalara shareholders fail to approve the
merger proposal by the requisite vote, the merger will not occur.
Record Date; Shareholders Entitled to Vote (see page 27)
Only holders of Avalara common stock at the close of business on September 8, 2022, the record date for the special meeting (the “record date”), will
be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. For at least 10 days prior
to the special meeting, a complete list of shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for examination by any shareholder, for
any purpose germane to the special meeting, during ordinary business hours at our principal office at 255 South King Street, Suite 1800, Seattle,
Washington 98104. If you would like to view the shareholder list, please contact our Investor Relations department in advance at
investor@avalara.com. The list will be available during the entire time of the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 88,557,882
shares of Avalara common stock were issued and outstanding.
Holders of Avalara common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Avalara common stock they own at the close of business on the record
date.
Quorum (see page 27)
The presence at the virtual special meeting, in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
shares of Avalara common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting will
constitute a quorum. Shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting may participate in the meeting by remote communication. To participate in
the special meeting, you must pre-register at www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm by 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time on Thursday, October 13, 2022.
Actual attendance at the virtual special meeting is not required in order to be counted for purposes of determining a quorum if voting by proxy.
There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will
necessitate an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting and may subject Avalara to additional expense. If no quorum is present at the
special meeting, the shareholders holding a majority in voting power of shares of Avalara common stock, present in person at the virtual special
meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting, may adjourn the special meeting.
Required Vote (see page 27)
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares of Avalara common
stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote thereon. If you do not vote, if you do not submit your proxy, or
you fail to instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee how to vote your shares, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger
proposal.
Approval of each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal requires that the
number of votes cast “FOR” such proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of votes “AGAINST” such proposal.
Attendance and Voting at the Special Meeting (see page 29)
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered a “shareholder of record” and you may vote your
shares virtually at the special meeting or by submitting a proxy by mail, over
3
Table of Contents
the internet, or by telephone If you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, you will be able to vote your shares electronically. Although Avalara
offers four different methods for shares to be voted at the special meeting, Avalara encourages you to submit a proxy over the internet or by
telephone, which are convenient, cost-effective, and reliable methods of causing your shares to be voted. If you choose to submit a proxy over the
internet, or by telephone there is no need for you to mail back your proxy card. To participate in the special meeting, you must pre-register at
www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm by 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time on Thursday, October 13, 2022. After completing the registration request,
shareholders will receive a confirmation email with a link and instructions for accessing the special meeting.
If your shares are held by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and you will
receive a voting instruction form from your broker, bank, or other nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted. If
you are not the shareholder of record, you must register in advance to participate in the special meeting virtually over the internet by going to the
website www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm. To register to attend and vote in person at the special meeting virtually you must obtain a legal
proxy, in PDF or Image (gif, jpg, or png) file format, from your broker, bank, or other nominee, or other communication containing your control
number and follow the instructions to complete your registration request, which must be completed no later than 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on
Thursday, October 13, 2022. After completing the registration request, shareholders will receive a confirmation email with a link and instructions for
accessing the special meeting.
Avalara recommends that you submit a proxy or submit your voting instructions as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the special
meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented and voted at the special meeting. If you return an executed proxy and do not indicate how
you wish to vote with regard to a particular proposal, your shares of Avalara common stock will be voted “FOR” such proposal. Under applicable
stock exchange rules, banks, brokers, and other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the
special meeting are non-routine matters, and hence banks, brokers, and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions.
Therefore, it is important that you cast your vote or instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
Solicitation of Proxies (see page 30)
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and Avalara will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) has been retained
to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Avalara will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $45,000 and will reimburse Innisfree for its reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses for these and related services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies
and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks, and other nominees to the beneficial owners of shares of Avalara common
stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by
telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of Avalara’s directors,
officers, and employees.
Adjournments and Postponements (see page 30)
In addition to the merger proposal and the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal, Avalara shareholders are also
being asked to approve the adjournment proposal, which will enable the adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
votes in favor of the merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal or to ensure
that any supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement is timely provided to Avalara shareholders. If no quorum is present at the
special meeting, the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of shares of Avalara common stock, present in person
at the virtual special meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting, may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date, or time.
Assuming
4
Table of Contents
a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of shares of Avalara common stock present and entitled to vote
on the adjournment proposal will be required to approve the adjournment proposal. In addition, the special meeting could be postponed before it
commences. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional votes on the merger proposal, shareholders
who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals. If you submit a proxy and
do not indicate how you wish to vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.
Avalara may postpone, recess or adjourn the special meeting (i) to the extent required by law or fiduciary duty, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time
to solicit additional proxies to the extent Avalara reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the approval of the merger proposal for a period of
up to 10 business days, or (iii) if as of the time for which the special meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Avalara common
stock represented (either in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the special meeting.
The Merger
Structure of the Merger (see page 32)
Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the WBCA, at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with
and into Avalara, with Avalara continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger and as a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Merger Consideration—What Shareholders Will Receive in the Merger (see page 32)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each outstanding share of Avalara common stock (other
than shares that may be held by Avalara as treasury stock or shares owned by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or held directly by
Parent or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (including Merger Sub)), and other than any shares owned by any shareholder who has properly
exercised and perfected such holder’s demand for dissenters’ rights pursuant to Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and who has not effectively
withdrawn or otherwise irrevocably lost or failed to perfect such holder’s dissenters’ rights, will be automatically converted into the right to receive
$93.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Treatment of Avalara Equity Awards (see page 32)
The merger agreement provides that outstanding equity-based awards issued under Avalara’s equity incentive plans will be treated as set forth
below:
Options. Each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Avalara common stock (an “Option”), whether vested or unvested, will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock
subject to such Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over the exercise price per share under such Option,
less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Each Option with an exercise price per share greater than or equal to
the per share merger consideration will be cancelled automatically at the effective time for no consideration.
Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”). Each outstanding RSU that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time or that vests as a
result of the consummation of the merger will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes
required to be withheld by applicable law) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such vested RSU, multiplied by
(ii) the per share merger consideration. Each outstanding RSU that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the
5
Table of Contents
effective time will be converted into the contingent right to receive from Parent or Avalara an aggregate amount in cash (without interest) (each, a
“Converted Cash Award”) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such unvested RSU, multiplied by (ii) the per
share merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Unless provided otherwise in the merger
agreement, each such Converted Cash Award will continue to have, and be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions that applied to the
corresponding unvested RSU forfeited immediately prior to the effective time.
Performance Share Units (“PSUs”). Each outstanding PSU that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law) equal to (i) the total
number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such vested PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award
agreement), multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration. Each outstanding PSU that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time will be converted into (without interest) a Converted Cash Award with respect to an amount equal to (i) the total number of shares of
Avalara common stock subject to such unvested PSU (as determined in accordance with the merger agreement), multiplied by (ii) the per share
merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Each such Converted Cash Award will have,
and be subject to, the vesting terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement to the corresponding unvested PSUs forfeited
immediately prior to the effective time.
Effects on Avalara if the Merger Is Not Completed (see page 33)
If the merger proposal is not approved by Avalara shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Avalara shareholders will not
receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, Avalara will remain an independent public company and shares of
Avalara common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic
reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, Avalara expects that management will operate Avalara’s business in a manner similar
to that in which it is being operated today and that Avalara shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which
they are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Avalara operates and adverse
economic conditions. Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be
completed, it is likely that the price of Avalara’s common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of
Avalara’s common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement. Accordingly, if the merger is not
completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of Avalara’s common stock.
Further, if the merger agreement is validly terminated under certain specified circumstances, Avalara may be required to pay Parent a termination fee
of $242.329 million or Parent may be required to pay Avalara a termination fee of $484.659 million. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”
beginning on page 100 for a discussion of the circumstances under which such fee may be payable.
The Board unanimously recommends that Avalara shareholders vote:
•
“FOR” the merger proposal;
•
“FOR” the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal; and
•
“FOR” the adjournment proposal.
Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (see page 53)
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) rendered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated August 8,
2022, that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon
6
Table of Contents
and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara’s common stock to be paid to the holders (other
than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares
(as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara’s common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 8, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory
services and its opinion for the information and assistance of Avalara’s board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. The
Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Avalara’s common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any
other matter. For additional information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.
LLC” and the full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.
Interests of Avalara’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger (see page 65)
When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, you should be aware that, aside from their interests
as Avalara shareholders, Avalara’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests
of Avalara shareholders generally. These interests are described in more detail below and, with respect to the named executive officers of Avalara,
are quantified in the “The Merger—Interests of Avalara’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger—280G Mitigation Actions—Quantification
of Potential Merger-Related Payments to Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 69.
With regard to our non-employee directors serving on the Board, these interests relate to the impact of the transaction on the directors’ outstanding
equity awards and the directors’ rights to indemnification pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.
With regard to our executive officers, these interests include the possible receipt of the following types of payments and benefits that may be
triggered by or otherwise relate to the merger, assuming the merger occurred on November 1, 2022 and, where applicable, the executives’ employment
was terminated by us without “cause” or, in some cases, by the executive for “good reason” (each as defined below) on such date:
•
the Company’s executive officers and directors hold equity-based awards that will be afforded the treatment described in the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Treatment of Avalara Equity Awards”;
•
the Company’s executive officers are party to existing employment and incentive agreements with the Company that provide for
severance benefits in the case of a qualifying termination of employment within specified periods following a change in control, which
will include completion of the merger; and
•
the Company’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage following the Merger
under the merger agreement. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification of
Directors and Officers and Insurance.”
Financing of the Merger (see page 71)
The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is not subject to any financing condition. It is anticipated that the total amount
of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at the closing of the
merger by Parent and Merger Sub under the merger agreement, will be approximately $10 billion in cash. Parent has obtained equity and debt
financing commitments for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the aggregate
7
Table of Contents
proceeds of which, together with cash on hand at Avalara, will be used by Parent to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all related fees and
expenses of Parent and Merger Sub and to finance the fundamental change offer for the Company’s outstanding convertible debt. These equity and
debt financing commitments will be funded through a combination of the following:
•
cash equity commitments by Vista Funds in an aggregate amount up to $3.875 billion on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the equity commitment letters. Additionally, certain institutional investors, severally and not jointly, have committed, pursuant
to separate equity commitment letters, an aggregate amount of $2.6 billion, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in each
equity commitment letter and as further described in the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger” beginning on page
71; and
•
debt financing commitments from the debt financing sources consisting of (1) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate
principal amount equal to $2.5 billion, and (2) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $250.0
million, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a commitment letter and as further described in the section
entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger” beginning on page 71.
Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 72)
Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (“HSR Act”), we cannot complete the merger until we have given
notification and furnished information to the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
“DOJ”), and until the applicable waiting period has expired or has been terminated. On August 22, 2022, Avalara and an affiliate of Vista each filed a
premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act, as a result of which the applicable waiting period would expire on September 21, 2022, at
11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, unless otherwise earlier terminated or extended by the antitrust authorities.
Generally under the merger agreement, each of Avalara and Parent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including (x) to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act and (y) to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals required under or in connection with any Antitrust Law (as defined in the
merger agreement) as soon as practicable, subject to certain limitations, as further described in “The Merger—Regulatory Clearances and Approvals
Required for the Merger” beginning on page 72.
While we have no reason to believe it will not be possible to obtain regulatory approvals, or to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, there is no
certainty that these approvals will be obtained.
Litigation Related to the Merger (see page 73)
Two purported Avalara shareholders have each filed a complaint relating to the merger in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The complaints, captioned James Albrecht v. Avalara, Inc., et al., No. 22-cv-7486 (filed September 1, 2022) and Ryan O’Dell v. Avalara, Inc., et
al., No. 22-cv-7720 (filed September 9, 2022), each names Avalara and its directors as defendants and alleges, among other things, that the
defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially false and misleading preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the merger in violation of
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek as relief, among other things, injunctive relief preventing defendants from filing a
definitive proxy statement and from consummating the merger unless additional disclosures are made, rescission of the merger in the event the
merger is consummated or awarding of rescissory damages, relief directing the defendants to account to plaintiffs for all damages suffered as a result
of the alleged violations, and an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees.

Table of Contents
Additionally, Avalara has received demand letters from purported Avalara shareholders seeking additional disclosures in the preliminary proxy
statement.
Avalara believes the claims asserted in the lawsuits and the demand letters are without merit. Additional lawsuits and demand letters arising out of
the merger may also be filed or received in the future.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 108)
The exchange of Avalara common stock for cash in the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may
also be taxable under state, local, or other tax laws. You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger” beginning on page 108 and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your
particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
Dissenters’ Rights (see page 74)
Under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, instead of receiving the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the merger
agreement, holders of Avalara’s common stock are entitled to dissent from and obtain payment of the fair value of their shares in cash together with
accrued interest from the effective time, if the merger is consummated. Any Avalara shareholder electing to dissent from the merger must strictly
comply with all procedures required under the WBCA. The procedures are summarized in “The Merger—Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 74
and a copy of the relevant statutory provisions is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.
ANY AVALARA SHAREHOLDER WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO
DO SO SHOULD REVIEW ANNEX C CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY AND SHOULD CONSULT THEIR LEGAL ADVISOR, SINCE
FAILURE TO TIMELY AND PROPERLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH THEREIN WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SUCH
RIGHTS.
Expected Timing of the Merger
Assuming timely receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions, we anticipate completing the merger in the second half
of 2022. However, the merger is subject to various regulatory clearances and approvals and other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside
of the control of Avalara or Parent could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time
between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required
clearances and approvals and the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the merger.
Acquisition Proposals (see page 88)
From August 8, 2022 until the effective time or, if earlier, the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, Avalara will not,
will cause its subsidiaries not to, and will direct and use reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:
•
initiate, solicit, or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to, or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants
and Agreements—Acquisition Proposals” beginning on page 88) or any inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to
lead to any Acquisition Proposal;
9
Table of Contents
•

13
Table of Contents
and expenses of any expert or consultant engaged by such party) together with interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment

date of such payment.
Specific Performance (see page 101)
The parties to the merger agreement are entitled (in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled in law or equity) to an injunction,

terms and provisions of the merger agreement.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance (see page 95)
Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the surviving corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six years from the
effective time the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Avalara (provided, that
Parent or the surviving corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less
advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time and from insurance carriers
having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to the
merger agreement, Parent and the surviving corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by
Avalara for coverage for its last full fiscal year prior to August 8, 2022, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable
for such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Avalara shall purchase from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, no later than the
effective time, a six-year prepaid “tail policy” providing at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the persons covered by the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and the insureds covered by the current
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Avalara and its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before
the effective time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, and from insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with
respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance; provided, however, that in no event shall the amount paid for such prepaid policies exceed
350% of the Current Premium. In the event Avalara elects to purchase such a “tail policy,” the surviving corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
surviving corporation to) maintain such “tail policy” in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder. Parent
agrees to honor and perform under, and to cause the surviving corporation to honor and perform under, all indemnification agreements entered into
by Avalara or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party which are set forth in Avalara’s disclosure letter and made available to Parent prior
to the date of the merger agreement. Parent has agreed to honor and perform under, and to cause the surviving corporation to honor and perform
under, all indemnification agreements entered into by Avalara or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party which are in effect as of the date
of the merger agreement.
Delisting and Deregistration of Avalara Common Stock (see page 74)
As promptly as reasonably practicable following the completion of the merger, Avalara common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and
deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Thereafter, we will no longer be required to file periodic
reports with the SEC with respect to Avalara common stock.

The following are brief answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the merger, the special meeting and the proposals being considered
at the special meeting. We urge you to carefully read the remainder of this proxy statement because the information in this section does not provide all
the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger and the special meeting. Additional important information is also contained
in the annexes attached to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.
Q.
Why am I receiving these proxy materials?
A.
On August 8, 2022, Avalara entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Avalara, pursuant to which
Avalara will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation
by the Board of proxies from Avalara shareholders to vote in favor of the merger proposal and the other matters to be voted on at the special
meeting.
Q.
What is the proposed transaction?
A.
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of Avalara by Parent by way of merger of Merger Sub with and into Avalara. If the merger proposal is
approved by Avalara shareholders and the other conditions to the consummation of the merger contained in the merger agreement are satisfied or
(to the extent permitted) waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Avalara. Avalara will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will be
privately held as a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. If the merger is consummated, each share of Avalara common stock will
automatically be cancelled and you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.
Q.
What will I receive in the merger if it is completed?
A.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, if the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $93.50 in cash, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Avalara common stock you own (unless you have properly exercised and perfected and not forfeited
or withdrawn your dissenters’ rights under Washington law with respect to such shares). For example, if you own 100 shares of Avalara common
stock, you will be entitled to receive $9,350 in cash in exchange for your shares, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest. You will
not be entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Parent.
Q.
Where and when is the special meeting, and who may attend?
A.
The special meeting will be held virtually on October 14, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. Only holders of record of Avalara common stock as of
September 8, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, or their legal proxy holders may attend and participate in the special meeting or any
adjournments or postponements thereof. You will be able to attend the meeting by visiting www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm, where you will
be able to listen to the special meeting, submit questions, and vote. To participate in the special meeting, you must pre-register at
www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm by 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time on Thursday, October 13, 2022. You will not be able to attend the meeting in
person. For purposes of attendance at the special meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present in person” or “in person” shall mean
virtually present at the special meeting.
Q.
Who can vote at the special meeting?
A.
All Avalara shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 8, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive
notice of, attend and vote at the special meeting, or any adjournment
15Table of Contents
or postponement thereof. Each share of Avalara common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the meeting. At the close of
business on the record date, there were 88,557,882 shares of Avalara common stock issued and outstanding.
Q.
What matters will be voted on at the special meeting?
A.
At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
the merger proposal;
•
the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal; and
•
the adjournment proposal.
Q.
How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
A.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote:
•
“FOR” the merger proposal;
•
“FOR” the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal; and
•
“FOR” the adjournment proposal.
Q.
What vote is required to approve the merger proposal?
A.
The merger proposal will be approved if the holders of a majority of all of the outstanding shares of Avalara common stock entitled to vote thereon
approve the merger proposal.
Q.
What vote is required to approve the other proposals?
A.
Approval of each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal requires that the
number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of votes “AGAINST” the proposal. If no quorum is present at
the special meeting, the meeting may nonetheless be adjourned by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares of
Avalara common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter.
Q.
How are Avalara’s directors and executives intending to vote?
A.
As of September 8, 2022, the directors and executive officers of Avalara either directly or through their affiliates, collectively, beneficially owned and
were entitled to vote 1,421,237 shares of Avalara common stock, representing approximately 1.6% of the shares of Avalara common stock
outstanding on that date. Avalara currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote such shares of Avalara common stock in
favor of the foregoing proposals, although none of them has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so.
Q.
What factors did the Board consider in deciding to enter into the merger agreement and recommending the approval of the merger proposal, the
named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal?
A.
In reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and to recommend that our
shareholders approve the merger proposal, the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal, and the adjournment
proposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of the proposed merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, as well as other alternatives. For a more detailed description of these
factors, see “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 46.
16
Table of Contents
Q.
Do you expect the merger to be taxable to Avalara shareholders?
A.
The exchange of Avalara common stock for cash in the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may
also be taxable under state, local, or other tax laws. You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger” beginning on page 108 and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your
particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
Q.
What other effects will the merger have on Avalara?
A.
If the merger is completed, Avalara common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Avalara will no
longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to Avalara common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules,
and regulations. Following the completion of the merger, Avalara common stock will no longer be publicly traded and you will no longer have any
interest in Avalara’s future earnings or growth; each share of Avalara common stock you hold will represent only the right to receive $93.50 in cash,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q.
When is the merger expected to be completed?
A.
Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by our shareholders of the merger proposal, the parties to the
merger agreement expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2022. However, Avalara cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at
all. Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of shareholder approval of the merger proposal and the receipt of
certain regulatory approvals, the exact timing of the merger cannot be determined at this time and we cannot guarantee that the merger will be
completed.
Q.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A.
If the merger proposal is not approved by Avalara shareholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Avalara shareholders will
not receive any payment for their shares of Avalara common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Avalara will remain an independent
public company and shares of Avalara common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and
we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee upon the
termination of $242.329 million or Parent may be required to pay Avalara a termination fee of $484.659 million, as described under “The Merger
Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on page 100.
Q.
Do any of Avalara’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests as a shareholder?
A.
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive
officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. The Board was aware of
and considered these differing interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the
merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that the merger agreement be approved by Avalara shareholders. See “The Merger—
Interests of Avalara’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger” beginning on page 65.
Q.
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal?
A.
The SEC rules require Avalara to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that will or may be made to
Avalara’s named executive officers in connection with the merger.
17
Table of Contents
Approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal is not required to complete the merger.
Q.
Who is soliciting my vote?
A.
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and Avalara will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree has been retained to assist with the solicitation of
proxies. Avalara will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $45,000 and will reimburse Innisfree for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these
and related services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also
be distributed through brokers, banks, or other nominees to beneficial owners of shares of Avalara common stock, in which case these parties will
be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or
other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of Avalara’s directors, officers, and employees.
Q.
What do I need to do now?
A.
Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including the attached annexes,
including, but not limited to, the merger agreement along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain
important information about, among other things, the merger and how it affects shareholders. Whether or not you expect to attend the virtual
special meeting in person, please submit a proxy (or provide instructions to your bank, broker, or other nominee, as applicable) to vote your shares
as promptly as possible to ensure that your shares will be represented and voted at the special meeting.
Q.
How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?
A.
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent (American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC), you are considered a
“shareholder of record” and you may:
•
Vote in person—shareholders who virtually attend the special meeting may vote electronically at the special meeting, which will revoke any
proxy previously submitted;
•
Vote through the internet—in order to do so, please follow the instructions shown on your enclosed proxy card;
•
Vote by telephone-in order to do so, please follow the instructions shown on your enclosed proxy card; or
•
Vote by mail—if you request or receive a paper proxy card by mail, simply complete, sign, and date the enclosed proxy card and promptly
return it in the postage-paid envelope provided or, if the envelope is missing, please mail your completed proxy card to Avalara, Inc., c/o
Innisfree M&A Incorporated, 20 Oser Avenue, Suite 100, Hauppauge, NY 11788. Your completed, signed, and dated proxy card must be
received prior to the special meeting.
Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to submit a proxy to vote to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the
meeting and vote virtually if you have already submitted a proxy. Please choose only one method to cast your vote by proxy. We encourage you to
vote by submitting a proxy over the internet or by telephone, which are convenient, cost-effective, and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy
card by mail. If you return your signed proxy card to us or vote by submitting your proxy over the internet or by telephone before the special
meeting, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, we will vote your shares as you direct in such proxy.
If you return an executed proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote with regard to a particular proposal, your shares of Avalara common
stock will be voted “FOR” such proposal.

Table of Contents
Q.
How do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker, bank, or other nominee?
A.
If your shares are held by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and you will
receive a voting instruction form from your broker, bank, or other nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted. If
you are a beneficial owner of shares held by a broker, bank, or other nominee and you wish to vote in person at the virtual special meeting, you
must obtain a legal proxy, in PDF or Image (gif, jpg, or png) file format, from the broker, bank, or other nominee that holds your shares issued in your
name, authorizing you to vote in person at the virtual special meeting.
Q.
Can I change or revoke my proxy after it has been submitted?
A.
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the special meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you
may change or revoke your proxy by:
•
submitting another proxy over the internet or by telephone for shares held directly;
•
timely delivering a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to our Corporate Secretary;
•
timely delivering a valid, later-dated proxy by mail; or
•
attending the special meeting and voting virtually. Simply attending the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank, or other
nominee to change or revoke your voting instructions provided to such broker, bank, or other nominee.
Q.
How many shares of Avalara common stock must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?
A.
The presence at the special meeting, in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy, of a majority of the voting power of shares of Avalara
common stock issued and outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum. There must be a
quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the shareholders holding a majority in
voting power of shares of Avalara common stock, present in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote at the special
meeting, may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date, or time. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an
adjournment or postponement of the special meeting and may subject Avalara to additional expense. As of the close of business on the record
date, there were 88,557,882 shares of Avalara common stock outstanding. Accordingly, 44,278,942 shares of Avalara common stock must be present
or represented by proxy at the special meeting to constitute a quorum. If you submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the
Internet or by telephone, or submit a ballot virtually at the special meeting (regardless of whether you indicate how you wish to vote), your shares
of Avalara common stock will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
Q.
What if I abstain from voting on any proposal? What if I do not vote?
A.
For the merger proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST,” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will not count as votes cast for or against the merger
proposal, but will still count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However, the vote to approve the merger proposal is
based on the total number of shares of Avalara common stock outstanding on the record date. As a result, if you abstain, or if you fail to vote (or
submit voting instructions to your bank, broker, or other nominee, in the case of “street name” shares), it will have the same effect as if you vote
“AGAINST” the approval of the merger agreement.
For the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST,”
or “ABSTAIN.” Each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal requires that
the number of votes cast
19
Table of Contents
“FOR” the proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of votes “AGAINST” the proposal. As a result, abstentions will not be considered a
vote cast on the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal and will have no effect on
the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present). If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker,
or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Avalara common stock will result in such shares not being counted for purposes of determining
the presence of a quorum and will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal or
the adjournment proposal. Shareholders should note, however, that the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal is
advisory in nature, and the results of that vote will not affect the compensation that would, or may, be payable to the named executive officer in
connection with the merger.
Q.
Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or over the internet or by telephone or in person at the virtual special meeting?
A.
If you are a shareholder of record and you do not attend the special meeting or sign and return your proxy card, or vote by submitting your proxy
over the internet or by telephone, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted as present for purposes of
determining whether a quorum exists. The failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares at the special meeting will have no effect
on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal. However, the vote to
approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of Avalara common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record
date. As a result, if you fail to return your proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
merger proposal.
Q.
What is a broker non-vote? If I hold my shares in “street name,” will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my shares for me on the proposals
to be considered at the special meeting?
A.
Broker non-votes involve shares held in “street name” by brokers, banks, and other nominees that are present or represented by proxy at the
special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank, or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote
on a particular proposal and such broker, bank, or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Under NYSE rules, brokers,
banks, and other nominees holding shares in “street name” do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals
described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, if a beneficial owner of shares of Avalara common stock held in “street name” does not give voting
instructions to the broker, bank, or other nominee with respect to at least one of the three proposals, then those shares will not be counted as
present in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy at the special meeting (including for purposes of determining a quorum). Because all
three proposals are non-discretionary matters, it is not expected that there will be any broker non-votes at the special meeting; however, it is
possible that a broker non-vote could occur with respect to one or more of the proposals to the extent that voting instructions are given to a broker,
bank, or other nominee with respect to at least one but less than all of the proposals. Because the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on
the total number of shares of Avalara common stock outstanding on the record date, if you fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank, or
other nominee or if a broker non-vote occurs with respect to the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger
proposal. To the extent that you fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee or a broker non-vote occurs with respect to
the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the outcome of
such proposals because it will not be considered a vote cast on such matters.
Q.
Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
A.
No. Because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than any shares you hold of record,
any shares held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes
20
Table of Contents
with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust, or as
custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different
form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an
individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.
Q.
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
A.
If your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction form.
Please complete and return all of the proxy cards or voting instruction forms you receive (or submit each of your proxies over the internet or by
telephone) to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
Q.
Am I entitled to exercise dissenters’ rights under the WBCA instead of receiving the per share merger consideration for my shares of Avalara
common stock?
A.
Yes. Holders of Company common stock are entitled to assert dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger. For additional information, please
see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 74.
Q.
How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Avalara common stock prior to the last trading day prior to media reports
speculating on the proposed merger with Parent? How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Avalara common stock as of
a recent trading date?
A.
The merger consideration of $93.50 per share represents a 27.1% premium over the closing price of $73.54 per share of Avalara common stock on
July 6, 2022, the last trading day prior to media reports speculating on the proposed merger. On September 9, 2022, the last practicable day before
the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price of Avalara common stock on the NYSE was $91.99 per share. You are encouraged to obtain
current market quotations for Avalara common stock.
Q.
What happens if I sell my shares of Avalara common stock before the completion of the merger?
A.
If you transfer your shares of Avalara common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger or to
demand dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger. In order to receive the merger consideration or to exercise dissenters’ rights in connection
with the merger, you must hold your shares of Avalara common stock through the effective time. The record date for shareholders entitled to vote
at the special meeting is earlier than the date the merger is anticipated to be consummated. Accordingly, if you sell or transfer your shares of
Avalara common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made
between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares, and each of you (the transferor and the transferee) notifies
Avalara in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration, if the merger is consummated, to the
person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of Avalara common stock, but you will have retained your right to vote these shares at the special
meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Avalara common stock after the record date, we encourage you to complete, date,
sign, and return the enclosed proxy card or vote via the Internet or by telephone.
Q.
What is a proxy?
A.
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Avalara common stock. The written document
describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special
21
Table of Contents
meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Avalara common stock is called a “proxy
card.” The Board has designated Scott McFarlane, Avalara’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Alesia Pinney, Avalara’s Executive Vice
President, Chief Legal Officer, and Secretary, as proxies for the special meeting.
Q.
If a shareholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A.
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way
that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted
“FOR” or “AGAINST” or to abstain from voting on all, some, or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting. If you
properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your
properly signed proxy will be voted (i) “FOR” the merger proposal; (ii) “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory
proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
Q.
Who will count the votes obtained at the special meeting?
A.
The votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the special meeting.
Q.
When will Avalara announce the voting results of the special meeting, and where can I find the voting results?
A.
Avalara intends to announce the preliminary voting results at the special meeting and will report the final voting results of the special meeting in a
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the special meeting. All reports that Avalara files with the SEC are
publicly available when filed.
Q:
Who can help answer my other questions?
A:

statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Innisfree, which is acting as the proxy solicitation agent for Avalara in connection with the
merger, or us.

The proxy statement and the attached annexes contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained herein, including statements
regarding statements regarding our expectations regarding the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and other future performance and
financial results of the business and other non-historical statements, are forward-looking statements. In some cases you can identify forward-looking
statements because they contain words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “continues,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “might,”
“plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “see,” “goal,” “forecast,” “targets,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. We
have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current plans, expectations, and projections about future events and financial trends that we
believe may affect our results of operations, financial condition, business, strategies, financial needs, and the plans and objectives of management. Our
actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. Forward-looking statements are based on information available to our management
as of the date of this report and our management’s good faith belief as of such date with respect to future events and are subject to a number of risks,
uncertainties, and assumptions, which are, in many instances, beyond our control, that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from
those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in
forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement;
•
the failure to obtain approval of the proposed transaction by our shareholders;
•
the failure to obtain required regulatory approval to the completion of the proposed transaction or the failure to satisfy any of the other
conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant
approval for the consummation of the proposed merger;
•
the risk that the proposed merger will not be consummated in a timely manner, including if the debt and equity financing for the proposed
transaction is not funded in accordance with their respective terms;
•
the effect of the announcement of the proposed transaction on our ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with
its key business partners and customers, and others with whom it does business, or on its operating results and businesses generally;
•
the response of competitors to the proposed transaction;
•
risks associated with the disruption of management’s attention from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction;
•
the ability to meet expectations regarding the timing and completion of the proposed transaction;
•
significant costs associated with the proposed transaction;
•
potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction; and
•
restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.
Other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially include those set forth in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022, and subsequent reports
filed with the SEC, as well as other documents that may be filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC. See the section of

this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.” You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements and
you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-
looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-
looking statements. The forward-looking statements made in this report speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update
any forward-looking statements made in this report to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect new information or the
occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that
we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material factors that are important to you. New risk factors emerge
from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-
looking statements. In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this proxy statement, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable
basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an
exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned
not to unduly rely upon these statements.

THE SPECIAL MEETING",34,35
"AVALARA, INC._20220912_DEFM14A_20334857_4516123.Pdf",THE SPECIAL MEETING,"THE SPECIAL MEETING
This proxy statement is being provided to Avalara shareholders as part of a solicitation by the Board of proxies for use at the special meeting to be held
at the time and place specified below, and at any properly convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.
Date, Time, and Place
The special meeting of Avalara shareholders (the “special meeting”) is scheduled to be held virtually on October 14, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The
special meeting will be a virtual meeting of shareholders. Only holders of record of Avalara common stock of September 8, 2022, the record date for the
special meeting, or their legal proxy holders may attend and participate in the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. You will be
able to attend the special meeting by visiting www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm, where you will be able to listen to the special meeting, submit
questions, and vote. To participate in the special meeting, you must pre-register at www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm by 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time on
Thursday, October 13, 2022. You will not be able to attend the meeting in person.
Purpose of the Special Meeting
At the special meeting, Avalara shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
the merger proposal, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger,” “The Merger Agreement,” and “Merger Proposal
(Proposal 1)” beginning on pages 32, 78, and 103, respectively;
•
the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal, which approval shall be on a non-binding, advisory basis, as
further discussed under “The Merger—Interests of Avalara’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger” and “Advisory Vote on
Named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal (Proposal 2)” beginning on pages 65 and 104, respectively; and
•
the adjournment proposal, as further described under “Adjournment Proposal (Proposal 3)” beginning on page 105.
Avalara shareholders must approve the merger proposal as a condition to the completion of the merger. If Avalara shareholders fail to approve the merger
proposal, the merger will not occur. The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal is a vote separate and apart
from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Accordingly, a shareholder may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the named
executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related
compensation advisory proposal is only advisory in nature, it will not be binding on Avalara, Parent, Merger Sub, or the surviving corporation.
Accordingly, because Avalara is contractually obligated to pay such merger-related compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, if the merger proposal is approved and the closing of the merger occurs, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.
Recommendation of the Avalara Board of Directors
The Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Avalara and Avalara shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the
merger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger in accordance with the WBCA, (ii) adopted the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, in accordance with WBCA and (iii) adopted a resolution recommending the merger agreement be
approved by Avalara shareholders. A description of factors considered by the Board in reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement and declare it
advisable to enter the merger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub can be found in “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the
Merger” beginning on page 46.
26Table of Contents
The Board unanimously recommends that Avalara shareholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related
compensation advisory proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
The merger proposal must be approved as a condition for the merger to occur. If Avalara shareholders fail to approve the merger proposal by the requisite
vote, the merger will not occur.
Record Date; Shareholders Entitled to Vote
Only holders of Avalara common stock at the close of business on September 8, 2022, the record date for the special meeting (the “record date”), will be
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. A list of shareholders entitled to
vote at the special meeting will be available at the virtual special meeting website during the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date,
88,557,882 shares of Avalara common stock were issued and outstanding.
Holders of Avalara common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Avalara common stock they own at the close of business on the record date.
Shareholder List
For at least 10 days prior to the special meeting, a complete list of shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for examination by
any shareholder, for any purpose germane to the special meeting, during ordinary business hours at our principal office at 255 South King Street, Suite
1800, Seattle, Washington 98104. If you would like to view the shareholder list, please contact our Investor Relations department in advance at
investor@avalara.com. The list will be available during the entire time of the special meeting.
Quorum
The presence at the special meeting, in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares of
Avalara common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote at the meeting will constitute a quorum.
Shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting may participate in the meeting by remote communication. To participate in the special meeting, you
must pre-register at www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm by 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time on Thursday, October 13, 2022. Actual attendance at the virtual
special meeting is not required in order to be counted for purposes of determining a quorum if voting by proxy. There must be a quorum for business to
be conducted at the special meeting. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the shareholders holding a majority in voting power of shares of
Avalara common stock, present in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting, may adjourn the special
meeting to another place, date, or time. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement of
the special meeting and may subject Avalara to additional expense.
If you submit a properly executed proxy card or submit your proxy over the internet or by telephone, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be
counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to
instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Avalara common stock will result in such shares not being counted for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
Required Vote
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares of Avalara common stock
issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote thereon.
27
Table of Contents
Approval of each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal requires that the number
of votes cast “FOR” the proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of votes “AGAINST” the proposal.
Abstentions
An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy, but abstains from voting by
marking “ABSTAIN” on such holder’s ballot or proxy.
Abstentions will not count as votes cast for or against the merger proposal, but will still count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is
present. However, the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of Avalara common stock outstanding on the record
date. As a result, if you abstain, it will have the same effect as if you vote “AGAINST” the approval of the merger agreement.
Each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal requires for its approval that the
number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of votes “AGAINST” the proposal. As a result, abstentions will not
be considered a vote cast on the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal and will
therefore have no effect on the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present).
If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including no instruction to abstain from voting) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the
proxy will be voted “FOR” (i) approval of the merger proposal, (ii) approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory
proposal, and (iii) approval of the adjournment proposal.
Failure to Vote and Broker Non-Votes
The proposal to approve the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Avalara common
stock entitled to vote on such matter. Therefore, the failure to vote or the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve the merger agreement.
The approval of the named executive officer related compensation advisory proposal requires that the number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal at the
special meeting exceeds the number of votes “AGAINST” the proposal. Consequently, the abstention from voting will not be considered a vote cast on
the proposal and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the compensation advisory proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
The proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate requires that the number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal at
the special meeting exceeds the number of votes “AGAINST” the proposal. Consequently, the abstention from voting will not be considered a vote cast
on the proposal and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special
meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares having voting power present at the virtual special meeting or represented by proxy at the special
meeting may adjourn the meeting to another place, date, or time. In such case, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the proposal.
Under applicable stock exchange rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the
special meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker, trust, or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker,
trust, or other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares
on a particular proposal, but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if your shares are held in “street name,”
your bank, broker, trust, or other nominee will NOT be
28
Table of Contents
able to vote your shares of Avalara common stock on any of the proposals, and your shares will not be counted as present in determining the presence of
a quorum, unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust, or other nominee on how to vote. Because the proposal to approve the merger
agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Avalara common stock, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust, or
other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement. Because the
approval of each of (i) the named executive officer merger related compensation advisory proposal, and (ii) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting
from time to time if necessary or appropriate requires that the number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of
votes “AGAINST” the proposal, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal,
the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust, or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on approval of each such proposal.
Voting by Avalara’s Directors and Executive Officers
At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of Avalara and their affiliates were entitled to vote 1,421,237 shares of
Avalara common stock, or approximately 1.6% of the shares of Avalara common stock issued and outstanding on that date. Avalara’s directors and
executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote their shares in favor of the merger proposal and the other proposals to be considered at the
special meeting, although none of Avalara’s directors and executive officers is obligated to do so.

“shareholder of record.” If you are a shareholder of record, there are four methods by which you may vote your shares or have your shares voted at the
special meeting. You may attend the special meeting and vote your shares in person at the virtual special meeting, or you may cause your shares to be
voted by authorizing the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares at the special meeting by returning the executed proxy card by
mail or by voting through the internet or by telephone. If you choose to submit a proxy to vote your shares over the internet or by telephone, there is no
need for you to mail back your proxy card. Although Avalara offers four different voting methods, Avalara encourages you to submit a proxy to vote over
the internet or by telephone to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, you may:
•

Vote through the internet—in order to do so, please follow the instructions shown on your proxy card;
•
Vote by telephone—in order to do so, please follow the instructions shown on your enclosed proxy card; or

proxy card and promptly return it in the postage-paid envelope provided or, if the envelope is missing, please mail your completed proxy
card to Avalara, Inc., c/o Innisfree M&A Incorporated, 20 Oser Avenue, Suite 100, Hauppauge, NY 11788. Your completed, signed, and dated
proxy card must be received prior to the special meeting.
If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the “beneficial owner” of shares
held in “street name.” The organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the special meeting. As a
beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. Proxy materials, including a voting
instruction form, should be forwarded to you by that organization. If you are not the shareholder of record, you must register in advance to participate in
the special meeting virtually over the internet by going to the website www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm. To register to attend and vote in person at
the special meeting virtually you must obtain a legal proxy, in PDF or Image (gif, jpg, or png) file format, from your broker, bank, or other nominee,

Revocation of Proxies
You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the special meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may revoke
your proxy by:
•
submitting another proxy over the internet or by telephone for shares held directly;
•
timely delivering a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to our Corporate Secretary at Avalara, Inc., 255 South King Street, Suite
1800, Seattle, Washington 98104;
•
timely delivering a valid, later-dated proxy by mail; or
•
attending the special meeting and voting in person during the virtual special meeting.
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described above will not
in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to Avalara or by sending a written notice of
revocation to Avalara, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by
Avalara before the special meeting. Please note that to be effective, your new proxy card, Internet or telephone instructions or written notice of
revocation must be received by our Corporate Secretary prior to the special meeting and, in the case of Internet or telephone voting instructions, must be
received prior to the proxy being exercised at the special meeting for shares held directly.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” you should contact your broker, bank, or other nominee with questions about how to
change or revoke your voting instructions.
Solicitation of Proxies
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and Avalara will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies.
Avalara will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $45,000 and will reimburse Innisfree for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and related
services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed
through brokers, banks, and other nominees to the beneficial owners of shares of Avalara common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed
for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium
by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of Avalara’s directors, officers, and employees.
Adjournments and Postponements
In addition to the merger proposal and the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal, Avalara shareholders are also being
asked to approve the adjournment proposal, which will enable the adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in
favor of the merger proposal
30
Table of Contents
if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
accompanying proxy statement is timely provided to Avalara shareholders. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the shareholders holding a
majority in voting power of the shares of Avalara common stock, present in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote at the
special meeting, may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date, or time. If a quorum is present, then the number of votes cast “FOR” the
adjournment proposal must exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the adjournment proposal. The special meeting could
be postponed before it commences. If you return a signed proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will
be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. In addition, the Board could postpone the special meeting before it commences. If the special meeting is
adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies, shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior
to their use at the special meeting as adjourned or postponed.
The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.

Effects on Avalara If the Merger Is Not Completed",41,42
"AVALARA, INC._20220912_DEFM14A_20334857_4516123.Pdf",Effects on Avalara if the Merger Is Not Completed,"Effects on Avalara If the Merger Is Not Completed
If the merger proposal is not approved by Avalara shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Avalara shareholders will not
receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, Avalara will remain an independent public company and shares of Avalara
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with
the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, Avalara expects that management will operate Avalara’s business in a manner similar to that in which
it is being operated today and that Avalara shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently
subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Avalara operates and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be completed, it is likely that
the price of Avalara’s common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Avalara’s common stock
would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement. Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance
as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of Avalara’s common stock.
Further, if the merger agreement is validly terminated under certain specified circumstances, Avalara may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of
$242.329 million or Parent may be required to pay Avalara a termination fee of $484.659 million. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”
beginning on page 100 for a discussion of the circumstances under which such fee may be payable.",42,42

The Board and Avalara’s senior management, together with their legal and financial advisors, regularly review and assess Avalara’s operations and
financial performance, industry conditions and related developments as they may impact Avalara’s long-term strategic plans, direction and objectives.
These reviews and assessments have also included consideration of various potential strategic opportunities to enhance shareholder value, including
continuing as a standalone company, acquisitions of other companies or businesses in the industries in, or adjacent to, which Avalara operates and other
potential strategic alternatives.
Avalara has had a longstanding relationship with Goldman Sachs, and in connection with these reviews, Goldman Sachs has periodically met with the
Board and Avalara’s senior management to review Avalara’s financial performance, the performance of other companies in the industries in which Avalara
operates and other market and industry developments and advise Avalara with respect to strategic opportunities and alternatives. Avalara selected
Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed transaction based on Goldman Sachs’s experience in transactions similar to
the proposed transaction, qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of Avalara and its business and the industries in which Avalara
conducts its business. Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and other transactions, as well as for corporate initiatives
and other purposes.

On January 25 and 26, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management. In addition
to other ordinary course matters, members of Avalara’s senior management reviewed with the Board Avalara’s financial performance in fiscal year 2021, a
budget and forecast for fiscal year 2022, opportunities and challenges for Avalara’s foreign operations centered in Europe, including challenges as a
result of Avalara relying on a limited number of partners, including a large European marketplace partner we refer to as Partner A, and having only
recently started to provide e-invoicing services in Europe in 2021, which services Avalara’s senior management believed needed to be expanded in order
to compete internationally against other companies in the industries in, or adjacent to, which Avalara operates, some of which had significantly more
advanced e-invoicing services. Members of Avalara’s senior management also reviewed with the Board potential acquisitions, including the potential
acquisition of a foreign company that is referred to herein as Company A that has a developed e-invoicing business, which had been previously
discussed with the Board and had been under review by Avalara’s senior management since late 2021, during which time members of Company A’s senior
management had repeatedly informed Avalara’s senior management that Company A was not interested in a potential transaction, including because
Company A did not expect that Avalara would be able to offer a sufficiently high valuation that would be of interest to Company A’s board of directors.
Members of Avalara’s senior management presented their views to the Board that, given the need to quickly develop Avalara’s e-invoicing capabilities,
which was a significant aspect of Avalara’s international strategy, Company A was a priority for a potential acquisition.
In March and April 2022, members of Avalara’s senior management received separate calls from representatives of private equity firms referred to herein
as Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D. On these calls, the representatives of the private equity firms separately expressed their interest in Avalara, their
desire to learn more about Avalara’s business and their willingness to participate in potential strategic alternatives ranging in various cases from a
minority investment, including in connection with potential acquisitions of other companies in, or adjacent to, the industries in which Avalara operates, to
an acquisition of Avalara. None of these calls included any discussion of the financial or other terms of a potential transaction involving Avalara.
Also in April 2022, members of Avalara’s senior management provided the Board with an email update regarding a potential acquisition of Company A.
As previously discussed with the Board, including at its January 25 and 26, 2022 meeting, members of Avalara’s senior management believed that
acquiring Company A would be an important part of expanding and accelerating Avalara’s e-invoicing business, which would be a significant aspect of
Avalara’s international strategy to help achieve Avalara’s overall strategic plan. Since the Board’s January 25 and 26, 2022 meeting, Partner A had decided
to again seek to modify the pricing terms under its commercial relationship with Avalara and decrease the price that would be paid for Avalara’s services,
which, if accepted by Avalara, was expected to reduce Avalara’s revenue and margins in Europe. As a result, Avalara’s senior management had begun to
reevaluate its business relationship with Partner A and had expressed their views to the Board that advancing Avalara’s international strategy had
become even more important.
On April 18, 2022, Avalara submitted an indication of interest to acquire Company A. On April 22, 2022, by unanimous written consent, the Board
authorized the engagement of Goldman Sachs to act as a financial advisor with respect the potential acquisition of Company A. As the acquisition of
Company A would be the largest transaction undertaken by Avalara since its formation, Avalara’s senior management asked that Goldman Sachs provide
the Board with a presentation on Avalara’s historical financial performance, current market conditions, the expectations of public equity analysts of
Avalara’s future performance, the potential effect of an acquisition of Company A on Avalara’s financial performance and other strategic alternatives,
including the potential acquisition of other companies in the industries in, or adjacent to, which Avalara operates, one of which we refer to herein as
Company B and another of which we refer to herein as Company C, or a potential sale of Avalara. Following Avalara’s submission of an indication of
interest to acquire Company A, members of Avalara’s senior management continued to contact members of Company A’s senior management and the
chairman of Company A’s board of directors to express interest in a potential transaction.
On April 26 and 27, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management and, for a
portion of such meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs in
34
Table of Contents
attendance. In addition to other ordinary course matters, members of Avalara’s senior management reviewed with the Board Avalara’s performance in the
first quarter of 2022 and discussed certain challenges that were affecting Avalara’s business and operations, including a reduction in the growth of new
bookings as a result of weakness in Avalara’s international business and the reduction in revenue attributable to Partner A due to lower volumes and an
expected decrease in contract pricing, which was expected to be reduced further, and, in light of the lower associated profit margins, members of Avalara’s
senior management were contemplating potentially winding down Avalara’s relationship with Partner A. Other challenges included slower than expected
growth in both new bookings and upsell bookings as a result of sales and marketing capacity issues and other operational challenges, including weak
growth in marketing demand generation and other operational weaknesses that could affect Avalara’s remaining fiscal year 2022 performance. Members of
Avalara’s senior management also reviewed with the Board an updated long-term forecast for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 and discussed the
opportunities and challenges in achieving the long-term forecast, as well as the potential acquisitions of Company A, Company B and Company C.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board the historical financial performance of Avalara, current market conditions, the expectations of
public equity analysts of Avalara’s future performance, the potential effect of an acquisition of Company A on Avalara’s financial performance, including
the potential negative impact on Avalara’s market value given the proposed valuation in its indication of interest, and other strategic alternatives,
including the potential acquisition of Company B or Company C or a potential sale of Avalara. With respect to a potential sale of Avalara, representatives
of Goldman Sachs provided the Board their views as to the potential bidders that would likely have both the interest and financial capability to engage in
a potential acquisition of Avalara, as well as the risks and benefits of reaching out to multiple potential bidders. Representatives of Goldman Sachs
highlighted both financial investors, with an emphasis on financial investors with a history of engaging in large transactions in the software and
technology industries (including Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D), as well as strategic buyers, noting potential interest, financial capability and
potential impediments or challenges associated with such parties pursuing a potential acquisition of Avalara. With respect to the potential strategic
buyers highlighted by Goldman Sachs, many of which were current partners of Avalara, members of Avalara’s senior management believed that those
potential strategic buyers would not be interested in acquiring Avalara because Avalara’s strategy is centered around being platform-agnostic and
involves integrating Avalara’s products and services into the platforms of many different partners who compete with others, such that a potential
acquisition of Avalara by a strategic buyer could result in a significant loss of customers because other partners could cease to integrate Avalara’s
products and services into their respective platforms. Additionally, members of Avalara’s management had not been contacted by any strategic parties
regarding a potential acquisition of Avalara since outreach from a single strategic party at the time of Avalara’s initial public offering in 2018.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs expressed their views that, if the Board were to explore a potential sale, that it would be beneficial to commence
discussions with financial investors with a history of engaging in large transactions in the software and technology industries, including Party A, Party
B, Party C, Party D, another private equity firm referred to herein as Party E and Vista, given their higher likelihood of interest and ability to obtain the
financing that would be necessary to acquire Avalara. Following discussion, including of the operational and market challenges facing Avalara’s
business, the declining revenue in Avalara’s international businesses and challenges in competing in Europe against other companies with more
advanced products, the potential negative impacts on Avalara’s valuation if it were to pursue an acquisition of Company A or another company that
would likely be necessary for Avalara to execute on its strategic plan and the deterioration of market conditions resulting in lower valuation multiples
across the industries in which Avalara operates, the Board directed members of Avalara’s senior management, together with representatives of Goldman
Sachs, to begin exploring a potential sale with a targeted group of financial investors with a history of engaging in large transactions in the software and
technology industries to help the Board better assess Avalara’s valuation in a potential sale transaction and, therefore, the relative desirability of that
particular strategic alternative.
Over the course of the following weeks, members of Avalara’s senior management worked with representatives of Goldman Sachs to prepare for the
potential sale process as directed by the Board and provided the Board with email updates on, among other topics, discussions with Company A and the
status of the potential sale process. During this time, members of Avalara’s senior management also reviewed with a majority of the
35
Table of Contents
members of the Board the terms of a potential engagement of Goldman Sachs to act as financial advisor with respect to the potential sale process, all of
whom were supportive of such engagement. In addition, members of Avalara’s senior management prepared certain forecasts for fiscal years 2022
through 2025, which we refer to as the “May Projections” (discussed further in the section entitled “Financial Projections” beginning on page 62 of this
proxy statement), that were the same as the forecasts reviewed with the Board at its April 26 and 27, 2022 meeting except for an increase in the projected
free cash flow.
On May 3, 2022, representatives of Party E contacted members of Avalara’s senior management to express their interest in Avalara, their desire to learn
more about Avalara’s business and their willingness to participate in potential strategic alternatives.
On May 13, 2022, a representative of Vista contacted a member of Avalara’s board of directors to express its interest in Avalara and its desire to learn more
about Avalara’s business.
On May 19, 2022, on behalf of Avalara and consistent with the Board’s directives to explore a potential sale through an organized competitive process
with a targeted group of financial investors, representatives of Goldman Sachs began outreach to seven parties—Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party
E, Vista and an additional private equity firm referred to as Party F. Over the course of the potential sale process, over 10 parties were either contacted by
Avalara or had reached out to Avalara regarding a potential transaction involving Avalara.
Avalara or had reached out to Avalara regarding a potential transaction involving Avalara.
On May 20, 2022, Avalara formally engaged Goldman Sachs to act as financial advisor with respect to the potential sale process.
On May 26, 2022, by unanimous written consent, the Board approved the May Projections for use in the potential sale process. Thereafter, the May
Projections were provided to the parties participating in the potential sale process as part of their due diligence and to Goldman Sachs for use in their
financial analyses.
On May 29, 2022, representatives of Party G, a private equity firm and the majority owner of Company B, contacted a member of Avalara’s senior
management to express their interest in a potential transaction, including a potential acquisition of Avalara or a potential merger with Company B.
Following discussions between Avalara senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Avalara’s senior management determined it was in the
best interests of Avalara, and consistent with the directions of the Board, to engage in further discussions with Party G to explore their interest in a
potential transaction and potentially permit Party G to participate in the potential sale process.
Over the course of the end of May and the first week of June, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party E, Vista and Party G entered into confidentiality
agreements with Avalara. The confidentiality agreements included a prohibition on the counterparty contacting debt or equity financing sources without
Avalara’s prior approval, as well as a standstill provision, which did not prohibit the counterparty from making private acquisition proposals to Avalara.
As Party B had already engaged in discussions with an institutional co-investor regarding a potential acquisition of Avalara prior to being contacted by
Goldman Sachs, Party B requested consent from Avalara to contact such institutional co-investor as a potential financing source in connection with the
potential sale process. Following discussions between Avalara senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Avalara’s senior management
determined it was in the best interests of Avalara, and consistent with the directions of the Board, to permit Party B to contact such institutional co-
investor as a potential financing source. Party F informed Goldman Sachs that it did not wish to participate in the potential sale process and did not
execute a confidentiality agreement.
Beginning in the end of May, members of Avalara’s senior management held management presentations with the parties that had executed a
confidentiality agreement. From the end of May until the execution of the merger agreement on August 8, 2022 (or, if earlier, the date on which a party
engaged in the potential sale process ceased to pursue a potential transaction), each of the parties conducted due diligence that variously included
access to a virtual data room (except in the case of Party G, which was still separately considering
36
Table of Contents
whether to explore a potential transaction), review of additional documentary materials, virtual and in-person diligence sessions and other customary due
diligence.
On May 30, 2022, members of Avalara’s senior management met representatives of Party B for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things,
Avalara’s performance and strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.
On May 31, 2022, members of Avalara’s senior management met representatives of Vista for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things,
Avalara’s performance and strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.
On June 1, 2022, members of Avalara’s senior management met representatives of Party A for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things,
Avalara’s performance and strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.
On June 2, 2022, Vista contacted Goldman Sachs to request Avalara’s consent to contact six institutional co-investors to serve as potential equity
financing sources in addition to several potential debt financing sources. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Vista that it would discuss the
request with Avalara.
On June 6, 2022, a representative of a private equity firm who had not been contacted in the potential sale process contacted members of Avalara’s senior
management to express interest in participating as an investor in a strategic combination involving Avalara and Company C. During the course of this
discussion, the representative of the private equity firm did not state that it had any knowledge of whether Company C would be interested in engaging
in a transaction with Avalara and did not express an interest in leading an acquisition of Avalara.
On June 7, 2022, Party C contacted Goldman Sachs to express its interest in partnering with additional private equity firms in connection with leading an
acquisition of Avalara, as well as to seek Avalara’s consent to contact certain institutional co-investors as equity financing sources. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs informed Party C that it would discuss the request with Avalara.
On June 8, 2022, Party E contacted Goldman Sachs to express its interest in partnering with another private equity firm involved in the potential sale
process in connection with leading an acquisition of Avalara. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party E that it would discuss the request with
Avalara.
On June 8, 2022, members of Avalara’s senior management met representatives of Vista for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things,
Avalara’s performance and strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.
On June 9, 2022, Party E contacted Goldman Sachs to request Avalara’s consent to contact six institutional co-investors to serve as potential equity
financing sources. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party E that it would discuss the request with Avalara.
On June 10, 2022, Party A contacted Goldman Sachs to request Avalara’s consent to contact one institutional co-investor to serve as a potential equity
financing source and six financial institutions to serve as potential debt financing sources. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party A that it
would discuss the request with Avalara.
Later on June 10, 2022, members of Avalara’s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs updated members of the Board on the potential
sale process by videoconference. Following this update and subsequent discussions between members of Avalara’s senior management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs, members of Avalara’s senior management determined it was in the best interests of Avalara, and consistent with the
directions of the Board, to permit Vista to contact three institutional co-investors who had not also been requested by any other party to serve as
potential equity financing sources. Members of Avalara’s senior management determined it was in the best interests of Avalara, and consistent with the
directions of the
37

Board, to not permit Vista and other parties to contact institutional co-investors that had also been requested by at least one other party so that, in the
event the potential sale process were to proceed, those other institutional co-investors could be assigned among the parties that remained in the process
in order for all parties to have sufficient access to financing sources. Members of Avalara’s senior management also determined it was in the best
interests of Avalara, and consistent with the directions of the Board, not to permit any party to partner with any other party or to contact potential debt
financing sources at the current time.
On June 13, 2022, Party C contacted Goldman Sachs to request Avalara’s consent to contact three institutional co-investors to serve as potential equity
financing sources and four financial institutions to serve as potential debt financing sources. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party C that it
would discuss the request with Avalara.
Also on June 13, 2022, Party D informed Goldman Sachs that they were no longer interested in a potential acquisition of Avalara and would cease to
participate in the potential sale process because of the potential size of the transaction, the timing of the sale process and their assessment of the
valuation that a transaction would likely require.
Also on June 13, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs sent a letter to each of Party A, Party B, Party C, Party E and Vista setting
forth in greater detail the procedures for the potential sale process and asking for initial indications of interest to be submitted by June 22, 2022.
On June 17, 2022, Party B contacted Goldman Sachs to express its interest in partnering with one or more private equity firms in connection with leading
an acquisition of Avalara. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party B that it would discuss the request with Avalara.
Also on June 17, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management and representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (“Simpson Thacher”), Avalara’s outside counsel, in attendance. Before the representatives of
Goldman Sachs joined the meeting, members of Avalara’s senior management reviewed with the Board an extrapolation of the May Projections for fiscal
years 2026 through 2042 that had been prepared by Avalara’s senior management for use by Goldman Sachs in their financial analyses. Following
discussion, the Board approved the extrapolation of the May Projections for use by Goldman Sachs in their financial analyses. A member of Avalara’s
senior management also reviewed with the Board the engagement letter with Goldman Sachs that had been previously reviewed by a majority of the
directors and entered into by Avalara, which the Board ratified at this meeting. Following such discussion, representatives of Goldman Sachs joined the
meeting. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed and discussed with the Board its fiduciary duties, including those in connection with a potential
sale of Avalara. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an update on the potential sale process, including an inquiry from a representative of a
private equity firm regarding a rumor of a potential transaction process involving Avalara, in respect of which the representatives of Goldman Sachs
expressed their views that the private equity firm did not have a serious interest in Avalara given the nature of the outreach and that they had not made
any further inquiries, and a request by Vista to potentially review the proposed form of merger agreement for any transaction in advance of submitting
initial indications of interest. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the Board a draft merger agreement that contemplated, among other
things, a “hell or high water” regulatory efforts standard requiring an acquiror to take all actions to obtain all necessary regulatory approval, a “go-shop”
provision permitting Avalara to solicit alternative proposals following the execution of the merger agreement, the ability of Avalara to terminate the merger
agreement to accept a superior proposal, a company termination fee equal to 2.0% of transaction equity value (or, with respect to a proposal received from
a party that made an alternative proposal during the “go-shop” period, 1.0% of transaction equity value) and a reverse termination fee equal to 8.0% of
transaction equity value. Following discussion, the Board directed members of Avalara’s senior management and Goldman Sachs to provide the draft
merger agreement to the parties participating in the potential sale process. Thereafter, the draft merger agreement was made available in the virtual data
room to Party A, Party B, Party C, Party E and Vista. The draft merger agreement was not made available to Party G as they were still separately
considering whether to explore a potential transaction.

On June 20, 2022, Scott McFarlane, Avalara’s chief executive officer and a director of Avalara, spoke with the chairman of the board of directors of
Company A who informed Mr. McFarlane that Company A was unlikely to proceed with a transaction at the price proposed by Avalara in its April 18,
2022 indication of interest and that Company A’s management team sought to continue as an independent company. In light of this feedback, members of
Avalara’s senior management ceased to actively pursue a potential transaction with Company A and informed the Board of this development in
connection with its June 24, 2022 meeting.
On June 21, 2022, Party G informed Goldman Sachs that they had determined not to explore a potential transaction involving Avalara because of
challenging market conditions and the difficulty of achieving significant synergies in a potential combination with Company B.
Later on June 21, 2022, Mr. McFarlane met representatives of Vista for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things, Avalara’s performance
and strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.
On June 22, 2022, Party C informed members of Avalara’s senior management that they would not submit an indication of interest because of market
conditions as well as concerns around Avalara’s operating plan. Separately, Party E informed Goldman Sachs that they would not submit an indication of
interest because they did not believe that their valuation would be attractive to the Board. Separately, Party B informed Goldman Sachs that they would
need more time to determine whether to submit an indication of interest. Party B ultimately did not submit an indication of interest at any point during the
potential sale process.
On June 23, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs received indications of interest from Party A and Vista to acquire Avalara in an
all-cash transaction. The indications of interest, each of which was preliminary in nature and made subject to further due diligence, were as follows: Party
A valued Avalara between $90.00 and $95.00 per share of Avalara common stock, and Vista valued Avalara between $97.00 and $101.00 per share of
Avalara common stock. In connection with their indications of interest, both Party A and Vista requested to contact additional debt financing sources and
institutional co-investors.
On June 24, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. In connection with the meeting, a representative of Avalara’s senior management furnished to the Board a
disclosure statement provided by Goldman Sachs that identified prior or current engagements or relationships between Goldman Sachs and each of Party
A and Vista and certain of their respective affiliates and portfolio companies. At the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed the disclosure
statement with the Board. The relationships with Vista and its affiliates and portfolio companies are discussed in greater detail in the section entitled
“Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed with the Board
its participation in Avalara’s capped call transaction that had been entered into in connection with its issuance of convertible notes and the potential
effects of a sale of Avalara on such transaction as further described in the section entitled “Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” beginning on page 53
of this proxy statement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board the indications of interest received from Party A and Vista and its
preliminary financial analyses based on the May Projections (including the extrapolations through 2042) and discussed relevant considerations for the
Board in determining whether to continue with the potential sale process and whether to contact additional potential financial or strategic parties to
participate in the potential sale process. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and members of Avalara’s senior management expressed their views that,
because Avalara’s strategy is centered around being platform-agnostic and involves integrating Avalara’s products and services into the platforms of
many different partners who compete with others, such that a potential acquisition of Avalara by a strategic buyer could potentially result in a significant
loss of customers because partners could cease to integrate Avalara’s products and services into their respective platforms, they did not expect that
contacting additional potential strategic or financial parties would result in additional proposals with a value in excess of the price that could be achieved
from Party A or Vista. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also highlighted certain transaction risks associated with contacting additional
39
Table of Contents
parties and discussed other potential strategic alternatives available to Avalara. Following discussion, including of Avalara’s prospects as a standalone
company, the challenges that could prevent Avalara from achieving its strategic plan and the need to engage in a strategic acquisition that could
negatively impact Avalara’s market value, the Board supported continuing the potential sale process without contacting additional parties, including
permitting the parties to contact additional debt financing sources and institutional co-investors, and directed Goldman Sachs to solicit revised proposals
from the current bidders.
Following the meeting, at various points during the potential sale process in response to additional requests from Party A and Vista to contact additional
debt financing sources and institutional co-investors, Avalara’s senior management determined it was in the best interests of Avalara, and consistent
with the directions of the Board, to permit Party A and Vista to contact certain debt financing sources and institutional co-investors.
On July 5, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs sent a letter to each of Party A and Vista setting forth in greater detail the
procedures for the next round of the potential sale process and asking for definitive proposals, together with markups of the draft merger agreement, to be
submitted by July 14, 2022.
On July 6 and 7, 2022, representatives of Vista met with members of Avalara’s senior management to conduct due diligence, which included dinner on the
evening of July 6, 2022. Among other topics, members of Avalara’s senior management discussed a summary of Avalara’s performance in the second
quarter of 2022, which was below management’s expectations for revenue, representing the first quarter since Avalara’s initial public offering where
Avalara would not beat public market analysts’ expectations on revenue, except for its earnings guidance released in May 2020 as a result of uncertainty
around the COVID-19 pandemic, and increase its revenue guidance for the year, and the effect of such performance on Avalara’s expected performance
for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year.
On July 7, 2022, various media reports speculated that Avalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential acquisition. The price per share of
Avalara common stock as of the close of trading on July 6, 2022, the last trading day prior to such speculation, was $73.54, and the price per share of
Avalara common stock as of the close of trading on July 7, 2022, the day such speculation began, was $85.63. Following the release of these reports,
representatives of Goldman Sachs received inquiries of varying degrees of seriousness from a variety of parties that were reviewed with members of
Avalara’s senior management and with the Board at the applicable meeting following receipt of each such inquiry.
Later on July 7, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management in attendance. Members of
Avalara’s senior management reviewed with the Board the media reports speculating that Avalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential
transaction. Members of Avalara’s senior management then discussed with the Board Avalara’s second quarter performance and a preliminary update to
the forecast for the 2022 fiscal year included in the May Projections to take into account Avalara’s performance in the second quarter of 2022 and the
effect of such performance on Avalara’s expected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year, including a reduction in the growth of new and
upsell bookings as a result of execution challenges and sales capacity issues, which reduction was expected to increase in the remainder of fiscal year
2022, high attrition in Avalara’s sales and marketing departments, anticipated diminishing revenue from its relationship with Partner A and additional
challenges in Avalara’s business. Members of Avalara’s senior management also reviewed with the Board recent challenges and opportunities in
Avalara’s strategic plan, the potential effects on the Company’s market value as a result of continuing to execute on the Company’s strategic plan,
potential strategic acquisitions and the status of the potential sale process.
On July 8, 2022, representatives of Party A met with Avalara to conduct due diligence. Among other topics, members of Avalara’s senior management
discussed a summary of Avalara’s performance in the second quarter of 2022, which was below management’s expectations for revenue, representing the
first quarter since Avalara’s initial public offering where Avalara would not beat public market analysts’ expectations on revenue and, except for its
earnings guidance released in May 2020 as a result of uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic,
40
Table of Contents
increase its revenue guidance for the year, and the effect of such performance on Avalara’s expected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year.
On July 10, 2022, Avalara made additional details of Avalara’s performance in the second quarter of 2022 and the effect of such performance on Avalara’s
expected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year available to both Vista and Party A in the virtual dataroom.
On July 12, 2022, Party A informed Goldman Sachs that they would not submit a definitive proposal because Avalara’s second quarter results were below
management’s expectations for revenue, their belief that Avalara’s results for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year would also be below expectations,
general macroeconomic conditions were uncertain and unfavorable, and a definitive proposal would likely include a price that would be substantially
below their previous indication of interest, which Party A did not expect to be of interest to the Board.
On July 15, 2022, having not received a definitive proposal from Vista by the requested deadline of July 14, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs
contacted Vista to confirm whether Vista was still interested in participating in the potential sale process. In discussions with Goldman Sachs, Vista
informed Goldman Sachs that, while they were still interested in participating in the potential sale process, they required more time before being able to
submit a definitive proposal in light of Avalara’s second quarter results being below management’s expectations for revenue, their belief that Avalara’s
results for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year would also be below expectations, the deterioration in the financial markets and their need to contact
additional financing sources and continue discussions with existing financing sources to obtain the financing that would be necessary to acquire
Avalara. Vista also indicated that any definitive proposal would likely include a price that would be below their previous indication of interest.
On July 16, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs noted that, since the media reports on July 7, 2022 speculating that
Avalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential acquisition, several additional private equity firms had contacted them to express interest in
potentially participating in a transaction involving Avalara, including as a potential source of financing, but not necessarily in leading an independent
acquisition of Avalara, and none of these private equity firms submitted any oral or written indication of interest following such contacts.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Board the feedback received from Party A as to why it did not make a definitive proposal and
their discussions with Vista as to why it had not submitted a definitive proposal by the requested deadline of July 14, 2022. Following discussion among
the Board, including Avalara’s prospects as a standalone company and Avalara’s options to continue the potential sale process, the Board decided to
terminate the potential sale process.
On July 17, 2022, consistent with the Board’s determination to terminate the potential sale process, Vista’s access to the virtual data room was withdrawn.
On July 18, 2022, representatives of Vista spoke with representatives of Goldman Sachs about their access to the virtual data room being withdrawn.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed the representatives of Vista that, since Vista had not submitted a definitive proposal by the requested
deadline of July 14, 2022, the Board had decided not to continue the potential sale process with Vista, and Vista’s access to the virtual data room had been
withdrawn.
On July 18, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management to address ordinary
course matters that included the review of an updated version of the May Projections, which we refer to as the “July Projections” (discussed further in
the section entitled “Financial Projections” beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement). The July Projections updated the May Projections to take into
account Avalara’s performance in the second quarter of 2022 and the effect of such
41
Table of Contents
performance on Avalara’s expected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year and the remainder of the forecast period, including a reduction in
the growth of new and upsell bookings as a result of execution challenges and sales capacity issues, which reduction was expected to increase in the
remainder of fiscal year 2022, high attrition in Avalara’s sales and marketing departments, the expected further reduction, and likely eventual elimination,
in revenue from its relationship with Partner A and additional challenges in Avalara’s business. Members of Avalara’s senior management also discussed
with the Board the likely need to revise Avalara’s public guidance, including a reduction in expected revenue and, by a smaller amount, an increase in
non-GAAP operating income, as a result of Avalara’s performance in the second quarter of 2022 and the effect of such performance on Avalara’s expected
performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year.
On July 19, 2022, Vista submitted to Goldman Sachs an unsolicited revised indication of interest to acquire Avalara in an all-cash transaction that valued
Avalara at $91.00 per share and requested additional diligence information and the ability to contact certain additional debt financing sources and
institutional co-investors.
Later on July 19, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke with representatives of Vista and reiterated that the Board had decided not to continue
the potential sale process with Vista and noted that Vista’s revised indication of interest was significantly lower than its initial indication of interest and
that it was unlikely to be of interest to the Board. The representatives of Goldman Sachs asked the representatives of Vista about aspects of their revised
indication of interest, including Vista’s ability to propose a higher valuation. The representatives of Vista stated that their ability to obtain financing
would affect their valuation.
On July 20, 2022, following discussion with representatives of Goldman Sachs, Mr. McFarlane spoke with a representative of Vista and reiterated that the
Board had decided not to continue the potential sale process with Vista and noted that Vista’s revised indication of interest was significantly lower than
its initial indication of interest and that he believed it was unlikely to be of interest to the Board. Mr. McFarlane suggested that a valuation greater than or
equal to the range originally proposed by Vista in its June 23, 2022 indication of interest would be more likely to be of interest to the Board. The
representative of Vista did not state whether Vista would be able to propose a greater valuation.
Later on July 20, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke with representatives of Vista. The representatives of Vista noted that, while Avalara’s
second quarter results were below management’s expectations for revenue and Vista believed that Avalara’s results for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal
year would also be below expectations, Vista could potentially offer an increased price but that it would need to complete its diligence and to contact
additional financing sources to obtain the financing that would be necessary to acquire Avalara, particularly given that the financial markets had
continued to deteriorate.
On July 21, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed the revised indication of interest received from Vista. Following
discussion of whether to respond to Vista and potential responses, the Board agreed to permit Vista to contact additional debt financing sources and
institutional co-investors and directed Goldman Sachs to inform Vista that, while the Board would have been willing to consider a transaction based on
the valuation proposed in Vista’s original indication of interest, the Board was unlikely to consider a transaction at the valuation proposed in Vista’s
revised indication of interest and that Vista would need to meaningfully increase its proposed valuation in order for the Board to consider a transaction.
The Board also directed management and Simpson Thacher to advance the merger agreement with Vista and its counsel to determine the existence of any
other potential material issues.
On July 21, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Vista to ask that a revised indication of interest be
submitted by August 1, 2022. The representatives of Vista responded that they would seek to submit a revised indication of interest but did not commit to
submitting such indication by August 1, 2022.

Table of Contents
On July 22, 2022, Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland & Ellis”), outside counsel to Vista, sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Simpson Thacher that
contemplated, among other things, that Avalara would be subject to a “no-shop” provision where it would not be able to solicit alternative proposals
following the execution of the merger agreement, a company termination fee equal to 3.75% of transaction equity value and a reverse termination fee equal
to 4.25% of transaction equity value.
On July 27, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Vista to ask when Vista expected to submit a
revised indication of interest. The representatives of Vista responded that they would seek to submit a revised indication of interest by August 4, 2022 or
earlier.
On July 28, 2022, by unanimous written consent, the Board approved the July Projections that had been reviewed with the Board at its regularly
scheduled meeting on July 18, 2022, together with an extrapolation of the July Projections for fiscal years 2026 through 2042 that had been prepared by
Avalara’s senior management for use by Goldman Sachs in their financial analyses, for use in the potential sale process.
Also on July 28, 2022, Simpson Thacher sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Kirkland & Ellis that contemplated, among other things, that
Avalara would be permitted a “go-shop” provision permitting Avalara to solicit alternative proposals following the execution of the merger agreement, a
company termination fee equal to 2.5% of transaction equity value (or, with respect to a proposal received from a party that made an alternative proposal
during the “go-shop” period, 1.25% of transaction equity value) and a reverse termination fee equal to 7.0% of transaction equity value.
On August 1, 2022, Kirkland & Ellis sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Simpson Thacher that contemplated, among other things, that Avalara
would be subject to a “no-shop” provision where it would not be able to solicit alternative proposals following the execution of the merger agreement, a
company termination fee equal to 3.5% of transaction equity value and a reverse termination fee equal to 4.5% of transaction equity value.
On August 2, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Vista to ask whether Vista still expected to
submit a revised indication of interest by August 4, 2022. The representatives of Vista responded that they would seek to submit a revised indication of
interest by August 4, 2022.
On August 3, 2022, Mr. McFarlane spoke with representatives of Vista and noted that, if Vista were still interested in a potential transaction with Avalara,
Vista would need to submit a revised indication of interest promptly for the Board’s consideration. Mr. McFarlane also emphasized that, while the Board
would have been willing to consider a transaction based on the valuation proposed in Vista’s original indication of interest, the Board was unwilling to
consider a transaction at the valuation proposed in Vista’s revised indication of interest and that Vista would need to meaningfully increase its proposed
valuation in order for the Board to consider a transaction.
On August 4, 2022, Simpson Thacher sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Kirkland & Ellis that contemplated, among other things, that Avalara
would be permitted a “go-shop” provision permitting Avalara to solicit alternative proposals following the execution of the merger agreement, a company
termination fee equal to 2.75% of transaction equity value (or, with respect to a proposal received from a party that made an alternative proposal during
the “go-shop” period, 1.375% of transaction equity value) and a reverse termination fee equal to 6.5% of transaction equity value.
Later on August 4, 2022, Vista verbally communicated to Goldman Sachs that they planned to submit a revised indication of interest at a price of $91.00
per share, given their additional due diligence of the deterioration of Avalara’s business following the submission of their previous indication. Following
discussion with members of Avalara’s senior management, representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with Vista their perspective that $91.00 per share
would likely not be attractive to the Board, and a higher price in the range of their initial indication of interest of $97.00-101.00 per share would be more
likely to be attractive to the Board.
43
Table of Contents
Thereafter, on August 4, 2022, Vista submitted to Goldman Sachs a revised indication of interest to acquire Avalara in an all-cash transaction that valued
Avalara at $92.25 per share.
In the morning of August 5, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the directors their fiduciary
duties. Members of Avalara’s senior management reviewed with the Board the July Projections, Avalara’s strategic plan, the challenges that could
prevent Avalara from achieving its strategic plan, including a reduction in the growth of new and upsell bookings as a result of execution challenges and
sales capacity issues, high attrition in Avalara’s sales and marketing departments, the expected further reduction, and likely eventual elimination, of
revenue from its relationship with Partner A and additional challenges in Avalara’s business, including the likely need for organizational changes to
optimize Avalara’s business, and the standalone prospects of Avalara in the near to medium term, including that Avalara was unlikely to be able to
acquire Company A or other companies or businesses in the industries in, or adjacent to, which Avalara operates that members of Avalara’s senior
management believed would be necessary to advance Avalara’s strategic plan. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board the market
price of Avalara’s common stock compared to the market prices of other companies in the industries in which Avalara operates, including the fact that the
market price of Avalara’s common stock had increased by 28% since the media reports on July 7, 2022 speculating that Avalara had been contacted by
Vista regarding a potential acquisition compared to an average increase of 8-10% in the market prices of other companies in the industries in which
Avalara operates. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed with the Board the terms of Vista’s revised indication of interest and its preliminary
financial analyses based on the July Projections, and representatives of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the Board material issues in the most recent draft
of the merger agreement, including whether a “go-shop” or “no-shop” provision would be included. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reminded the
Board that, since the media reports on July 7, 2022 speculating that Avalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential acquisition, several
additional private equity firms had contacted them to express interest in potentially participating in a transaction involving Avalara, but none had
proposed an independent acquisition of Avalara, none of the private equity firms had submitted any oral or written indication of interest following such
contacts, and no strategic party had contacted Goldman Sachs or Avalara to express interest, so the representatives of Goldman Sachs did not believe
that there were additional parties that would be likely to make a proposal to acquire Avalara. Following discussion, including of whether Vista’s revised
indication of interest resulted in greater value to Avalara shareholders compared to remaining a standalone company and continuing to execute on
Avalara’s strategic plan, the Board met first in executive session without members of management present, other than Mr. McFarlane, and then met in an
independent session, without Mr. McFarlane present. Following the conclusion of the executive session, the Board instructed Goldman Sachs and
Avalara’s senior management to seek a further improved proposal from Vista of $95.00 per share or greater that could include a “no-shop” provision if
such a higher valuation were proposed by Vista in light of the Board’s conclusion that no additional parties would be likely to make a proposal to acquire
Avalara regardless of whether a “go-shop” provision were included in the merger agreement.
Later on August 5, 2022, following discussion with Avalara’s senior management and consistent with the Board’s directives, at the direction of Avalara,
representatives of Goldman Sachs proposed to Vista that it increase its proposed valuation to $95.75 per share, at which valuation the merger agreement
could include a “no-shop” provision, but the merger agreement would also need to include a company termination fee equal to less than 3.0% of
transaction equity value and a reverse termination fee equal to 6.5% of transaction equity value. In response, representatives of Vista informed Goldman
Sachs that Vista would not be able to proceed at such proposed valuation and that it would cease any further work on a potential transaction. Following
additional discussion with Avalara’s senior management and consistent with the Board’s directives, at the direction of Avalara, representatives of
Goldman Sachs proposed to Vista that it submit a “best and final” offer.
In the evening of August 5, 2022, Vista verbally communicated a further revised indication of interest to Goldman Sachs reflecting its “best and final”
offer, proposing a potential acquisition of Avalara by Vista for
44
Table of Contents
$93.50 per share in cash, conditioned on a “no-shop” provision, a company termination fee equal to 2.75% of transaction equity value and a reverse
termination fee equal to 5.50% of transaction equity value.
Later in the evening of August 5, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board their discussions
with Vista over the course of the day and Vista’s further revised “best and final” indication of interest. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed for
the Board the remaining material issues related to the merger agreement and the debt and equity financing commitments of Vista required for the proposed
transaction. Following discussion and the Board’s conclusion that no higher value could be obtained from Vista, the Board instructed Avalara’s senior
management, Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher to continue to explore the proposed transaction with Vista and finalize negotiation of the terms of the
merger agreement and related documentation by August 7, at which time the Board would formally review the proposed transaction and determine
whether to adopt the merger agreement. Later in the evening of August 5, 2022 following the Board meeting, Vista confirmed its earlier verbal indication of
interest in writing.
On August 6, 2022 and August 7, 2022, Simpson Thacher and Kirkland & Ellis exchanged several drafts of, and held discussions, some of which included
members of Avalara’s senior management and representatives of Vista, regarding, the merger agreement and related documents.
On August 7, 2022, Goldman Sachs provided the July Projections and the extrapolation of the July Projections for fiscal years 2026 through 2042 to Vista.
In the evening of August 7, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara’s senior management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Avalara’s senior management reviewed with the Board the
negotiations with Vista regarding the merger agreement. At the request of the Board, Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board its financial analysis of the
merger consideration and delivered to the Board an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August 8,
2022, to the effect that, as of the date of its written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $93.50 in
cash per share of Avalara’s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly
owned subsidiary of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of Goldman
Sachs is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. See also the section of this
proxy statement entitled “Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” beginning on page 53. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the Board
their fiduciary duties in connection with the consideration of the merger agreement and proposed transaction, the terms of the negotiated merger
agreement, the debt and equity financing commitments required for the proposed transaction and the other documentation related to the merger. A
representative of Simpson Thacher then described the resolutions before the Board. After discussion, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Avalara and its
shareholders, (ii) adopted the merger agreement and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, (iii) subject to the terms of the merger agreement, resolved to recommend that the
shareholders of Avalara vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and (iv) directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the
shareholders of Avalara at a special meeting of shareholders for their approval.
Following the adoption by the Board of the merger agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby, early in the morning on August 8, 2022, the
parties executed the merger agreement and the other documentation related to the proposed transaction. Concurrently with the execution of the merger
agreement, Vista delivered executed debt and equity financing commitment letters providing for the committed debt and equity financing required for the
proposed transaction.

The Board unanimously recommends that Avalara shareholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.
At a meeting of the Board held on August 7, 2022, after an extensive review process, the Board unanimously (i) determined that it was advisable and in
the best interest of Avalara and Avalara shareholders that Avalara enter into the merger agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger and
the merger agreement, (iii) resolved that the approval of the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by Avalara shareholders at a special
meeting of Avalara shareholders and (iv) recommended that Avalara shareholders approve the merger agreement.
When you consider the Board’s recommendation, you should be aware that Avalara’s executive officers and directors may have interests in the merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Avalara shareholders generally. These interests are described in “The Merger—Interests of
Avalara Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
Factors Considered Supporting Approval of the Merger.
In the course of reaching its decision, the Board consulted with members of Avalara senior management and our financial and legal advisors and
considered a significant amount of information and a number of factors that it believed supported its decision, including the following (not necessarily in
order of relative importance):
The merger consideration represents a significant premium across a number of measuring periods. The Board considered that the merger consideration
of $93.50 per share in cash was an attractive value for the shares of Avalara common stock and represented:
•
a 27.1% premium over the $73.54 closing price of Avalara common stock on July 6, 2022 (the last trading day prior to media reports
speculating that Avalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential acquisition);
•
a 28.9% premium over the volume weighted average price of Avalara common stock of $72.55 reported for the 5-trading day period ended
July 6, 2022;
•
a 21.5% premium over the volume weighted average price of Avalara common stock of $76.93 reported for the 30-trading day period ended
July 6, 2022; and
•
a 18.2% premium over the volume weighted average price of Avalara common stock of $79.11 reported for the 90-trading day period ended
July 6, 2022.
Strategic alternatives to a sale of the Company. The Board considered the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing Avalara shareholders
associated with possible strategic alternatives to the merger (including the potential shareholder value based on our strategic plan that could be expected
to be generated from remaining an independent public company and the possibility of acquisitions of other companies, as well as the potential benefits,
risks and uncertainties associated with such alternatives), and the timing and difficulty of accomplishing such alternatives, including the unsuccessful
discussions that Avalara had engaged in with Company A. Based on the foregoing, the Board considered that none of these options, on a risk-adjusted
basis, was reasonably likely to create value for Avalara shareholders greater than the merger consideration in the foreseeable future.
Risks relating to remaining a stand-alone company. The Board evaluated Avalara’s long-term strategic plan were it to remain an independent public
company, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such
46Table of Contents
plan. This evaluation included the Board’s review of our business, operations, assets, operating results, financial condition, prospects, business strategy,
competitive position, and industry, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of those factors on the trading price of our
common stock, to assess the prospects and risks associated with remaining an independent public company. The Board believed that the certainty
provided by the acquisition of Avalara by Parent for $93.50 per share in cash was more favorable to Avalara shareholders than the potential risk-adjusted
value of remaining an independent public company, after accounting for the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving and executing upon our
business and financial plans in the short- and long-term. Such risks include:
•
our competitive positioning and prospects as an independent publicly traded company, which included consideration of our financial
resources and ability to respond to new and evolving threats and challenges, including the difficulty of being able to acquire Company A or
other companies or businesses in the industries in which Avalara operates that members of Avalara’s senior management believed would be
necessary to achieve Avalara’s strategic plan;
•
the current and prospective business environment in which Avalara operates, including international, national and local economic
conditions, the competitive environment (including increased competition in the United States and internationally), and the likely effect of
these factors on Avalara and the execution of Avalara’s plans as a standalone company;
•
our ability to sustain our historical revenue growth and achieve profitability and expand our international operations, including a reduction
in the growth of new and upsell bookings as a result of execution challenges and sales capacity issues in the second quarter of 2022, which
reduction was expected to increase in the remainder of fiscal year 2022, and the expected further reduction, and the possible elimination, of
revenue from its relationship with Partner A;
•
reductions in regulatory and compliance requirements for certain customers in non-U.S. jurisdictions that have reduced the growth rate for,
and profitability of, Avalara’s products and services;
•
challenges of making potential investments and decisions around human resources to achieve long-term growth prospects while a publicly
traded company that is subject to scrutiny based on its quarter-over-quarter performance, including high attrition in Avalara’s sales and
marketing departments and the likely need for organizational changes to optimize Avalara’s business if Avalara were to remain a standalone
company;
•
our recent second quarter financial results, which were below management’s expectations of our financial performance on revenue and the
first quarter since Avalara’s initial public offering where Avalara would not beat public market analysts’ expectations of revenue and
increase its revenue guidance for the year, and the effect of such performance on Avalara’s expected performance for the remainder of the
2022 fiscal year, which would likely have required Avalara to modify its public guidance that had been previously disclosed by Avalara’s
senior management in its first quarter earnings release, including to reduce expected revenue and, by a smaller amount, increase non-GAAP
operating income, had the merger agreement not been executed; and
•
other risks and uncertainties discussed in Avalara’s public filings with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on
page 113 of this proxy statement.
Process to explore a sale of the Company. The Board considered the strategic process that Avalara undertook, with the assistance of its financial advisor,
to evaluate its strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of Avalara, which included the outreach conducted during the potential sale process by
our financial advisor during which it engaged with various other parties and the fact that none of those other parties demonstrated a substantial interest
in acquiring Avalara or presented a proposal as compelling as the one presented by Parent and that there was limited outreach from other third parties
following the multiple media reports and market speculation regarding a potential acquisition of Avalara.
47
Table of Contents
As a result of factors such as the processes conducted by Avalara with the assistance of its financial advisor at the Board’s direction and the periodic
conversations Avalara has had with other parties over the few months, the Board believed that it had an informed understanding of the parties most likely
to be willing and able to acquire or engage in other strategic transactions with Avalara. Specifically, Goldman Sachs conducted direct outreach to eight
financial sponsors that Avalara and its financial advisor believed were likely to be most interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of Avalara. The
Board noted that these parties had been afforded the opportunity to participate in discussions with Avalara with respect to a potential transaction, but
that such discussions did not progress beyond a preliminary stage, as more fully described above under “The Merger—Background of the Merger”
beginning on page 33. Goldman Sachs had also had discussions with other parties that had contacted them following media reports speculating on a
potential acquisition of Avalara to express interest in potentially participating in a transaction involving Avalara, including as a potential source of
financing, but none of which had expressed interest in an independent acquisition of Avalara.
The Board also considered that (a) only Parent and Party A had submitted formal, written indications of interest to acquire Avalara, (b) Party A did not
submit a definitive proposal and ceased to participate in the potential sale process and (c) only Parent had submitted a definitive proposal to acquire
Avalara at the time the Board approved the merger agreement. The Board also took note of the terms of the merger agreement, including that if an
interested party were to submit a proposal that the Board determined was a superior proposal (as described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—Acquisition Proposals,” beginning on page 88) the Board could, prior to Avalara shareholders
approving the merger agreement and subject to complying with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including paying the termination fee of
$242.329 million, terminate the merger agreement and cause Avalara to enter into a definitive agreement for such superior proposal if the Board determined
in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Board considered in its view that the terms of the merger agreement were unlikely to
deter any interested parties from making a proposal to Avalara.
Cash consideration. The Board considered the fact that the merger consideration would be paid solely in cash, which provides certainty of value and
immediate liquidity to Avalara shareholders upon the consummation of the merger, in comparison to the risks and uncertainty that would be inherent in
remaining an independent public company. The Board weighed the certainty of realizing a compelling value for shares of Avalara common stock by virtue
of the merger against the uncertain prospect that the trading value for the Avalara common stock would approach the merger consideration in the
foreseeable future, which the Board concluded was unlikely. In reaching such conclusion, the Board considered a number of factors, including that
Avalara’s market value immediately prior to the execution of the merger agreement reflected the increase in market value as a result of the media reports
speculating on a potential acquisition of Avalara, that, if the Board were to not engage in a transaction, Avalara’s market value would likely decline,
potentially significantly, as a result of Avalara’s second quarter results being below management’s expectations and the first quarter since Avalara’s initial
public offering where Avalara would not beat public market analysts’ expectations and increase its revenue guidance for the year, and the effect of such
performance on Avalara’s expected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year, which would likely have required Avalara to modify its public
guidance that had been previously disclosed by Avalara’s senior management in its first quarter earnings release, including to reduce expected revenue
and, by a smaller amount, increase non-GAAP operating income, and the deterioration in the financial markets, and the risks and uncertainties associated
with our business.
Negotiations with Parent. The Board considered the extensive negotiations Avalara and its legal counsel had with Parent, including throughout the
period of time from June 23, 2022, which was the day Parent first submitted a written indication of interest, to the date on which the merger agreement was
executed on August 8, 2022, and that the negotiations were conducted on arms’ length and that the members of Avalara’s senior management and the
representatives of Vista did not have any substantive discussions on the role, responsibilities or compensation of Avalara’s management team following
the closing. The Board also considered and discussed at length with its financial and legal advisors the revised indication of interest submitted by Vista
on July 19,
48
Table of Contents
2022, which was at a lower proposed price than the what was proposed in Vista’s original indication of interest submitted on June 23, 2022 in light of
Avalara’s second quarter results being below management’s and public market analysts’ expectations and the deterioration in the financial markets. The
Board also considered that Parent increased its proposed price per share from $91.00 per share in its July 19, 2022 revised indication of interest to $92.25
per share in its revised indication of interest submitted on August 4, 2022, and that Parent further increased its proposed price per share to $93.50 per
share in its final indication of interest submitted on August 5, 2022, and its belief that the $93.50 per share price represented the highest price per share
that Parent was willing to pay for the Avalara common stock, considering the extensive due diligence conducted by Parent, the financing proposed by
Parent and the negotiations between the parties, and that the negotiations with Parent had resulted in the highest price reasonably available to Avalara
under the circumstances and the merger agreement contained terms and conditions that were, in the Board’s view, advisable and favorable to Avalara and
its shareholders. The Board further considered that no other potential buyer submitted and maintained an offer to acquire Avalara at a purchase price per
share that was greater than the $93.50 per share price to be paid in the proposed merger.
Antitrust regulatory approvals. The Board considered that the merger agreement only contemplated the receipt of approval under the HSR Act as the
sole regulatory approval required for the consummation of the merger, and the Board considered Parent’s obligation under the merger agreement to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary and proper under applicable laws and regulations in a timely manner
as are necessary to eliminate each impediment to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and obtain all approvals
required under the HSR Act, subject to certain limitations specified in the merger agreement, including agreeing to accept certain specified divestitures or
restrictions to the extent necessary to obtain such approvals.
Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The Board considered the financial analyses presented by representatives of Goldman Sachs at the Board’s meeting on
August 7, 2022, as well as the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August 8, 2022,
to the effect that, as of the date of its written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $93.50 in cash per
share of Avalara’s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned
subsidiary of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara’s common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The Goldman Sachs opinion is more fully described in
“The Merger—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” and the full text of the Goldman Sachs opinion is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
Economic conditions. The Board considered the current state of the economy, debt financing markets and uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic
conditions both in the near term and the long term, which could negative affect our financial performance.
Merger agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the structure of the transaction, the all-cash form
of the merger consideration, the limited conditions to closing, the customary nature of the representations, warranties, and the covenants and agreements
of the parties. The Board further considered the course and nature of negotiations with Parent, which were conducted at arm’s length and during which
the Board was advised by independent legal and financial advisors on a regular basis. The Board took into account the terms of the merger agreement,
including:
•
Parent’s covenants in furtherance of obtaining required regulatory approvals, subject to certain limitations described in the merger
agreement;
•
Avalara’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with a third party, if the Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the third party has made a competing proposal
that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal;
49
Table of Contents
•
the right of the Board to change its recommendation that Avalara shareholders approve the merger agreement in connection with a superior
proposal, subject to certain restrictions and the requirement that we pay Parent the applicable termination fee if the Board makes a change in
recommendation and the merger agreement is terminated as a result;
•
the Board’s belief that our obligation to pay Parent a termination fee of $242.329 million, or approximately 2.75% of the aggregate equity
value of the transaction, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, as well as the right of Parent to match any
competing proposal that the Board in good faith determines constitutes a superior proposal in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement, are reasonable under the circumstances and would not preclude other potential acquirers from making an alternative proposal to
acquire Avalara if they were interested in making such a proposal;
•
the right of Avalara to terminate the merger agreement if Parent fails to consummate the merger in breach of the merger agreement, and the
obligation of Parent, under specified circumstances, to pay Avalara a reverse termination fee of $484.659 million upon such termination; and
•
the right of Avalara to seek an injunction, specific performance and other equitable remedies if needed in order to prevent breaches of the
merger agreement by Parent.
Vista’s capabilities. The Board considered Vista’s financial capacity to complete an acquisition of this size and its prior track record of completing
acquisitions, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction with Vista could be completed efficiently and in an orderly manner.
Financing. The Board considered the fact that Parent has obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from reputable institutions, and that
Parent has obtained committed equity financing from the Investors for the full amount of equity required in connection with such committed debt
financing, as well as the fact that Parent must use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the debt financing and the equity financing and that
such funding, together with the projected cash balances at Avalara, provides an amount sufficient to cover the aggregate merger consideration, all fees
and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the surviving corporation in connection with the merger and the financing, the repurchase of
Avalara’s outstanding convertible notes and all other payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the surviving corporation in connection therewith.
Board’s independence and comprehensive review process. The Board considered the fact that the Board consisted of a majority of independent directors
who unanimously approved the merger agreement following extensive discussions with Avalara’s management team, representatives of its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, and also took into consideration the financial expertise and prior industry experience held by a number of directors.
Shareholders’ ability to reject the merger. The Board considered the fact that the merger is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of Avalara
common stock, and that shareholders would be able to reject the merger.
Dissenters’ rights. The Board considered the fact that shareholders who do not vote for the approval of the merger agreement and who follow certain
prescribed procedures will have the right to dissent from the merger and demand appraisal of the fair value of their shares under the WBCA.
Other Factors Considered by the Board.
In the course of reaching its decision, the Board also considered and balanced against the potential benefits of the merger a number of potentially
adverse factors concerning the merger, including the following:
No further shareholder participation in future gains. The Board considered the fact that Avalara would no longer exist as an independent public
company following the merger and that Avalara shareholders would forgo
50
Table of Contents
any future increase in Avalara’s value following the merger that might result from our earnings or possible growth as an independent company. Although
the Board was optimistic about Avalara’s prospects on a stand-alone basis and our strategic plan, the Board concluded that there were a number of
significant risks associated with remaining an independent company (including as described in more detail above) that in many cases were difficult to
quantify and that the premium reflected in the merger consideration constituted fair compensation for the loss of the potential shareholder benefits that
could reasonably be expected to be realized by our strategic plan in the foreseeable future, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis.
Regulatory risk. The Board considered the risk that the approval under the HSR Act may be delayed, conditioned or denied, and the risk that the
applicable governmental agencies may seek to impose unfavorable terms or conditions, or otherwise fail to grant, such approvals.
Risks associated with announcement and pendency of the merger. The Board considered the risk that the announcement and pendency of the merger
may cause substantial harm to relationships with our employees, sales representatives, customers or strategic partners or may divert management and
employee attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business. The Board also considered our ability to attract and retain key personnel while
the proposed transaction is pending and the potential adverse effects on our financial results as a result of that disruption, as well as the possibility of
any suit, action or proceeding in respect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.
Risks associated with a failure to consummate the merger. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’
obligations to consummate the merger will be satisfied, and as a result there can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, even if the merger is
approved by Avalara shareholders. The Board noted the fact that, if the merger is not completed, (i) Avalara will have incurred significant risk, transaction
expenses and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to our operations, diversion of management and employee attention, employee
attrition and a potentially negative effect on our business and customer relationships, (ii) depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to
be completed and, given that Avalara’s recent second quarter financial results were below management’s expectations and, as a result, Avalara’s public
guidance would likely need to be revised, including a reduction in expected revenue and an increase, by a smaller amount, in non-GAAP operating
income, the price of Avalara common stock would likely decline, potentially significantly, and (iii) the market’s perception of Avalara’s prospects could be
adversely affected.
Restrictions on the operation of our business. The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the
merger, which could delay or prevent Avalara from realizing certain business opportunities or taking certain actions with respect to our operations that we
might otherwise take absent the pending merger.
Ability to respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals. The Board considered the fact that the merger agreement precludes us from actively soliciting
alternative proposals. The Board also considered, but did not consider preclusive, the fact that the right afforded to Parent under the merger agreement to
re-negotiate the terms of the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal may discourage other parties that might otherwise have an interest in a
business combination with, or an acquisition of, Avalara. The Board further considered the possibility that the termination fee payable to Parent if the
merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances might have the effect of discouraging alternative acquisition proposals or reducing the price
of such proposals. However, the Board also considered that the structure of the transaction as a merger would result in detailed public disclosure and
substantial time prior to consummation of the merger during which an unsolicited superior proposal could be submitted. In addition, the Board
considered the specific provisions of the merger agreement, which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, permit Avalara to furnish information to
and conduct negotiations with third parties that make unsolicited acquisition proposals, and permit the Board to change its recommendation to Avalara
shareholders regarding the merger agreement and to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior
proposal, in accordance
51
Table of Contents
with the terms of the merger agreement and subject to payment of a termination fee to Parent. The Board further considered its belief that the $242.329
million termination fee (which is equivalent to approximately 2.75% of equity value of Avalara) payable by Avalara (i) is reasonable in light of the overall
terms of the merger agreement and the benefits of the merger, (ii) was comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size, and (iii) would not
preclude another party from making a competing proposal.
Tax treatment. The Board considered the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to Avalara shareholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
Reverse termination fee. The Board considered the fact that, if it believed Parent and Merger Sub failed to consummate the merger when the closing of
the merger should have occurred pursuant to the merger agreement and Avalara was unable to obtain specific performance to compel Parent to perform
its obligations under the merger agreement, then Avalara’s only remedy is the right, in certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement and
receive a reverse termination fee of $484.659 million from Parent, which may not be sufficient to compensate Avalara for losses suffered as a result of a
breach or termination of the merger agreement by Parent.
Transaction costs. The Board considered the fact that Avalara has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in
connection with the merger, regardless of whether the merger is consummated.
Shareholder litigation. The Board considered the impact on Avalara of potential shareholder litigation in connection with the merger.
Potential differing interests of directors and officers. The Board considered that, aside from their interests as Avalara shareholders, Avalara’s directors
and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Avalara shareholders generally. See “The
Merger—Interests of Avalara’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger” beginning on page 65 of this proxy statement.
Other risks. The Board considered the types and nature of the risks and uncertainties set forth in Avalara’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year
ended December 31, 2021 and the subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and current reports on Form 8-K under
Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
While the Board considered potentially positive and potentially negative factors, the Board concluded that, overall, the potentially positive factors
outweighed the potentially negative factors. Accordingly, the Board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and
fair to, and in the best interest of, Avalara and its shareholders.
The foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Board in its consideration of the
merger, but it includes the material positive factors and material negative factors considered by the Board in that regard. In view of the number and variety
of factors and the amount of information considered, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not make specific assessments of, quantify, or
otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of the Board may have
given different weights to different factors. Based on the totality of the information presented, the Board collectively reached the decision to approve and
declare advisable the merger agreement and the merger in light of the factors described above and other factors that the members of the Board felt were
appropriate.
Portions of this explanation of Avalara’s reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and,
therefore, should be read in light of the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Board, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated August 8, 2022, that, as of the date of the
written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara’s common stock to
be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary of Avalara and the holders
of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara’s common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 8, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion
contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs provided
advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman
Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Avalara’s common stock should vote with respect to the merger, or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the merger agreement;
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Avalara for the four fiscal years ended December 31, 2021;
•
Avalara’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein last amended on June 13, 2018, relating to an
initial public offering of the shares of Avalara’s common stock;
•
Avalara’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein dated June 4, 2019, relating to follow-on public
offerings of the shares of Avalara’s common stock;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Avalara;
•
certain other communications from Avalara to its stockholders;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Avalara; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Avalara (which are referred to as the July Projections and the July Extrapolations and
summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Financial Projections” beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement) prepared
by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Avalara, which are referred to in this section of this proxy statement as the
“Forecasts”, and certain analyses related to the expected utilization by Avalara of certain net operating loss carryforwards of Avalara (which
are referred to in this section of the proxy statement as the “NOL Forecasts” and are also summarized in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Financial Projections” beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement) prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs’
use by Avalara.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Avalara regarding their assessment of the past and current business
operations, financial condition and future prospects of Avalara; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Avalara common stock; compared
certain financial and stock market information for Avalara with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded;
reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the software industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and
considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of Avalara’s board of directors, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting
53Table of Contents
and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that
regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of Avalara’s board of directors that the Forecasts and the NOL Forecasts were reasonably prepared on
a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of Avalara. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation
or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Avalara or any of its
subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the merger in any
way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger would be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement,
without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Avalara to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the merger as
compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Avalara; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara’s
common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary of Avalara
and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara’s common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the
merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with
the merger, or the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities,
creditors, or other constituencies of Avalara; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of Avalara, or class of such persons, in connection with the merger, whether relative to the $93.50 in cash per share of
Avalara’s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary
of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara’s common stock pursuant
to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and
stock markets on Avalara, Parent or the merger, or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of Avalara or Parent or the ability of Avalara
or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and
other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for
updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs’
advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of Avalara’s board of directors in connection with its consideration of
the merger and its opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Avalara’s common stock should vote with respect to
the merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board in connection with rendering the opinion
described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs,
nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of
the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone
not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is
based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 5, 2022, the last trading day before the public announcement of the
merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current or future market conditions.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Forecasts and the NOL Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow
analysis on Avalara to derive a range of illustrative present values
54
Table of Contents
per share of Avalara’s common stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 11.50% to 15.50%,
reflecting estimates of Avalara’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) estimates of
unlevered free cash flow (less stock-based compensation expenses) for Avalara for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022 and the fiscal years
2023 through 2042 as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Avalara, which were calculated by applying perpetuity
growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow (less stock-based compensation expenses) to be
generated by Avalara, as provided by Avalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Avalara management. Goldman Sachs derived such
discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Avalara’s target capital
structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for
Avalara, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of illustrative perpetuity growth rates for Avalara
was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding
long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. In addition, assuming discount rates ranging from 11.50% to 15.50%, reflecting an estimate
of Avalara’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 the estimated benefits of Avalara’s net
operating losses (“NOLs”) for the fiscal years 2022 through 2042, as reflected in the NOL Forecasts.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Avalara by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above.
Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Avalara the amount of Avalara’s total debt and debt-like
items and added the amount of Avalara’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022, as provided by Avalara management and approved
for Goldman Sachs’ use by Avalara management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Avalara. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of
illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Avalara’s common stock, as provided by Avalara management
and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Avalara management, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share
of Avalara’s common stock ranging from $54.74 to $112.95.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative
future value per share of Avalara’s common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a
company’s equity as a function of such company’s financial multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years
2022 to 2025. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise values for Avalara as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, by
applying a range of multiples of enterprise value to Avalara’s next twelve months (“NTM”) revenue (which is referred to as “EV/NTM revenue multiple”)
of 6.5x to 9.5x to estimates of Avalara’s revenue for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025. The range of illustrative EV/NTM revenue multiples was derived
by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples for Avalara
and current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples for certain publicly traded companies, as described below in the section captioned “Selected Public
Company Comparables Analysis.”
Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Avalara’s total debt and debt-like items and added the amount of Avalara’s unrestricted cash and cash
equivalents as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, each as provided by Avalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use
by Avalara management, from the respective enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity values as of December 31 for each of the
fiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares
of Avalara’s common stock for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, calculated based on estimated annual dilution and the number of fully diluted shares
of Avalara’s common stock, each as provided by Avalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Avalara management, using the treasury
stock method, to derive a range of implied future equity values per share of Avalara’s common stock. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied
future equity values per share to
55
Table of Contents
August 5, 2022 using an illustrative discount rate of 13.75%, reflecting an estimate of Avalara’s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate
by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain
financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $75.42 to $125.43 per share
of Avalara’s common stock.
Selected Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions in the
software industry since 2013. For each of the selected transactions where information was publicly available, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the
implied EV/NTM revenue multiple of the applicable target company based on the total consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target
company’s NTM consensus revenue based on Factset, IBES estimates or select Wall Street research at the time each such selected transaction was
announced.

While none of the companies in the selected transactions are directly comparable to Avalara, the companies in the selected transactions are companies
with operations, results, market sizes and product profiles that, for the purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Avalara’s
operations, results, market size and product profile.
Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ analyses of the various transactions and its professional judgment and
experience, Goldman Sachs selected a reference range of EV/NTM revenue multiples of 7.0x to 12.0x and applied such range to Avalara’s NTM revenue, to
derive a range of implied enterprise values for Avalara. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of implied enterprise values the amount of
Avalara’s total debt and debt-like items and added the amount of Avalara’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022, as provided by
Avalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Avalara management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Avalara. Goldman
Sachs divided the range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Avalara’s common stock, as provided by
Avalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Avalara management, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of implied equity
values per share of Avalara’s common stock of $79.08 to $132.25.
Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition transactions
announced during the time period from January 1, 2017 through August 5, 2022 involving a public company based in the United States as the target
where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were between $5 billion and $20 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available
information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in each of the transactions relative to the
target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 29% across the
period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 19% and 75th percentile premium of 49% across the period. Using this analysis and its
professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 19% to 49% to the undisturbed closing price per
share of Avalara’s common stock of $73.54 as of July 6, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Avalara’s common stock of
$87.51 to $109.57.

traded companies in the software industry with operations that for purposes of this analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Avalara.
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the enterprise value as of August 5, 2022 as a multiple of NTM revenue for each of the Selected Companies, in
each case based on financial and trading data as of August 5, 2022, information Goldman Sachs obtained from public filings, FactSet and Capital IQ,
publicly available historical and market data and Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System estimates (“IBES estimates”). This analysis resulted in a median
EV/NTM revenue multiple for the Selected Companies of 8.1x.

Avalara’s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary
of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara’s common stock pursuant
to the merger agreement.
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara’s common stock relative to:
•
$73.54, the undisturbed closing price for Avalara’s common stock on July 6, 2022, the last trading day prior to media reports regarding a

statement);
•
$76.93, the VWAP of Avalara’s common stock over the 1-month trading time period ended July 6, 2022 (which we refer to as the “1-month
Undisturbed VWAP” in this section of this proxy statement);
•
$79.11, the VWAP of Avalara’s common stock over the 3-month trading time period ended July 6, 2022 (which we refer to as the “3-month

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to Avalara, Parent or the merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Board as to the fairness from a financial point of
view of the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara’s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent,
Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding
shares of Avalara’s common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to
uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Avalara, Parent,
Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Avalara and Parent and was approved by the Board. Goldman
Sachs provided advice to Avalara during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to
Avalara or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in
connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.

Concurrent with Avalara’s issuance of the Convertible Notes in August 2021, Avalara entered into capped call transactions with respect to the
Convertible Notes (collectively, the “Capped Call Transactions”) with Goldman Sachs and four other counterparties (in such capacities, collectively, the
“Capped Call Counterparties”), each acting as principal for its own account. The Capped Call Transactions consisted of the purchase by Avalara of
capped call options with respect to collectively approximately 4,099,635 shares of Avalara’s common stock, the aggregate number of shares of Avalara’s
common stock underlying the Convertible Notes (at the initial conversion rate of 4.1940 shares of Avalara’s common stock per $1,000 in principal amount
of the Convertible Notes) (with 20% purchased from Goldman Sachs). The Convertible Notes had an initial strike price equal to $238.44 per share of
Avalara’s common stock, subject to an initial cap price of $323.30 per share. As of August 16, 2022, 100% of the Capped Call Transactions remain
outstanding, with a strike price of $238.44 per share and a cap price of $323.30 per share.
The Capped Call Transactions were intended to offset a portion of the potential dilutive effect on Avalara stockholders of the conversion of the
Convertible Notes and/or any potential cash payment in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes that Avalara may make in connection
with a cash settlement of the Convertible Notes, in each case, up to the cap price. The Capped Call Transactions, upon the exercise thereof, generally
require the Capped Call Counterparties to deliver to Avalara upon expiration of the call options, a number of shares of Avalara’s common stock (and/or in
certain circumstances, at Avalara’s election, cash) determined based on the excess, if any, of the lower of the cap price and the price of the shares of
Avalara’s common stock at that time (determined over a period specified in the Capped Call Transactions) over the strike price per share of Avalara’s
common stock.
The Capped Call Transactions may be adjusted, exercised, cancelled and/or terminated in accordance with their terms in connection with certain events.
In particular, under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, each of Goldman Sachs and the other Capped Call Counterparties, each acting separately
as calculation agent under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, is entitled in certain circumstances to make adjustments on more than one
occasion to the terms of such Capped Call Transactions to reflect the economic effect of the announcement of such events (including the merger) on the
embedded call options. In addition, each of Goldman Sachs and the other Capped Call Counterparties may, acting separately as the calculation agent,
determining party or otherwise as principal under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, determine such adjustments in respect of such
Capped Call Transactions in accordance with their terms, including on or following consummation or abandonment of such events. All actions or
exercises of judgment by Goldman Sachs, in its capacity as calculation agent, pursuant to the terms of the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party,
must be performed in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner.
As a result of the Capped Call Transactions, the Capped Call Counterparties are expected to have market exposure to the price of the shares of Avalara’s
common stock. It is the ordinary practice of the Capped Call Counterparties to engage in hedging activities to limit their respective market exposure to the
price of the stock underlying privately negotiated equity derivative transactions with issuers of such stock, such as the Capped Call Transactions. In
connection with the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, Goldman Sachs (and its affiliates) have engaged, and will continue to engage, in
accordance with applicable law in hedging and other market transactions (which may include the entering into or unwinding of various derivative
transactions with respect to Avalara’s common stock) that are generally intended to substantially neutralize Goldman Sachs’ exposure as a result of the
Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party to changes in the price of Avalara’s common stock. Such hedging activity is at Goldman Sachs’ own risk
and may result in a gain or loss to Goldman Sachs that may be greater than or less than the initial expected contractual benefit to Goldman Sachs under
the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party. The amount of any such gain or loss will not be known until the applicable Capped Call Transactions
have been exercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs shall have completed all of its hedge unwind activities. To
mitigate the exposure from the Capped Call Transactions, as of August 19, 2022, Goldman Sachs held a net long economic position of approximately
75,000 shares of Avalara’s common stock.

Table of Contents
Goldman Sachs provided to management of Avalara, for the information of the Board, materials that summarized, based on theoretical models, the
potential effects of the announcement and of the consummation of an acquisition of Avalara on the Capped Call Transactions. The materials included
preliminary illustrative analyses by Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division for a range of stated assumptions regarding takeout prices for shares of
Avalara’s common stock and volatilities, as well as based on other reasonable assumptions, in the event of an acquisition of Avalara for greater than 10
percent cash consideration. In accordance with industry practice, Goldman Sachs maintains customary institutional information barriers reasonably
designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by personnel in its Investment Banking Division to the personnel in its
Securities Division who are undertaking hedging and other market transactions with respect to Goldman Sachs’ capped call transactions. In connection
with the preparation of presentations to senior management of Avalara and the Board, personnel in Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division,
including the representatives of Goldman Sachs who have advised Avalara in connection with the merger, from time to time, have received or may receive
input from personnel in Goldman Sachs’ Securities Division into how to model, or reports of historical measures or estimates of, Goldman Sachs’ and/or
Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division’s profit and/or loss over certain measurement periods related to the Capped Call Transactions.
Goldman Sachs has advised Avalara that as of August 19, 2022, assuming the merger is consummated on December 31, 2022, Goldman Sachs expects to
realize a net gain of up to approximately $5 million with respect to the Capped Call Transactions as a result of the merger, after giving effect to its hedging
activities based on the ordinary hedging practices described above and based on a range of stated assumptions, including volatilities and other
reasonable assumptions. The amount of any such gain will not be known until the Capped Call Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in
accordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind activities, and such amount may differ from the
estimates provided above.
The indentures governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms of the Capped Call Transactions were included as
exhibits to Avalara’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 13, 2021, which contains additional disclosure regarding the Convertible
Notes and a description of the Capped Call Transactions. All references in this section to share counts, conversion prices, cap prices and strike prices are
subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with the terms of the confirmations relating to the Capped Call Transactions.
The Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated May 20, 2022, Avalara engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial
advisor in connection with the merger. The engagement letter between Avalara and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based
on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $75 million, $5.0 million of which became payable at the announcement of
the transaction, and the reminder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction. In addition, Avalara has agreed to reimburse Goldman
Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various
liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

In our press releases announcing quarterly and annual earnings, Avalara has historically prepared and provided certain public guidance as to its
projected financial and operational results for its then-current fiscal quarter and fiscal year. Avalara does not otherwise, as a matter of course, make public
projections as to future sales, earnings, or other results.
However, management of Avalara has prepared the prospective financial information set forth below to assist in the Board’s oversight of Avalara’s
financial and operational performance in the ordinary course of business. The accompanying prospective financial information was not prepared with a
view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
62Table of Contents
Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of Avalara’s management, was prepared on a reasonable basis,
reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of
action and the expected future financial performance of Avalara. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily
indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information.
Neither Avalara’s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to
the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its
achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.
To assist the Board’s oversight of Avalara’s financial and operational performance in the ordinary course of business, Avalara’s senior management
regularly prepares projections of Avalara’s financial and operational performance for the then-current fiscal year, which is updated for the Board each
quarter following the completion of the previous quarter, and the succeeding three-year period. In connection with the Board’s regularly scheduled April
26-27, 2022 board meeting, Avalara’s senior management prepared an updated version of certain unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal
years 2022 through 2024 that had been previously prepared for the Board’s regularly scheduled board meeting held on October 26 and 27, 2021 to take
into account Avalara’s performance for the remainder of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 and to include certain unaudited prospective financial
information for the 2025 fiscal year. In connection with the Board’s review of Avalara’s strategic alternatives, Avalara’s senior management prepared
certain unaudited prospective financial information in May 2022 (which we refer to as the “May Projections”) for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 that was
substantially the same as the unaudited prospective financial information prepared for the Board’s April meeting except for an increase in the projected
free cash flow. Following the completion of Avalara’s fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022, in connection with the Board’s regularly scheduled July 18-19,
2022 board meeting, Avalara’s senior management prepared an updated version of the May Projections to take into account Avalara’s performance in the
second quarter of 2022 and its impact for the remainder of the forecast period (which we refer to as the “July Projections”) and certain analyses related to
the expected utilization by Avalara of certain state and federal net operating loss carryforwards of Avalara (which we refer to as the “NOL Forecasts”).
The May Projections were made available to Vista and other potential bidders involved in the potential sale process in the course of their due diligence,
and the July Projections were made available to Vista in the course of its due diligence. Avalara’s senior management also prepared extrapolations of the
May Projections and the July Projections (the latter of which we refer to as the “July Extrapolations”) for fiscal years 2026 through 2042, which were
approved by the Board and provided to Goldman Sachs along with the May Projections and the July Projections. The July Projections and the July
Extrapolations were approved by the Board, and the NOL Forecasts were approved by Avalara’s senior management and provided to the Board, for
Goldman Sachs’s use for purposes of its financial analyses summarized above under “Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.” Goldman Sachs expressed
no view or opinion as to these financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based. A summary of the May Projections and the July
Projections (which we refer to collectively as the “Projections”) are set forth below.

The Projections are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented with numerical
specificity, the Projections are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by
Avalara’s management as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons,
including general economic conditions, competition, and the risks discussed in this proxy statement under the sections entitled “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 23. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject
to change. Because the Projections were developed for Avalara on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to the merger, they do not reflect any
changes to Avalara’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that the Projections will
be realized, and actual results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the Projections relate, the less
predictable and more unreliable the information becomes.
The Projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Avalara believes are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and future
results. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in
compliance with GAAP. While Avalara believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help investors understand
Avalara’s operating results and to analyze Avalara’s financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the
use of these non-GAAP financial measures, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Avalara may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts
used by other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are limited because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be
included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to,
financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures were relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its
financial analyses and opinion and by the Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor in
connection with a business combination transaction are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would
otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of
64
Table of Contents
non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs or Vista for purposes of its financial analyses and opinions or by the Board in
connection with its consideration of the merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures.
None of Avalara or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ
from the Projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Projections to reflect circumstances
existing after the date the Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions
underlying the Projections, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Avalara does not intend to make
publicly available any update or other revision to the Projections, even in the event that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. Avalara has
made publicly available its actual results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 on Avalara’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC
on February 24, 2022 (and amended on May 5, 2022) and for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 on Avalara’s Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 6, 2022 and August 9, 2022, respectively. None of Avalara or its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, or other
representatives has made or makes any representation to any Avalara shareholder or other person regarding Avalara’s ultimate performance compared to
the information contained in the Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved. Avalara has made no representation to Parent, in the merger
agreement or otherwise, concerning the Projections.

Avalara’s non-employee directors hold RSUs and Options, and Avalara’s executive officers hold Options, RSUs, and PSUs. The merger constitutes a
“change in control” for purposes of the equity awards held by our non-employee directors and executive officers. The Options and RSUs held by non-
employee directors accelerate upon a “change in control” pursuant to their terms. Accordingly, any unvested Options and RSUs held by non-employee
directors as of immediately prior to the effective time will accelerate upon consummation of the merger. Equity awards held by our executive officers do
not automatically accelerate upon a “change in control” pursuant to their existing terms. However, as further described below, all Options (whether vested
or unvested) will be cancelled for cash consideration in connection with the merger, and certain “double trigger” acceleration benefits will continue to
apply to cash awards received in respect of unvested RSUs and PSUs held by the executive officers in connection with the merger (as further described
below).
Options, RSUs, and PSUs will be treated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides for the following:
•
Options: Each outstanding and unexercised Option, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a
cash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such Option multiplied by (ii) the
excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over the exercise price per share under such Option, less any applicable withholding
taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Each Option with an exercise price per share greater than or equal to the per share merger
consideration will be cancelled automatically at the effective time for no consideration.
•
RSUs: Each outstanding RSU that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time or that vests as a result of the
consummation of the merger will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes required to
be withheld by applicable law) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such vested RSU, multiplied by (ii)
the per share merger consideration. Each outstanding RSU that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be
converted into the contingent right to receive from Parent or Avalara a Converted Cash Award equal to (i) the total number of shares of
Avalara common stock subject to such unvested RSU multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, less any applicable withholding
taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Unless provided otherwise in the merger agreement, each such Converted Cash Award will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions that applied to the corresponding unvested RSU forfeited
immediately prior to the effective time. Each executive officer’s employment agreement provides that in the event the executive officer is
terminated by Avalara without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason” within 12 months following a change in control, the executive
officers’ outstanding
66Table of Contents
equity awards will accelerate. The parties to the merger agreement agreed that such qualifying termination provisions will continue to apply
to the Converted Cash Awards following the merger.
•
PSUs. Each outstanding PSU that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law) equal to (i) the total number of shares of
Avalara common stock subject to such vested PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement),
multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration. Each outstanding PSU that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time will be converted into (without interest) a Converted Cash Award with respect to an amount equal to (i) the total number of
shares of Avalara common stock subject to such unvested PSU (as determined in accordance with the merger agreement), multiplied by (ii)
the per share merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Each such Converted
Cash Award will have, and be subject to, the vesting terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement to the corresponding
unvested PSUs forfeited immediately prior to the effective time. The time-vesting schedule and qualifying termination acceleration
provisions applicable to the executive officers are further described below.
•
There are two groups of unvested PSU awards outstanding: (i) unvested PSUs with an initial performance period commencing on
January 1, 2021 (the “2021 PSUs”) and (ii) unvested PSUs with an initial performance period commencing on January 1, 2022 (the
“2022 PSUs”). Pursuant to the time-vesting schedule set forth in each executive officer’s PSU award agreement, the Converted Cash
Awards will time-vest in substantially equal quarterly installments over the remaining performance periods applicable to the original
PSU award. More specifically, vesting will commence on the first quarterly date following closing of the merger, and will end on
January 5, 2024 for the 2021 PSUs and January 5, 2025 for the 2022 PSUs. Vesting is generally contingent upon each executive officer’s
continued employment through each applicable vesting date, subject to full acceleration upon an executive officer’s termination of
employment by Avalara without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason,” in each case, within 12 months following closing of
the merger.
•
For purposes of the merger agreement, the number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to the unvested PSU will be calculated
as follows: (i) with respect to the 2021 PSUs, calculated assuming performance was achieved at 220% of target, and (ii) with respect to
the 2022 PSUs, calculated assuming performance was achieved at 147.5% of target, in each case, subject to reducing such calculated
number of shares by the number of vested PSUs earned for a previously completed performance period. However, the calculation
method in the immediately preceding sentence (the “Merger Agreement Method”) will only apply if the holder of the unvested PSU
executes a waiver agreement prior to closing. If the holder does not execute a waiver agreement, then the total number of shares of
Avalara common stock subject to such holder’s unvested PSU will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the holder’s PSU
award agreement. With respect to the executive officers, if the terms of their PSU award agreements apply (in lieu of the Merger
Agreement Method), the number of shares subject to the unvested PSUs will be calculated as follows: (a) if the effective time occurs
prior to the end of the first performance period, calculated assuming performance was achieved at target, (b) if the effective time
occurs on or after completion of a performance period but prior to the vesting date (i.e., the date the compensation committee certifies
performance), calculated based on actual performance, and (c) if the effective time occurs on or after the first performance period but
prior to completion of the third performance period, calculated assuming performance was achieved at the greater of (A) target minus
the number of vested PSUs earned for a previously completed performance period or (B) actual performance (based on performance
for an abbreviated performance period that ends with the close of the Avalara’s fiscal quarter coincident with or immediately prior to
the effective time) minus the number of vested PSUs earned for a previously completed performance period. However, the total
number of shares calculated shall not exceed 250% of the target PSUs granted.

Payments for Unvested Awards
For an estimate of the amounts that would be realized by each of our named executive officers in respect of their unvested equity awards see the “Golden
Parachute Compensation” section below. In addition, the estimated aggregate amount that would be realized by Avalara’s non-employee directors in
settlement of their Options and RSUs in accordance with the merger agreement is $2,729,531 (calculated based on unvested RSUs and Options
outstanding as of September 9, 2022, and assuming the effective time occurs on November 1, 2022).
Directors’ and Officer’s Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Avalara’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification, expense
advancement and insurance arrangements. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance”
beginning on page 95 for a description of such ongoing arrangements.

Severance Entitlements
Each executive officer is a party to an employment agreement that provides for severance benefits and certain equity acceleration benefits if terminated in
connection with or within 12 months following a “change in control” (as defined in the employment agreements). The merger constitutes a “change in
control” for purposes of the employment agreements.
Upon a termination by Avalara without “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason” within 12 months following a “change in control,” each
executive officer is entitled to the following:
•
an amount equal to a certain number of months of base salary, as follows: 18 months for Messrs. McFarlane and Mathradas and 12 months
for Mr. Tennenbaum and Ms. Pinney, payable in equal installments over such periods;
•
an amount equal to the executive officer’s target annual bonus for the calendar year in which the executive’s employment is terminated,
prorated for the number of full months worked in such calendar year prior to termination;
•
Company payment or reimbursement of COBRA premiums during a certain number of months, as follows: 18 months for Mr. McFarlane and
12 months for Messrs. Mathradas and Tennenbaum and Ms. Pinney (or until the executive is no longer entitled to COBRA continuation
coverage, if earlier); and
•
full acceleration of outstanding time-based equity awards.
In each case, severance payments and benefits are subject to the executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor
of Avalara, and the executive officer’s continued compliance with his or her proprietary information and inventions agreement.
•
“Cause” generally means one or more of the following events: (i) the executive officer’s gross negligence with respect to our business and
affairs; (ii) the executive officer’s willful disregard or neglect of duties, including the violation of any material Avalara policy, following
written notice from Avalara; (ii) the executive officer’s act, or omission to act, intended to cause harm or damage to Avalara (including
reputational damage); (iv) the executive officer’s material breach of any written agreement with Avalara that is not timely cured (to the extent
susceptible to cure); (v) the executive officer’s act of embezzlement, fraud, theft, and/or financial dishonesty with respect to Avalara; (vi) the
executive officer’s breach of fiduciary obligations or disloyalty to Avalara; (vii) the executive officer’s material breach of the proprietary
information and inventions agreement with Avalara; or (viii) the executive officer’s conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a
felony or a crime involving theft, fraud, dishonesty, misrepresentation, or sexual harassment. The existence or non-existence of “cause” will
be determined in good faith by Avalara’s board of directors.
68Table of Contents
•
“Good Reason” generally means, without the executive officer’s written consent (and subject to certain customary notice and cure periods),
(i) any material breach by Avalara of the employment agreement; (ii) a material reduction in the level of responsibility, duties, or authority;
(iii) a material reduction in then-in-effect base salary (other than a reduction that is equal in percentage to, or smaller than, that imposed
upon Avalara’s other Company executives); or (iv) a relocation of the named executive officer’s principal office to a location more than 50
miles from the executive officer’s then-current principal office.
Equity Acceleration Benefits
Each executive officer is entitled to certain “double trigger” acceleration benefits upon a qualifying termination. See “Treatment of Director and Executive
Officer Equity Awards” for additional details.
280G Mitigation Actions
Avalara may, in consultation with Parent, take certain tax-planning actions before the closing to mitigate the amount of potential “excess parachute
payments” for “disqualified individuals” (each as defined in Section 280G) (“280G Mitigation Actions”). Such tax-planning actions may include, without
limitation, (i) if Avalara reasonably determines that the effective time will not occur in 2022, the payment in 2022 of short-term cash incentive
compensation (based on actual performance) that would otherwise be payable in 2023, (ii) if Avalara reasonably determines that the effective time will not
occur in 2022, accelerated vesting and settlement of equity-based awards that would otherwise vest in 2023 (based on actual performance in the case of
any performance-based equity-based awards), and (iii) obtaining third-party valuations of restrictive covenants. However, in no event will Avalara or any
of its subsidiaries provide any employee or other service provider with a tax gross-up or other indemnification for any such adverse tax consequences.
As of the date of this proxy statement, Avalara has not approved specific 280G Mitigation Actions, but such 280G Mitigation Actions may be approved
on a later date.
Quantification of Potential Merger-Related Payments to Named Executive Officers
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates
to, the merger that will or may become payable to each named executive officer of Avalara in connection with the merger. For additional details regarding
the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption “Interests of Avalara’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger” above.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on several assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the effective
date of the merger, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may
occur prior to completion of the merger. The calculations in the table below do not include amounts the named executive officers were already entitled to
receive or were vested in as of September 9, 2022. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the per share value of Avalara common stock was based on
the per share merger consideration ($93.50 per share) and the following assumptions were used:
•
the effective date of the merger is November 1, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for purposes of the
disclosure in this section;
•
the employment of each named executive officer will have been terminated by Avalara or an affiliate without “cause” or by the executive for
“good reason” (as such terms are defined in each named executive officer’s employment agreement) (a “qualifying termination”)
immediately following the assumed date of closing of the merger;
•
each named executive officer’s base salary and annual target bonus remains unchanged from those in place as of September 9, 2022;
69
Table of Contents
•
each named executive officer holds only those equity awards that were outstanding and unvested on September 9, 2022, and the value of
the cash award to be received in respect of unvested PSUs pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement is calculated using the Merger
Agreement Method; and
•
Any outstanding RSUs and Options that are expected to vest in accordance with their terms prior to November 1, 2022 will vest; no
outstanding PSUs will vest in accordance with their terms prior to closing.
As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described
in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
For purposes of this discussion, “single-trigger” refers to benefits that arise solely as a result of the closing, and “double-trigger” refers to benefits that
arise as a result of the closing accompanied by a qualifying termination immediately following the closing.

Cash. The amount set forth in this column include the following cash severance payments and benefits, as provided for under the employment
agreements described above. The cash severance payments and benefits include the following: (i) 18 months (for Messrs. McFarlane and
Mathradas) and 12 months (for Mr. Tennenbaum and Ms. Pinney) of continued base salary payments ($900,000 for Mr. McFarlane, $697,500 for Mr.
Mathradas, $435,000 for Mr. Tennenbaum, and $390,000 for Ms. Pinney, and (ii) a prorated portion of the executive’s target annual bonus (based on
the number of full months completed during 2022 prior to executive’s termination of employment) ($493,750 for Mr. McFarlane, $343,063 for Mr.
Mathradas, $295,313 for Mr. Tennenbaum, and $230,250 for Ms. Pinney). The cash severance payments and benefits included in this column are

Equity. The amounts in this table represent the value of the cash consideration (including the Converted Cash Awards) to be received in respect of
unvested RSUs, PSUs, and Options held by the named executive officers as of September 9, 2022 pursuant to the merger agreement (as described in
the “Treatment of Director and Executive Officer Equity Awards” section described above). The amounts set forth below in respect of the unvested
Options constitute “single-trigger” payments, as such amounts will be paid to participants in connection with the effective time. The amounts set
forth below in respect of the unvested RSUs and PSUs constitute “double-trigger” payments, as such amounts represent the value of the
Converted Cash Awards to be received in respect of such RSUs and PSUs awards, which will accelerate upon a qualifying termination following the
effective time.

Table of Contents
The number of PSUs set forth in the table below reflect the number of unvested PSUs outstanding at target level of performance, and the “PSU
Consideration” amounts set forth below were calculated using the Merger Agreement Method. More specifically, (i) we applied the specified
assumed performance rates (220% of target for the 2021 PSUs and 147.5% of target for the 2022 PSUs) to the total number of target PSUs originally
granted to each named executive officer, and then reduced such number of PSUs by the number of PSUs earned in prior performance periods, and
then (ii) multiplied such number of shares underlying the PSUs (as calculated under clause (i)) by the per share merger consideration.

Financing of the Merger",77,80

The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is not subject to any financing condition. It is anticipated that the total amount of
funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at the closing of the merger
by Parent and Merger Sub under the merger agreement, will be approximately $10 billion in cash. Parent has obtained equity and debt financing
commitments for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the aggregate proceeds of which, together with cash on hand at Avalara, will be
used by Parent to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all related fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub and to finance the fundamental
change offer for the Company’s outstanding convertible debt.
The Vista Funds, severally and not jointly, have committed, pursuant to separate equity commitment letters dated as of August 8, 2022 (the “Vista Equity
Commitment Letters”), to collectively capitalize Parent, at or prior to the effective time, with an aggregate equity contribution in an amount of $3.875
billion, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Vista Equity Commitment Letters. Certain institutional investors (together with the Vista
Funds, the “Investors,” and each, an “Investor”), severally and not jointly, have committed, pursuant to separate equity commitment letters dated as of
August 8, 2022 (the “Co-Investor Equity Commitment Letters” and together with the Vista Equity Commitment Letters, the “Equity Commitment Letters”),
to collectively capitalize Parent, at or prior to the effective time, with an aggregate equity contribution in an amount of $2.6 billion, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Co-Investor Equity Commitment Letters. Avalara is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment
Letters for the purpose of specifically enforcing Parent’s right to cause each Investor to fund or contribute, as applicable, its commitment under the
applicable Equity Commitment Letter, subject to (1) the limitations and conditions set forth in each Equity Commitment Letter and (2) the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement.
In addition, certain debt financing sources (collectively, the “Lenders”) have committed to provide Merger Sub with debt financing for the Merger
consisting of (1) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal
71Table of Contents
amount equal to $2.5 billion, and (2) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $250.0 million, in each case, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a commitment letter, dated as of August 8, 2022 and delivered to the Company simultaneously with the
execution of the merger agreement (as amended and restated on August 18, 2022, the “Debt Commitment Letter”). The obligations of the Lenders to
provide the debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of executed loan
documentation, accuracy of representations and warranties, consummation of the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement, and contribution of
the equity contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in certain limited guarantees (the “Limited Guarantees”), each dated August 8, 2022 and executed
concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, the Vista Funds (the “Vista Guarantors”) and certain institutional co-investors (collectively with
the Vista Guarantors, the “Guarantors,” and each, a “Guarantor”) have collectively guaranteed the payment obligations of Parent with respect to, (i) the
obligation of Parent under the merger agreement to pay the reverse termination fee if the merger agreement is validly terminated by the Company under
specified circumstances (see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”) and (ii) Parent’s obligation to pay certain interest and
expenses and certain reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under the merger agreement.
The Limited Guarantees will terminate upon, and the Guarantors will have no further liability or obligations under the Limited Guarantees from and after,
the earliest of (i) the effective time, (ii) the termination of the merger agreement by mutual written consent of Avalara, Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
Section 8.1(a) thereof, (iii) the termination of the merger agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b), 8.1(c), 8.1(d)(ii) or 8.1(f) thereof, (iv)
subject to the Guarantors Liability Limitations, the payment by the Guarantors of all amounts payable under the Limited Guarantee pursuant to their

U.S. Antitrust
Under the HSR Act, we cannot complete the merger until we have given notification and furnished information to the FTC and the DOJ, and until the
applicable waiting period has expired or has been terminated. On August 22, 2022, Avalara and an affiliate of Vista each filed a premerger notification and
report form under the HSR Act, as a result of which the applicable waiting period would be expected to expire on September 21, 2022, at 11:59 p.m., Eastern
Time, unless otherwise earlier terminated or extended by the antitrust authorities.
General
Under the merger agreement, each of Avalara and Parent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including (i) to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act and (ii) to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals required under or in connection with any Antitrust Law as soon as practicable. Subject to
certain limitations, Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to (i) resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or
objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under any Antitrust Law or (ii) avoid the
entry of, effect the

dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, order or judgment that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the contemplated transactions, so as to enable the parties to close the contemplated transactions expeditiously (but in no event later
than the End Date, as defined in the merger agreement).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates shall not be obligated to
take or agree to take any Remedial Action (as defined in the merger agreement) with respect to Parent’s or Merger Sub’s affiliates other than Parent,
Avalara, or their respective subsidiaries; and the parties shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to Avalara the effectiveness of which is not
conditioned on the closing of the merger occurring. Further, the parties agree to cooperate in all respects with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any administrative or judicial action or proceeding instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a
governmental entity or private party challenging the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement.
While we have no reason to believe it will not be possible to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, there is no certainty that these approvals will
be obtained within the period of time contemplated by the merger agreement, if at all.
The approval of any regulatory application or completion of regulatory review merely implies the satisfaction of certain regulatory criteria, which do not
include review of the merger from the standpoint of the adequacy of the consideration to be received by Avalara shareholders. Further, regulatory
approvals or reviews do not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of the merger.

"AVALARA, INC._20220912_DEFM14A_20334857_4516123.Pdf",Litigation Related to the Merger,"Litigation Related to the Merger
Two purported Avalara shareholders have each filed a complaint relating to the merger in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The complaints, captioned James Albrecht v. Avalara, Inc., et al., No. 22-cv-7486 (filed September 1, 2022) and Ryan O’Dell v. Avalara, Inc., et al., No. 22-
cv-7720 (filed September 9, 2022), each names Avalara and its directors as defendants and alleges, among other things, that the defendants filed or caused
to be filed a materially false and misleading preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek as relief, among other things, injunctive relief preventing defendants from filing a definitive proxy statement and from
consummating the merger unless additional disclosures are made, rescission of the merger in the event the merger is consummated or awarding of
rescissory damages, relief directing the defendants to account to plaintiffs for all damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations, and an award of
costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees.
Additionally, Avalara has received demand letters from purported Avalara shareholders seeking additional disclosures in the preliminary proxy statement.
Avalara believes the claims asserted in the lawsuits and the demand letters are without merit. Additional lawsuits and demand letters arising out of the
merger may also be filed or received in the future.

The exchange of Avalara common stock for cash in the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be
taxable under state, local, or other tax laws. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger” beginning on page 108) whose shares of Avalara common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize
capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to
such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.
73Table of Contents
You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 108 and consult your tax

Dissenters’ Rights",83,83
"AVALARA, INC._20220912_DEFM14A_20334857_4516123.Pdf",Dissenters’ Rights,"Dissenters’ Rights
General
Under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, instead of receiving the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the merger agreement,
holders of Avalara’s common stock are entitled to dissent from the merger and to obtain payment of the fair value of their shares in cash together with
accrued interest from the effective time if the merger is consummated. The following summarizes the material rights of holders of Avalara common stock
under Chapter 23B.13. You should read the applicable sections of Chapter 23B.13, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement, and
which governs dissenters’ rights. The summary below is qualified in its entirety by reference to Chapter 23B.13, and such statute, and not this summary,
governs the exercise of dissenters’ rights.
Pursuant to Chapter 23B.13.200 of the WBCA, when a proposed merger is to be submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, as in the case of the
special meeting, the meeting notice must state that shareholders are or may be entitled to assert dissenters’ rights under Chapter 23B.13 and must be
accompanied by a copy of Chapter 23B.13. The notice of the special meeting included with this proxy statement constitutes notice to the holders of
Avalara common stock of their dissenters’ rights, and a copy of Chapter 23B.13 is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.
If you are contemplating the possibility of exercising your dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger, you should carefully review the text of
Chapter 23B.13. If you do not fully and precisely satisfy the procedural requirements of Chapter 23B.13, you will forfeit your dissenters’ rights. If any
holder of shares of Avalara common stock who asserts dissenters’ rights under the WBCA withdraws or forfeits (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
the right to obtain payment for such holder’s shares under Chapter 23B.13, then such shareholder’s shares will be converted, or will be treated as if they
had been converted, into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding of taxes. Avalara will
not provide you with any notice regarding your dissenters’ rights other than as described in this proxy statement and the notice of the special meeting
included with this proxy statement.
Requirements for Exercising Dissenters’ Rights
If you wish to assert your dissenters’ rights, you must:
•
deliver to Avalara, before the vote is taken at the special meeting regarding the merger agreement, written notice of your intent to demand
payment for your shares of Avalara common stock if the merger is effected, which notice must be separate from your proxy. Your vote
against the merger agreement alone will not constitute written notice of your intent to assert your dissenters’ rights;
•
not vote your shares in favor of the merger agreement; and
•
follow the statutory procedures for perfecting dissenters’ rights under Chapter 23B.13, which are described below under the heading
“Dissenters’ Rights Procedures.”
74Table of Contents
If you fail to comply with these requirements, then if the merger agreement is approved by Avalara’s shareholders and the merger is completed, your
shares of Avalara common stock will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest and subject to any applicable
withholding of taxes, but you will have forfeited your dissenters’ rights with respect to your shares of Avalara common stock.
Written notice of your intent to assert dissenters’ rights must be delivered to Avalara at:
Avalara, Inc.
255 South King Street, Suite 1800
Seattle, Washington 98104
Attn: Corporate Secretary
(206) 470-7000
This written notice must be delivered before the vote to approve the merger proposal is taken at the special meeting. Your written notice to demand
payment should specify your name and mailing address, the number of shares of Avalara common stock you own, and that you intend to demand
payment of the “fair value” of your shares of Avalara common stock if the merger agreement is approved.
Vote
You must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the approval of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, by
proxy, via the Internet, by telephone, or in person, will constitute a waiver of your dissenters’ rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any
previously filed written notices of your intent to assert dissenters’ rights. A proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted
in favor of the approval of the merger agreement. Therefore, a shareholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise dissenters’ rights must vote
against the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the merger agreement.
Termination of Dissenters’ Rights
Your right to obtain payment of the fair value of your shares of Avalara common stock under Chapter 23B.13 will terminate if:
•
the merger is abandoned or rescinded;
•
a court having jurisdiction permanently enjoins or sets aside the merger; or
•
your demand for payment is withdrawn with Avalara’s written consent.
Dissenters’ Rights Procedures
If the merger agreement is approved by Avalara shareholders, within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, Avalara will send written notice
regarding the proper procedures for dissenting to all shareholders who have given written notice under Chapter 23B.13 to the address above and have
not voted in favor of approval of the merger agreement. The notice will:
•
state where the demand for payment and certificates representing certificated shares of Avalara common stock must be sent and when
certificates for certificated shares must be deposited;
•
inform holders of uncertificated shares as to what extent transfer of the shares will be restricted after the payment demand is received;
•
include a form for demanding payment that includes the date of the first announcement to the news media or to shareholders of the terms of
the merger (which was August 8, 2022) and requires that the person asserting dissenters’ rights certify whether or not the person acquired
beneficial ownership of Avalara common stock before that date;
75
Table of Contents
•
indicate the date by which Avalara must receive a payment demand, which date will not be fewer than 30 or more than 60 days after the date
the written notice is delivered to shareholders; and
•
include a copy of Chapter 23B.13.
If you wish to assert dissenters’ rights, no later than the date set forth in the notice described above you must demand payment, certify whether you
acquired beneficial ownership of your shares before August 8, 2022, and deposit your Avalara share certificates (or deliver your book entry shares) in
accordance with the terms of the notice. Failure to do so by the date set forth in the notice will cause you to forfeit the right to obtain payment of the fair
value for your shares under Chapter 23B.13.
If the merger is not consummated within 60 days after the date set for demanding payment and depositing share certificates, then Avalara will be required
to return all deposited certificates and release any transfer restrictions imposed on uncertificated shares. If, after returning the deposited certificates and
releasing transfer restrictions, the parties to the merger agreement wish to consummate the mergers, Avalara must send a new dissenters’ rights notice
and repeat the payment demand procedure.
Within 30 days after the later of the effective date of the merger or the date the payment demand is received, Avalara shall pay each dissenting
shareholder who complied with the payment demand and related requirements of Chapter 23B.13.230 of the WBCA (other than dissenting shareholders
who acquired their shares of Avalara common stock after August 8, 2022, if Avalara elects to withhold payment as described below) the amount that
Avalara estimates to be the fair value of the shareholder’s shares, plus accrued interest. For purposes of Chapter 23B.13, “fair value” with respect to a
dissenter’s shares, means the value of the shares immediately before the effective date of the corporate action to which the dissenter objects, excluding
any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action unless exclusion would be inequitable. “Interest” means interest from the effective
date of the merger until the date of payment, at the average rate currently paid by Avalara on its principal bank loans or, if none, at a rate that is fair and
equitable under all the circumstances. The payment will be accompanied by:
•
financial data relating to Avalara, including a balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year ending not more than 16 months before the date of
payment, an income statement for that year, a statement of changes in shareholders’ equity for that year, and the latest available interim
financial statements, if any;
•
an explanation of how Avalara estimated the fair value of the shares;
•
an explanation of how Avalara calculated the interest;
•
a statement of the dissenter’s right to demand supplemental payment if such shareholder believes that the amount paid is less than the fair
value of the shares or under certain other circumstances enumerated in Chapter 23B.13.280 and described below; and
•
a copy of Chapter 23B.13.
For dissenting shareholders who were not the beneficial owners of their shares of Avalara common stock before August 8, 2022, Avalara may elect to
withhold payment under Chapter 23B.13. To the extent that Avalara so elects, after consummating the merger, Avalara shall estimate the fair value of the
shares, plus accrued interest, and shall pay this amount to each dissenter who agrees to accept it in full satisfaction of the dissenter’s demand. Avalara
will send with its offer an explanation of how it estimated the fair value of the shares, an explanation of how the interest was calculated, and a statement of
the dissenter’s right to demand payment of the dissenter’s own estimate of the dissenter’s shares and the amount of interest due if such dissenter
believes that the amount offered is less than the fair value of the shares or under certain other circumstances enumerated in Chapter 23B.13.280 and
described below.
If you believe that the amount paid or offered by Avalara is less than the fair value of your shares or believe that the interest due is incorrectly calculated,
or if Avalara fails to make payment for your shares within 60 days
76
Table of Contents
after the date set for demanding payment or the merger is not consummated and Avalara does not return the deposited share certificates or release the
transfer restrictions imposed on uncertificated shares within 60 days after the date set for demanding payment, you may, within 30 days of the payment or
offer for payment, deliver notice to Avalara in writing informing it of your own estimate of the fair value of your shares and the amount of interest due,
and demand payment of this estimate, less any amount Avalara has already paid under Chapter 23B.13. If any dissenting shareholder’s demand for
payment of such dissenting shareholder’s own estimate of the fair value of the shares is not settled within 60 days after receipt by Avalara of such
shareholder’s demand for payment, Chapter 23B.13 requires that Avalara commence a proceeding in King County Superior Court and petition the court to
determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest, naming all the dissenting shareholders whose demands remain unsettled as parties to the
proceeding. If Avalara does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it will pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the
amount demanded.
The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced will be plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more appraisers to
receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers will have the powers described in the order appointing them, or
in any amendment to it. The dissenters are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings. The fair value of the shares as
determined by the court may be less than, equal to or greater than the value of the merger consideration to be issued to non-dissenting shareholders for
Avalara common stock under the terms of the merger agreement if the merger is consummated. Shareholders should be aware that investment banking
opinions as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a merger are not opinions as to fair value under Chapter 23B.13.
Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to a judgment (a) for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter’s
shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by Avalara, or (b) for the fair value, plus accrued interest, of the dissenter’s after-acquired shares for which
Avalara elected to withhold payment pursuant to Chapter 23B.13.
The court will also determine the costs and expenses of the court proceeding and assess them against Avalara, except that the court may assess the costs
against all or some of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not
in good faith in demanding payment under Chapter 23B.13. If the court finds that Avalara did not substantially comply with the requirements of Chapter
23B.13.200 through 23B.13.280 of the WBCA, the court may also assess against Avalara any fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective
parties, in amounts the court finds equitable. The court may also assess those fees and expenses against any party if the court finds that the party has
acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to dissenters’ rights. If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of
substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against Avalara, the court may
award to counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the dissenters who were benefited.
A record shareholder may assert dissenters’ rights as to fewer than all of the shares registered in the shareholder’s name only if the shareholder dissents
with respect to all shares beneficially owned by any one person and delivers to Avalara a notice of the name and address of each person on whose behalf
the shareholder asserts dissenters’ rights. The rights of a partially dissenting record shareholder are determined as if the shares as to which the dissenter
dissents and the dissenter’s other shares were registered in the names of different shareholders. Beneficial owners of Avalara common stock who desire
to assert dissenters’ rights as to shares held on the beneficial owners’ behalf (a) must submit to Avalara the record shareholder’s consent to the dissent
not later than the time the beneficial shareholder asserts dissenters’ rights, which consent shall be set forth either in a record or, if Avalara has designated
an address, location, or system to which the consent may be electronically transmitted and the consent is electronically transmitted to the designated
address, location, or system, in an electronically transmitted record; and (b) must so assert dissenters’ rights with respect to all shares of which such
shareholder is the beneficial shareholder or over which such shareholder has power to direct the vote.

The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement.
Factual disclosures about Avalara contained in this proxy statement or in Avalara’s public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update, or modify
the factual disclosures about Avalara contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary. The representations, warranties and covenants
made in the merger agreement by Avalara, Parent and Merger Sub were qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by Avalara, Parent and
Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated
with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to close the merger if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue, due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the
parties to the merger agreement, and were not intended by the parties to the merger agreement to be a characterization of the actual state of facts or
condition of Avalara, Parent or Merger Sub, except as expressly stated in the merger agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject
to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to shareholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in
some cases were qualified by disclosures that were made by each party to the other, which disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this
proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation
or warranty may have been included in this proxy statement or in the respective public filings made by each of Avalara or Parent with the SEC.

effective time (or the date, if any, on which the merger agreement is terminated by its terms), each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees not directly or
indirectly, to acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets or equity interests, or take any other action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the taking of any other action, would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the

materially increase the risk of any governmental entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting consummation of the transactions contemplated by the

subsidiaries’ operations prior to the effective time and nothing contained in the merger agreement gives Avalara the right to control or direct Parent or its
subsidiaries’ operations prior to the effective time.

subsidiaries will not, and will use reasonable efforts to cause their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
initiate, solicit, or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to, or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) or any inquiry, proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal (an “Acquisition Inquiry”);

approve, endorse, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse, or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or
•

Board expressly permitted under the merger agreement will not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a breach or violation of, or give Parent a
right to terminate the merger agreement.
Avalara also will, and will cause it subsidiaries to, and will direct and use reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective representatives to (i)
immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than the parties and their respective representatives) in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, in each case that existed as of August 8, 2022, (ii) promptly request each person (other

confidential information furnished to such person by or on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries prior to August 8, 2022 and promptly terminate all access
granted to any such person and its representatives to any physical or electronic data room and (iii) promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any

Avalara will promptly as practicable (and in any event within one business day following receipt thereof) notify Parent of Avalara’s receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or acquisition inquiry, which notification will include a copy (or, if not written, a summary) of the applicable Acquisition Proposal or
acquisition inquiry and the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or acquisition inquiry. Avalara will then keep Parent reasonably
informed on a prompt and current basis (and in any event within one business day) of the status of any developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any such Acquisition Proposal or acquisition inquiry and the material terms and conditions thereof (including any change in price or form of
consideration or other material amendment thereto), including by providing a copy of all material documentation relating to such Acquisition Proposal or
acquisition inquiry. Neither Avalara nor any of its subsidiaries or representatives will enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person

communications to the shareholders of Avalara) or from making any legally required disclosure to shareholders with regard to the
transaction contemplated by the merger agreement or an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Board may not make a Change of
Recommendation except to the extent otherwise permitted by the merger agreement.

Proposal after August 8, 2022 that did not, directly or indirectly, result from or principally arise out of a material breach of the merger

or any of its subsidiaries’ properties, books and records and providing information or data in response to a request therefor by a
person who has made a bona fide Acquisition Proposal after August 8, 2022 that did not, directly or indirectly, result from or
principally arise out of a material breach of the merger agreement, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), if prior to and as a condition

good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, in response to a bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal that did
not, directly or indirectly, result from or principally arise out of a material breach of the merger agreement, that such Acquisition Proposal would
constitute a Superior Proposal, Avalara or its Board may, if the Board has determined in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable law, (x) effect a Change of Recommendation or (y) terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the merger agreement in order to enter into a
definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal; provided, that Avalara pays to Parent any company termination payment required to
be paid pursuant to the merger agreement; provided, further, that, no such action described in clauses (x) and/or (y) above will be taken unless:
•
Avalara delivers to Parent a Company Notice (as defined in the merger agreement), advising Parent that the Avalara’s Board proposes to
take such action and containing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action of the
Board, 4 business days in advance;
•
after giving such Company Notice and as a condition precedent to taking any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, Avalara and its
representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent requested by Parent), to make such revisions to the terms of the
merger agreement, the guarantees and the financing commitments as would cause such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior
Proposal; and
•
at the end of the notice period, prior to and as a condition precedent to taking any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Board,
having taken into account in good faith any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the
Company Notice, has determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s) that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material revision, amendment,
update or supplement to the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a new Acquisition Proposal
and require a new notice by Avalara within 2 business days).
Prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Board may effect a Change of Recommendation if (x) an Intervening Event has occurred, and (y) prior
to taking such action, the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor(s), that failure to take
such action in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided, however, that prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation:
•
Avalara shall give Parent notice 4 business days in advance, which notice shall include the material facts of such Intervening Event;

•
after giving such notice and prior to effecting a Change of Recommendation, Avalara will negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent
requested by Parent), to make such revisions to the terms of the merger agreement, the guarantees, and the financing commitments; and

at the end of the event notice period, prior to and as a condition precedent to effecting a Change of Recommendation, the Board, having
taken into account in good faith any changes proposed in writing by Parent in response to the notice, shall have determined in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s) that (i) such Intervening Event remains in effect and (ii) the
failure to effect a change of recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
For purposes of the merger agreement “Acquisition Proposal” means:
•
any proposal or offer from any person or “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective affiliates) relating to (a) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related transactions of (i)
a business that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of
the consolidated total assets of Avalara and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) 20% or more of the voting power of the equity

owning 20% or more of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Avalara; or (c) any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Avalara (or any subsidiary of the
Avalara whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income, or fair market value (as determined in good faith by the
Board) of the consolidated total assets of Avalara and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole); in the case of each, except as contemplated by the
merger agreement.

any of the following actions by the Board: (A) failing to include a recommendation that shareholders of Avalara vote in favor of the
approval of the merger agreement in the proxy statement (the “Recommendation”), (B) withdrawing, modifying, qualifying, amending or
changing the Recommendation, (C) failing to recommend in a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 against any

after the commencement thereof, (D) recommending, adopting or approving any Acquisition Proposal, or (E) formally resolving to effect or
publicly announce an intention or resolution to effect any of the foregoing.

any event, development, change, effect, fact, circumstance or occurrence, in each case, with respect to Avalara and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, and not Parent, Merger Sub or their affiliates (and in each case excluding any Acquisition Proposal, acquisition inquiry or Superior
Proposal); provided, that (a) such event, development, change, effect, fact, circumstance or occurrence was not known (and should not
reasonably have been known) and was not reasonably foreseeable by the Board prior to the date of the merger agreement (or if known or
reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of August 8, 2022),
but which becomes known to the Board after August 8, 2022 and before the Company Requisite Vote is obtained and (b) “Intervening
Event” will not include (i) any change in the market price, or change in trading volume, of shares, in and of itself (it being understood that
the underlying causes of any such changes or developments may, if they are not otherwise excluded from the definition of “Intervening
Event”, be taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred) and (ii) any change

For purposes of the merger agreement “Superior Proposal” means:
•
a bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal (except that the references in the definition thereof to “20% or more” shall be deemed to be

good faith, after taking into account all financing, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal (including the identity of the person
making the proposal) (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and (y) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the shareholders of Avalara (in their capacity as such) than the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in each case after taking into account all such factors and matters deemed relevant in
good faith by the Board, including legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory, certainty of closing,
timing or other aspects of such proposal and the transactions contemplated hereby and after taking into account any changes to the terms
of the merger agreement offered in writing by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal.

From the period beginning on the effective time and ending on December 31, 2023 (or, if sooner, the date on which the employment of the relevant
continuing employee is terminated), Parent shall, or shall cause the surviving corporation to provide, to each employee of Avalara or its subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the effective time who continues to be employed by the surviving corporation or any subsidiary thereof:
•
a salary, wage, and target annual cash bonus opportunity that, in each case, is no less favorable than the salary, wage, and target annual
cash bonus opportunity that was provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time; and
•
employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension, post-employment welfare and nonqualified deferred
compensation benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits (subject to the same exclusions) provided to such
continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time.
From the effective time to December 31, 2023, Parent or one of its affiliates shall maintain for the benefit of each continuing employee a severance or
termination arrangement no less favorable than the severance benefits described in Avalara’s disclosure letter. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if the effective time occurs prior to the date on which annual bonuses in respect of the 2022 calendar year are paid by Avalara, Parent shall
cause Avalara to honor Avalara’s annual bonus plans that relate to the 2022 calendar year, and shall pay to eligible employees bonuses earned thereunder
pursuant to the terms thereof based on actual achievement of the applicable Avalara and individual performance objectives and goals set forth therein
consistent with past practice.
To the extent that Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plan in which continuing employees participate, Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the
surviving corporation and any subsidiaries thereof) shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing conditions,
exclusions, limitations, actively-at-work requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its subsidiaries to be
waived with respect to continuing employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such conditions or limitation were waived or did not apply under
the analogous employee benefits plan immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) give each continuing employee credit under the group health plan of
Parent or its subsidiaries for the plan year in which the effective time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical
expenses incurred prior to the effective time for which payment has been made and credited under the analogous Company Plan and (iii) to the extent that
it would not result in a duplication of benefits or compensation and to the same extent and for the same purpose that such service was recognized under a
similar employee benefits plan, give each Continuing Employee service credit for such continuing employee’s employment with Avalara prior to the
effective time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under
each applicable Parent benefit plan as if such service had been performed with Parent.
Nothing in the merger agreement shall confer upon any continuing employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the surviving
corporation, or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the surviving corporation, or any affiliate of Parent,
which rights are expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any continuing employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or

From the effective time, the surviving corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present
and former (in each case as of the effective time) director and officer of Avalara or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened action, arising out of, relating to or in connection with matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
effective time (including the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of Avalara or any of its subsidiaries or any acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to occur prior to the effective time), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time, to the fullest extent that Avalara would have
been permitted under Washington law to indemnify such person (and Parent or the surviving corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any action, including any expenses incurred in enforcing such person’s rights under the merger
agreement, regardless of whether indemnification with respect to or advancement of such expenses is authorized under the articles of incorporation, the
bylaws or the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any subsidiary; provided, that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification
pursuant to the merger agreement); provided, further, that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officer’s or director’s
conduct complies with the standards set forth under Washington law and Avalara’s articles of incorporation and bylaws shall be made by independent
counsel selected by the surviving corporation. In the event of any such action (x) neither Parent nor the surviving corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any action in which indemnification could be sought by such indemnified party hereunder, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or such indemnified party otherwise consents, and (y) the surviving
corporation shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In the
95Table of Contents
event any action is brought against any indemnified party and in which indemnification could be sought by such indemnified party under the merger
agreement, (i) the surviving corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the effective time (it being understood that, by electing to
control the defense thereof, the surviving corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the indemnified party’s entitlement to
indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) each indemnified party shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the surviving
corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such action, (iii) the surviving corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel
retained by an indemnified party promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the surviving corporation shall elect to control the
defense of any such action, and (iv) no indemnified party shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent.
Any indemnified party who wishes to claim indemnification under the merger agreement, upon learning of any such action, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the surviving corporation of any liability it may have to such indemnified party except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party.
The provisions in the surviving corporation’s articles of incorporation and bylaws with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall be no less favorable to such directors and officers than such provisions contained in
Avalara’s articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect as of August 8, 2022, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years after the effective time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.
Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the surviving corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six years from the
effective time the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Avalara (provided, that
Parent or the surviving corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less
advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time and from insurance carriers having
at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to the merger
agreement, Parent and the surviving corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by Avalara for
coverage for its last full fiscal year prior to August 8, 2022 (the “Current Premium”), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Avalara shall purchase from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, no later than
the effective time, a six-year prepaid “tail policy” providing at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the persons covered by the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and the insureds covered by the current
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Avalara and its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the
effective time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, and from insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance; provided, however, that in no event shall the amount paid for such prepaid policies exceed 350% of the Current
Premium. In the event Avalara elects to purchase such a “tail policy”, the surviving corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the surviving corporation
to) maintain such “tail policy” in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder. Parent agrees to honor and perform
under, and to cause the surviving corporation to honor and perform under, all indemnification agreements entered into by Avalara or any of its
subsidiaries with any indemnified party which are set forth in Avalara’s disclosure letter and made available to Parent prior to the date of the merger
agreement.
If Parent or the surviving corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that

the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume or succeed to all of the obligations set forth in the merger agreement.
The rights of the indemnified parties under the merger agreement will be in addition to any rights such indemnified parties may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of Avalara or the comparable governing instruments of any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or laws.
Nothing in the merger agreement is intended to, will be construed to or will release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims
under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to Avalara or its officers, directors, and employees, it being understood that the
indemnification provided for in the merger agreement is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

proposal.” For a detailed discussion of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, see “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 78. A copy of
the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. See also “The Merger” beginning on page 32.
The Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Avalara and Avalara shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the
merger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger in accordance with the WBCA, (ii) adopted the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, in accordance with the WBCA, and (iii) adopted a resolution recommending the merger
agreement be approved by Avalara shareholders.
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of
Avalara common stock entitled to vote thereon. If you abstain, or if you fail to vote (or submit voting instructions to your bank, broker, or other nominee,

In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Avalara is providing its shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on
the compensation that will be paid or may become payable to the named executive officers of Avalara in connection with the merger, the value of which is
set forth in the table entitled “Golden Parachute Compensation” in the section entitled the “The Merger—Interests of Avalara’s Executive Officers and
Directors in the Merger—280G Mitigation Actions—Quantification of Potential Merger-Related Payments to Named Executive Officers” beginning on
page 65. This proposal, commonly known as “say-on-golden parachute,” is referred to in this proxy statement as the named executive officer merger-
related compensation advisory proposal. As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Avalara is asking its shareholders to vote on the approval of
the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Avalara’s named executive officers in connection with the merger, as
disclosed under “The Merger—Interests of Avalara’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger—Quantification of Potential Merger-Related
Payments to Named Executive Officers,” as reflected in the table captioned “Golden Parachute Compensation,” the associated footnotes and
narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger
proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation
advisory proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal is only
advisory in nature, it will not be binding on Avalara, Parent, Merger Sub, or the surviving corporation. Because Avalara is contractually obligated to make
the potential merger-related payments to the executive officers, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the
merger proposal is approved and the closing of the merger occurs and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.
Approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal requires that the number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal
exceeds the number of votes “AGAINST” the proposal. Abstentions will not be considered a vote cast on the named executive officer merger-related
compensation advisory proposal, and will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, if you hold your shares in
“street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Avalara common stock will have no effect on
the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal because such shares are not deemed present and entitled to
vote on the matter under Washington law.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal.

(PROPOSAL 3)
Avalara shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give us authority from the shareholders to adjourn the special meeting for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
merger proposal or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the proxy statement is timely provided to Avalara shareholders, which we refer to as
the “adjournment proposal”. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the shareholders holding a majority in voting power of the outstanding
shares of Avalara common stock, present in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting, may adjourn the
special meeting to another place, date, or time. Assuming a quorum is present, the number of votes case “FOR” the adjournment proposal must exceed
the number of votes case “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the adjournment proposal.
In addition, the Board could postpone the special meeting before it commences. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies, shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the
proposals. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the
adjournment proposal. Avalara does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal has been approved at the special meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under the merger agreement, Avalara may adjourn or postpone the special meeting without Parent’s consent only in
certain specified circumstances as described further under “The Merger Agreement—The Special Meeting and Related Actions” beginning on page 92.
Approval of the adjournment proposal requires that the number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast “AGAINST” the
proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, abstentions will not be considered a vote cast on the adjournment proposal. Assuming a
quorum is present, if you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee on how to vote your shares of
Avalara common stock will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal because such shares are not deemed present and entitled to vote
on the matter under Washington law.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER",115,117

The following summary is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to “U.S. holders” and “non-U.S.
holders” (in each case, as defined below) whose shares of Avalara common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger. This summary
is based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial
authority, and administrative rulings, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax
consequences to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (collectively, “holders”) as described herein. No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
has been or will be sought with respect to any aspect of the merger. This summary is for the general information of the holders only and does not purport
to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects of the merger. For example, it does not consider the effect of the Medicare tax on net investment
income, of any applicable state, local or foreign income tax laws, or of any non-income tax laws. This summary applies only to holders that hold their
Avalara common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this
discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of the holder’s particular
circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:
•
a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution;
•
a tax-exempt organization;
•
a governmental agency or instrumentality;
•
a retirement plan, individual retirement account or other tax-deferred account;
•
an entity or arrangement treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership, S corporation or other pass-through entity (or an
investor in such an entity or arrangement);
•
a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company;
•
a dealer or broker in stocks and securities or currencies;
•
a trader in securities that elects mark-to-market treatment;
•
a holder subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code;
•
a holder that received its shares through the exercise of an employee stock option, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as
compensation;
•
a U.S. holder that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;
•
a “controlled foreign corporation,” “passive foreign investment company,” or corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax;
•
a holder that exercises dissenters’ rights;
•
a foreign pension fund and its affiliates;
•
a holder that holds shares as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion, or other integrated transaction; or
•
a U.S. expatriate.
If an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Avalara common stock, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Avalara common stock
and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to them.
108Table of Contents
This discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice. Please consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to you in light of your particular circumstances, as well as any tax consequences of the merger arising under the U.S.
federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws, under “golden parachute” rules, under any state, local
or non-U.S. tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty.
U.S. Holders
General
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Avalara common stock that is:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons (as defined in
the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S.
Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.
The exchange of Avalara common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder
whose shares of Avalara common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted
tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Gain or loss will be
determined separately for each block of shares of Avalara common stock (i.e., shares of Avalara common stock acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction). If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of Avalara common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must
determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares of Avalara common stock that it holds. U.S. holders
who own separate blocks of Avalara common stock should consult their own tax advisors with respect to these rules.
Such gain or loss generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Avalara common stock
exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders are generally eligible for reduced rates
of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
In general, information reporting will apply to payments made to a U.S. holder in connection with the merger, unless the holder is an “exempt recipient.” A
backup withholding tax may apply to such payments if such holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or
fails to report in full dividend and interest income. To avoid backup withholding, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption may complete
and return IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a United States person (within the meaning of the Code), the taxpayer identification number
provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or credit against a
U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the U.S. holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.
109
Table of Contents
Non-U.S. Holders
General
For purposes of this discussion, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Avalara common stock (other than an entity or arrangement
classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder. Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of
Avalara common stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required
by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment in the United States);
•
the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of shares of
Avalara common stock for cash pursuant to the merger and certain other conditions are met; or
•
the non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of the Avalara common stock
at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger, and Avalara is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation”
within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year
period preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held Avalara common stock.
A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized as if the non-
U.S. holder were a U.S. holder, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. If such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may also
be subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower rate provided by an applicable
treaty). A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate provided by an
applicable treaty) on any gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year, even though the individual
is not considered a resident of the United States.
Generally, a corporation is a “United States real property holding corporation” if the fair market value of its “United States real property interests” equals
or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business
(all as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). Avalara believes it is not and has not during the five-year period preceding the merger been a
“United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to payments made to a non-U.S. holder in connection with the
merger effected within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless the beneficial owner certifies under
penalty of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial
owner is a United States person as defined under the Code), or such owner otherwise establishes an exemption.
A non-U.S. holder will not be subject to backup withholding if such holder properly certifies (e.g., on the appropriate IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-
8BEN-E, or other applicable IRS Form W-8) under penalty of perjury and in compliance with any IRS rules that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the applicable
withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States person as defined under the Code), or such
holder otherwise establishes an exemption.
110
Table of Contents
Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a non-
U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the non-U.S. holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.
THIS SUMMARY OF MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT TAX
ADVICE. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION
OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

If the merger is consummated, we will have no public shareholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of our shareholders,
including the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders. If the merger is not completed, Avalara shareholders will continue to be entitled to attend and
participate in Avalara’s annual meeting of shareholders.
As described in our proxy statement for our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, if Avalara holds its 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, shareholder
proposals for the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders must be received at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business on December
22, 2022, and must have satisfied the other conditions established by the SEC, including, but not limited to, Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. For any
proposal that is not submitted for inclusion in next year’s proxy statement, but is instead sought to be presented directly at the 2023 annual meeting of
shareholders, shareholders are advised to review our bylaws as they contain requirements with respect to advance notice of shareholder proposals not
intended for inclusion in our proxy statement and director nominations. To be timely, a shareholder’s written notice of the proposal or nomination must be
delivered to and received by our Corporate Secretary in accordance with Section 2.6.1 of our bylaws. Our bylaws require that such notice be given not
less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders, or in the
event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than 70 days after such
anniversary date, to be timely such notice must be delivered to and received by the Corporate Secretary no earlier than 120 days prior to the next annual
meeting and no later than the later of 70 days prior to the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which a public announcement of the
date of the meeting was first made. To be timely for the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder’s notice must be received by us between
February 8, 2023, and March 10, 2023. Such proposals should be delivered or mailed to the attention of our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive
office, which is Avalara, Inc., 255 South King Street, Suite 1800, Seattle, WA 98104. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or
postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder’s notice as described above.
These shareholder notices must contain information required by our bylaws. We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate
action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements. If a matter is properly brought before our next
annual meeting under the procedures outlined in this section, the proxy holders named by our Board will have the discretion to vote on such matter
without having received directions from shareholders delivering proxies to them for such meeting, provided, that our proxy statement for our next meeting
briefly describes the matter and how the proxy holders intend to vote on it.
In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under our bylaws with respect to advance notice of any nomination, shareholders who intend to
solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the company’s nominees for the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders in accordance with SEC
Rule 14a-19 must provide notice to the attention of our Corporate Secretary at the address above no later than April 10, 2023. Any such notice of intent to
solicit proxies must comply with all the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-19.

The Capped Call Transactions may be adjusted, exercised, cancelled and/or terminated in accordance with their terms in connection with certain events,
including the announcement or consummation of the Transaction. In particular, under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, each of Goldman Sachs
& Co. LLC and the other counterparties, each acting separately as calculation agent under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, is entitled
in certain circumstances to make adjustments to the exercise price of the embedded call options sold by the Company to Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and
the other counterparties to reflect the economic effect of the announcement of the Transaction on the Capped Call Transactions. In its capacity as
calculation agent, all actions or exercises of judgment by Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC pursuant to the terms of the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a
party must be performed in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-
K of the Company for the four fiscal years ended December 31, 2021; the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus
contained therein last amended on June 13, 2018, relating to an initial public offering of the Shares; the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1,
including the prospectus contained therein dated June 4, 2019, relating to follow-on public offerings of the Shares; certain interim reports to stockholders
and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available
research analyst reports for the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as
approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”) and certain analyses related to the expected utilization by the Company of certain net operating
loss carryforwards of the Company, as approved for our use by the Company (the “NOL Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the
senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of
the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company
with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations in the software industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts and the NOL Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation
or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the
Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement,
without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This
opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than the Excluded Holders) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the
$93.50 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any
other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or
entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, or the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith
by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the
Transaction, whether relative to the $93.50 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than the Excluded Holders) of Shares pursuant to the
Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the
Company, Parent or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the
Company or Parent

to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this
opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are
provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such
opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This
opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $93.50 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than the
Excluded Holders) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
Very truly yours,

transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), such transmittal
materials to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, (B) a copy of RCW Chapter
23B.13 and all information contemplated thereby, and (C) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred
Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to cause an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.
(ii) Certificates. Upon proper surrender of one or more Certificates to the Paying Agent, together with such duly completed and executed
letter of transmittal contemplated by Section 2.3(b)(i), each holder of record of one or more Certificates, if any, shall be entitled to receive,
and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time in exchange

message” or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the

the Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificates are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Merger Consideration may be
issued to such transferee or other Person if the Certificates formerly representing such Shares are properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer and presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and establish to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that any applicable transfer or other similar
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares
will only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
(v) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender (together, if applicable, with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as
applicable)) the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after
the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
(c) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the
former holders of Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings
as provided in Section 2.3(f)) upon delivery of evidence of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, without any
interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(b), and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of such holder’s claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender
of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Company, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(d) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
evidence of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented, and acceptable, to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, subject
to compliance with the procedures set forth in this Article II, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to
which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes).

converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.1(a), without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to Section 2.3(f) and such Shares shall not be deemed Dissenting
Shares, and such holder thereof shall cease to have any other rights with respect to such Shares. Each Dissenting Share shall no longer be outstanding,

receive only the payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) in

described on Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Closing Date occurs prior to the date
on which annual bonuses in respect of the 2022 calendar year are paid by the Company, Parent shall cause the Company to honor the Company’s annual
bonus plans that relate to the 2022 calendar year (the “2022 Bonus Plans”), and shall pay to eligible employees bonuses earned thereunder pursuant to
the terms thereof based on actual achievement of the applicable company and individual performance objectives and goals set forth therein consistent
with past practice.

(b) To the extent that Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plan in which Continuing Employees participate, Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation and any subsidiaries thereof) shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing
conditions, exclusions, limitations, actively-at-work requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its subsidiaries
to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such conditions or limitation were waived or did not apply
under the analogous Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit under the group health plan of
Parent or its subsidiaries for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical
expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made and credited under the analogous Company Plan and (iii) to the extent
that it would not result in a duplication of benefits or compensation and to the same extent and for the same purpose that such service was recognized
under a similar Company Plan, give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee’s employment with the Company prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under
each applicable Parent benefit plan as if such service had been performed with Parent.
(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.9 shall (i) be deemed or
construed to be an establishment, amendment or other modification of any Company Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program or
arrangement, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from amending, modifying or terminating any Company Plans or any
other benefit or compensation plans, programs or arrangements in accordance with their terms or (iii) create any claims, rights or benefits (including any
third-party beneficiary rights) in any Person, other than the Parties.",171,172

such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements contemplated by this Section 6.10(d), the Company shall purchase from
insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, no later than the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid “tail policy” providing at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the persons covered by the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance and the insureds covered by the current fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, and from insurance carriers
having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance; provided, however, that in no event shall the
amount paid for such prepaid policies exceed 350% of the Current Premium. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a “tail policy”, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail policy” in full force and effect and continue to
honor their respective obligations thereunder. Parent agrees to honor and perform under, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform
under, all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party which are set forth in Section
6.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter and made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.

shall assume or succeed to all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.
(f) The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall survive the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties and their heirs and representatives.
(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.10 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims
under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

the Financing Commitments and Definitive Financing Agreements and enforce their rights under the Financing Commitments to the extent necessary to

satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing). Parent shall, at the reasonable request of the Company, inform the
Company on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or Alternative Financing) (including
providing copies of final Definitive Financing Agreements to the extent reasonably necessary to allow the Company to monitor the progress of such

cause each Guarantor to use, their respective reasonable best efforts and as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event,
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources (the “Alternative Financing”) in an amount, when added to the portion of the Financing that is and remains available to Parent, sufficient to

issue discounts or incur an increase in pricing relative to the pricing or fee terms of the Debt Commitment as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
taking into account any flex terms, or (ii) seek equity financing from any Person other than the Equity Investors or in an amount in excess of the Equity
Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment as of the date hereof. As applicable, references in this Agreement (other than with respect to
representations in this Agreement made by Parent that speak as of the date hereof) (A) to Financing or Debt Financing shall include any

such Alternative Financing, (B) to the Financing Commitments or Debt Financing Commitments shall include any such Alternative Financing
Commitments and (C) to Definitive Financing Agreements shall include the definitive documentation relating to any such Alternative Financing. Parent
shall, promptly upon request, deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall
have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with any portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Financing Uses (in each case, redacted with
respect to fee amounts and, if applicable, flex provisions and any other economic terms, so long as such redaction does not cover terms that could
reasonably be expected to affect the conditionality, amount, availability, enforceability or termination of the Alternative Financing).
(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.16(b), Parent shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) notify the Company in writing of
the occurrence of any of the following, in each case to the extent Parent has actual Knowledge thereof: (i) termination, withdrawal, repudiation, rescission,
cancellation or expiration of any Financing Commitment, (ii) any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) under any Financing Commitment by any party to such Financing
Commitment, (iii) receipt by any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives of any written notice or other written
communication from any Debt Financing Source, any lender or any other Person with respect to any (A) actual, threatened or alleged breach, default,
termination, withdrawal, rescission or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any provision of any Financing Commitment (including
any proposal by any Debt Financing Source, lender or other Person to withdraw, terminate, repudiate, rescind or make a material change in the terms of
(including the amount of necessary to fund the Financing Uses by) any Financing Commitment) or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to any Financing Commitment with respect to their obligation to fund the Financing on the Closing Date or (iv) if for any reason Parent
in good faith believes that it is likely that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Commitments. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two Business Days, Parent shall provide the
Company with any and all information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in this Section 6.16(c).
(d) Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors shall not (without the prior written consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) permit or consent to or agree to (i) any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, reduction or other
modification or waiver of any condition, provision or remedy under, the Equity Financing Commitments (other than to increase the amount of Equity
Financing available thereunder), (ii) any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, reduction or other modification or waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Debt Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement solely to the extent that such amendment, restatement,
supplement, termination, reduction, modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to (A) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the
funding of the Debt Financing or would otherwise change, amend, modify or expand any of the conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt
Financing, (B) impair, delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of the Debt Financing or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (C) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue

likely to occur; or (iii) the early termination of the Financing Commitments or any Definitive Financing Agreement; provided, however, for the avoidance
of doubt and notwithstanding, anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent and Merger Sub may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify the
Debt Financing Commitments (x) solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had not
executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof and, in connection therewith, (y) reallocate the commitments and economic percentages
with respect to the appointment of such additional lenders, purchasers, investors, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other financing
sources or (z) otherwise modify or replace the Debt Financing Commitments to the extent such amended or replaced Debt Financing Commitments would
not violate the terms of this Section 6.16(d). Parent shall furnish to the Company

a copy of any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification, waiver or consent of or relating to the Debt Financing Commitments or the
Definitive Financing Agreements promptly upon execution thereof. For purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to representations in this
Agreement made by Parent that speak as of the date hereof), references to the “Debt Financing Commitment” shall include such document as permitted or
required by this Section 6.16 to be amended, restated, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified or waived, in each case from and after such
amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver.
(e) If the Debt Financing Commitment is replaced, amended, supplemented or modified, including as a result of obtaining Alternative Financing, or if
Parent or Merger Sub substitutes other debt financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing in accordance with this Section 6.16, Parent or Merger
Sub shall comply with their obligations under this Agreement, including this Section 6.16, with respect to the Debt Financing Commitment as so replaced,
amended, supplemented or modified to the same extent that Parent and Merger Sub were obligated to comply prior to the date the Debt Financing
Commitment was so replaced, amended, supplemented or modified. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.16 to the contrary, compliance by Parent
and Merger Sub with this Section 6.16 shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement whether or not the Financing is available and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are not contingent on Parent or Merger Sub’s ability to obtain the financing (or any alternative financing) or
any specific term with respect to such financing.

commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof and Parent or
Merger Sub, as applicable, will, directly or indirectly, continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid as and when they become due and

obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions. The Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent and other conditions to the obligations of the parties
thereunder to make the full amount of the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the
Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a condition
precedent as a result of actions taken or expected to be taken by Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, any other party
under the Financing Commitments or (iii) result in any portion of the Financing Commitments to be provided, funded or invested in accordance with the
Financing Commitments being unavailable on the Closing Date as a result of actions taken or expected to be taken by Parent or Merger Sub or, to the
Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, any other party under the Financing Commitments. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Article VII, (i) Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be
satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing necessary to fund the Financing Uses will not be made available to Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable,
in full, in each case, on the Closing Date, and (ii) as of the date hereof, Parent is not aware of the existence of any fact or event that would or would
reasonably be expected to cause such conditions to the Financing necessary to fund the Financing Uses not to be satisfied or the full amount of the
Financing not to be made available to Parent or Merger Sub in full on the Closing Date. Assuming the Financing is funded and/or invested in accordance
with the Financing Commitments, the Financing, together with cash on hand at the Company at the Closing (which, solely for purposes of making this
representation, shall be assumed to be the amount set forth on Section 4.8 of the Parent Disclosure Letter), will in the aggregate be sufficient to (i) pay the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and the other payments under Article II, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the Financing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of any outstanding
