Questions and Answers About the Merger
 
Q.
Why am I receiving this document?
 
A.
You are receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus because Independent, Rockland Trust, Merger Sub, East Boston and Meridian entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended from time to time, the “merger agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into
Meridian, with Meridian as the surviving entity (the “merger”), and as soon as reasonably practicable following the merger, Meridian will merge
with and into Independent, with Independent as the surviving entity (the “holdco merger”). Immediately following the holdco merger, East Boston
will merge with and into Rockland Trust, with Rockland Trust as the surviving bank (the “bank merger”, and together with the merger and the
holdco merger, the “mergers”). A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated
by reference herein. In this joint proxy statement/prospectus, we refer to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as
the “closing” and the date on which the closing occurs as the “closing date.”
 
1Table of Contents
In order to complete the merger, among other things:
 
 
•
 Independent shareholders must approve the proposed issuance of Independent common stock to holders of Meridian common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement in order to comply with applicable Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) listing rules (the
“Independent share issuance proposal” and such issuance the “Independent share issuance”); and
 
 
•
 Meridian stockholders must adopt the merger agreement (the “Meridian merger proposal”).
Independent is holding a special meeting of Independent shareholders (the “Independent special meeting”) to obtain approval of the Independent
share issuance proposal.
Independent shareholders will also be asked to approve the proposal to adjourn the Independent special meeting to solicit additional proxies (i) if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the Independent special meeting to approve the Independent share issuance proposal or (ii) if
adjournment is necessary or appropriate to ensure that any supplement or amendment to this joint proxy statement/prospectus is timely provided
to Independent shareholders (the “Independent adjournment proposal”).
Meridian is holding a special meeting of Meridian stockholders (the “Meridian special meeting”) to obtain approval of the Meridian merger
proposal.
Meridian stockholders will also be asked to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the merger-related compensation payments that will or
may be paid to the named executive officers of Meridian in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the “Meridian
compensation proposal”), and to approve the proposal to adjourn the Meridian special meeting to solicit additional proxies (i) if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the Meridian special meeting, to approve the Meridian merger proposal or (ii) if adjournment is necessary or
appropriate, to ensure that any supplement or amendment to this joint proxy statement/prospectus is timely provided to holders of Meridian
common stock (the “Meridian adjournment proposal”).
This document is also a prospectus that is being delivered to holders of Meridian common stock because, pursuant to the merger agreement,
Independent is offering shares of Independent common stock to Meridian stockholders.
This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the merger and the other proposals being voted on at the Independent
and Meridian special meetings. You should read it carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed materials allow you to have your shares of common
stock voted by proxy without attending your meeting. Your vote is important and we encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible.
 
Q.
What will Meridian’s stockholders receive in the merger?
 
A.
In the merger, Meridian stockholders will receive 0.275 of a share of Independent common stock for each share of Meridian common stock held
immediately prior to the completion of the merger.
Independent’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “INDB.” Independent will not issue fractional
shares of its common stock in the merger, but will instead pay cash for any fractional shares at a price determined by the volume weighted average
closing price of Independent common stock on NASDAQ for the five trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the
closing date of the merger, which is referred to herein as the Closing VWAP (the exchange ratio, together with cash received in lieu of fractional
shares of Independent common stock, if any, the “merger consideration”).

Table of Contents
Q.
What will Independent’s shareholders receive in the merger?
 
A.
In the merger, Independent shareholders will not receive any consideration, and their shares of Independent common stock will remain outstanding
and will constitute shares of Independent following the merger. Following the merger, shares of Independent common stock will continue to be
listed on NASDAQ under the trading symbol “INDB.”
 
Q.
What will happen in the merger?
 
A.
In the merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meridian, with Meridian as the surviving entity. In the holdco merger, which will occur as soon
as reasonably practicable following the merger, Meridian will merge with and into Independent, with Independent as the surviving entity. In the
bank merger, which will occur immediately following the holdco merger, East Boston will merge with and into Rockland Trust, with Rockland Trust
as the surviving bank.
Each share of Meridian common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares held as
treasury stock or shares owned directly by Independent in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like) will be converted into the right to
receive 0.275 (the “exchange ratio”) of a share of Independent common stock. After completion of the merger, (1) Meridian will no longer be a public
company, (2) Meridian common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and will cease to be publicly traded, and (3) the Meridian common stock will
be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). After completion of the holdco merger, Meridian will
cease to exist. Holders of Independent common stock will continue to own their existing shares of Independent common stock. See the information
provided in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Structure of the Merger” beginning on page 100 and the merger agreement for more
information about the merger.
 
Q.
How will the merger affect Meridian equity awards?
 
A.
The merger agreement provides that Meridian equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be treated as follows:
Stock Options. Each stock option, whether vested or unvested, will fully vest and be cancelled at the effective time of the merger. On the
closing date of the merger, East Boston or Meridian will pay to the holders of such stock options cash in an amount equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Meridian common stock provided for in each such stock option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the per
share cash equivalent consideration (as defined below) over (y) the exercise price. Any stock option for which the exercise price per share
of Meridian common stock provided for in such stock option exceeds the per share cash equivalent consideration will be cancelled at the
effective time of the merger without payment. The cash payment will be paid within five business days after the closing date of the merger,
without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of the merger agreement, “per share cash equivalent consideration”
means the product (rounded to the nearest cent) obtained by multiplying (i) the exchange ratio by (ii) the volume-weighted average trading
price of a share of the Independent common stock on Nasdaq for the consecutive period of five full trading days ending on the day
immediately preceding the closing date.
Restricted Stock Awards. Each share of restricted stock will fully vest at the effective time of the merger and be considered an outstanding
share of Meridian common stock entitled to receive the merger consideration. The merger consideration will be issued within five business
days after the closing date of the merger, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.
 
Q.
How will the merger affect the East Boston ESOP?
 
A.
The East Boston Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (which we refer to as the East Boston ESOP) will be terminated at least five
business days and no more than seven business days prior to the effective time of the merger. The East Boston ESOP is funded through a loan to
purchase shares of Meridian
 
3
Table of Contents
 
common stock, which shares are allocated to participants as the loan is repaid. The unallocated shares are held in a separate unallocated stock
fund. Participants’ account balances will become fully vested in connection with the termination of the East Boston ESOP. On the date the East
Boston ESOP is terminated, East Boston will direct the trustee of the East Boston ESOP to remit a sufficient number of shares of Meridian common
stock held in the ESOP loan suspense account back to East Boston to repay the outstanding ESOP loan in full. All remaining shares of Meridian
common stock held by the East Boston ESOP as of immediately prior to the effective time, including any unallocated shares held in the East Boston
ESOP loan suspense account (which will not include any shares of Meridian common stock used for purposes of repaying or forgiving the East
Boston ESOP loan) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. Following the effective time, the unallocated merger
consideration (and any other remaining unallocated assets) will be allocated on a pro rata basis to all participants with an account balance under
the East Boston ESOP based on each participant’s account balance on the termination date.
 
Q.
Will the value of the merger consideration change between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the time the merger is
completed?
 
A.
Yes. Although the number of shares of Independent common stock that Meridian stockholders will receive is fixed, the value of the merger
consideration will fluctuate between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the completion of the merger based upon the market
value for Independent common stock. Any fluctuation in the market price of Independent common stock will change the value of the shares of
Independent common stock that Meridian stockholders will receive. Neither Independent nor Meridian is permitted to terminate the merger
agreement as a result of any increase or decrease in the market price of Independent common stock or Meridian common stock.
 
Q.
Are Meridian’s stockholders or Independent’s shareholders entitled to dissenters’ rights?
 
A.
No. Under the provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended, Meridian stockholders are not entitled to dissenters’ rights in the
merger. Under the provisions of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, Chapter 156D, Section 13, Independent shareholders are not entitled
to dissenters’ rights in the merger.
 
Q.
Are there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the Independent share issuance proposal, the approval of
the Meridian merger proposal, or the other proposals to be considered at the Independent special meeting and the Meridian special meeting,
respectively?
 
A.
Yes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section in this document titled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 27.
You also should read and carefully consider the risk factors of Independent and Meridian contained in the documents that are incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
 
Q.
Should Meridian’s stockholders send in their stock certificates now?
 
A.
No. Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy. After the merger is completed, an exchange agent designated by Independent and
reasonably acceptable to Meridian (the “exchange agent”) will send you instructions for exchanging Meridian stock certificates for the merger
consideration.
 
Q.
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger to U.S. holders of Meridian common stock?
 
A.
The merger and the holdco merger, taken together, are intended to qualify, and the obligations of the parties to complete the merger are conditioned
upon the receipt of a legal opinion from their respective counsel to the effect that the merger and the holdco merger, taken together, will qualify, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is referred to in this joint

Table of Contents
 
proxy statement/prospectus as the Code. Meridian’s stockholders generally will not recognize gain or loss with respect to the Independent common
stock that they receive in the merger, except with respect to any cash they receive in lieu of receiving a fractional share of Independent common
stock. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and the Holdco Merger” beginning on page 121 . This tax treatment
may not apply to all Meridian stockholders. Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger to Meridian
stockholders can be complicated and will depend on the particular circumstances of each Meridian stockholder. Meridian stockholders should
consult their own tax advisor for a full understanding of the mergers’ tax consequences that are particular to each stockholder.
 
Q.
What are the interests of Meridian’s directors and executive officers in the merger, if any?
 
A.
In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Meridian, Meridian’s stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive
officers of Meridian have interests in the merger and holdco merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meridian’s other
stockholders generally. These interests include rights of certain executive officers under their existing employment and change in control
agreements; rights of certain directors and executive officers to payments of their vested account balances under their existing supplemental
retirement arrangements; rights of certain executive officers under consulting agreements and an offer letter with Rockland Trust executed in
connection with the merger agreement; rights under Meridian’s equity-based benefit programs and awards, including the acceleration of vesting of
stock options and restricted stock; a 2021 pro-rata bonus; a 2021 grant of restricted stock awards; rights under the East Boston ESOP; and rights to
continued indemnification and insurance coverage by Independent after the merger for acts and omissions occurring before the merger. In addition,
following the merger, Independent will invite all of the independent directors serving on Meridian’s board of directors immediately prior to the
merger to become members of a transition advisory board for two years following the closing. The board of directors of Meridian was aware of
these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and related transactions.
 
Q.
When will the merger be completed?
 
A.
Independent and Meridian expect the merger to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, neither Independent nor Meridian can predict the
actual date on which the merger will be completed, or if the merger will be completed at all, because completion is subject to conditions and factors
outside the control of both companies. Meridian must first obtain the approval of Meridian stockholders for the Meridian merger proposal, and
Independent must obtain approval of Independent shareholders for the Independent share issuance proposal. Independent and Meridian must also
obtain necessary regulatory approvals and satisfy certain other closing conditions.
 
Q.
What are the conditions to complete the merger?
 
A.
The obligations of Independent and Meridian to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions
contained in the merger agreement, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods without
the imposition of any materially burdensome regulatory condition, the receipt of certain tax opinions, approval by Independent shareholders of the
Independent share issuance proposal and approval by Meridian stockholders of the Meridian merger proposal. For more information, see “The
Merger Agreement—Conditions to Complete the Merger” beginning on page 115.
 
Q.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
 
A.
If the merger is not completed, holders of Meridian common stock will not receive any consideration for their shares of Meridian common stock in
connection with the merger. Instead, Meridian will remain an independent public company, Meridian common stock will continue to be listed and
traded on NASDAQ, and Independent will not complete the issuance of shares of Independent common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. In
addition, if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, a termination

fee of $44,145,000 will be payable by either Independent or Meridian, as applicable. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on
page 117 for a more detailed discussion of the circumstances under which a termination fee will be required to be paid.
 
Q.
Where can I find more information about the companies?
 
A.
You can find more information about Independent and Meridian from the various sources described under the section of this document titled
“Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 142.
 
Q.
What is a “broker non-vote”?
 
A.
A “broker non-vote” occurs on an item when a nominee or intermediary is not permitted to vote on that item without instructions from the beneficial
owner of the shares, and the beneficial owner fails to provide the nominee or intermediary with such instructions.
 
Q.
What is householding and how does it affect me?
 
A.
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two (2) or more shareholders reside, unless contrary
instructions have been received, but only if the applicable shareholders provide advance notice and follow certain procedures. In such cases, each
shareholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for
beneficial owners of Independent common stock and Meridian common stock, as applicable, held through brokerage firms. If your family has
multiple accounts holding Independent common stock or Meridian common stock, as applicable, you may have already received a householding
notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus promptly upon your written
or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

your vote will be counted if you later decide not to or become unable to attend the applicable special meeting.
 
Q.
What matters are Meridian’s stockholders being asked to approve at the Meridian special meeting pursuant to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus?

At the Meridian special meeting, Meridian’s stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

complete the merger.

Table of Contents
Q.
What does Meridian’s board of directors recommend with respect to the three proposals?
 
A.
The Meridian board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Meridian merger proposal, “FOR” the Meridian compensation
proposal and “FOR” the Meridian adjournment proposal.
In considering the recommendations of the Meridian board of directors, Meridian stockholders should be aware that Meridian directors and
executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meridian stockholders generally. For a
more complete description of these interests, see the information provided in the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Meridian’s Executive
Officers and Directors in the Merger” beginning on page 88.
 
Q.
Who is eligible to vote at the Meridian special meeting of stockholders?
 
A.
Only holders of record of Meridian common stock at the close of business on June 17, 2021 which is the record date for the Meridian special
meeting of stockholders, are entitled to vote at the Meridian special meeting.
Attendance at the special meeting is not required to vote. See below and the section entitled “The Special Meeting of Meridian Stockholders—
Voting of Proxies” beginning on page 46 for instructions on how to vote your shares of Meridian common stock without attending the Meridian
special meeting.
 
Q.
How many votes must be represented in person or by proxy at the Meridian special meeting to have a quorum?
 
A.
The holders of a majority of the shares of Meridian common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Meridian special meeting of stockholders,
present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Meridian special meeting.
 
Q.
What vote by Meridian’s stockholders is required to approve the Meridian special meeting proposals?
 
A.
Meridian Proposal 1: Meridian merger proposal. Approval of the Meridian merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Meridian common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Accordingly, an abstention or a broker non-vote or other failure
to vote will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Meridian Proposal 2: Meridian compensation proposal. Approval of the Meridian compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast by Meridian stockholders. Accordingly, an abstention or a broker non-vote or other failure to vote will have no effect on
the outcome of the Meridian compensation proposal.
Meridian Proposal 3: Meridian adjournment proposal. Whether or not a quorum will be present at the meeting, approval of the Meridian
adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by Meridian stockholders. Accordingly, an abstention or a broker
non-vote or other failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the Meridian adjournment proposal.
 
Q.
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, merger-related compensation arrangements
for the Meridian named executive officers (i.e., the Meridian compensation proposal)?
 
A.
Under Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules, Meridian is required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Meridian’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger or
“golden parachute” compensation.

Table of Contents
Q.
What happens if Meridian stockholders do not approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, merger-related compensation arrangements for Meridian’s
named executive officers (i.e., the Meridian compensation proposal)?
 
A.
The vote on the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation arrangements for each of Meridian’s named executive officers is separate
and apart from the votes to approve the other proposals being presented at the Meridian special meeting. Because the vote on the proposal to
approve the merger-related executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding upon Meridian or Independent before or
following the merger. Accordingly, the merger-related compensation will be paid to Meridian’s named executive officers to the extent payable in
accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and other contractual arrangements even if Meridian stockholders do not approve the
proposals to approve the merger-related executive compensation.
 
Q.
Are any Meridian stockholders already committed to vote in favor of any of the Meridian special meeting proposals?
 
A.
Under voting agreements with Independent, each of Meridian’s directors and executive officers who individually or jointly owns shares of Meridian
common stock, acting solely in his or her capacity as a stockholder, has agreed to vote all of his or her Meridian common stock in favor of the
Meridian merger agreement proposal. As of the record date for the Meridian special meeting of stockholders, the Meridian stockholders who are
parties to the voting agreements with Independent collectively owned (with sole or shared voting power) approximately 3.55% of the Meridian
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Meridian special meeting.

instructions that you must follow in order to vote your shares of Meridian common stock. You may receive more than one proxy card if your shares
of Meridian common stock are registered in different names or are held in more than one account. A broker, bank or other holder of record will not
be able to vote your shares at the Meridian special meeting without first receiving instructions from you on how to vote.
Shares Held in the Meridian 401(k) Plan: If you are a participant in the East Boston Savings Bank 401(k) Retirement Plan (which we refer to as the

allocated to his or her account. The East Boston ESOP trustee will vote all unallocated shares of Meridian common stock held by the East Boston
ESOP and allocated shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion as shares for which it has received timely voting
instructions, so long as such vote is solely in the interests of participants and beneficiaries and in accordance with the requirements of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
 
Q.
Can I attend the Meridian special meeting and vote my shares in person?
 
A.
Yes. All holders of common stock of Meridian, including holders of record and holders who hold their shares through banks, brokers or any other
holder of record, are invited to attend the Meridian special meeting. Holders of record of Meridian common stock can vote in person at the Meridian
special meeting. If you are not a holder or record (i.e., if your shares are held for you in “street name”), you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in
your favor, from the record holder of your shares, such as a broker, bank, or other holder of record to be able to vote in person at the Meridian
special meeting. If you plan to attend the meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or have a letter from the record holder of your
shares confirming your ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of personal photo identification with you in order to be admitted to the
meeting. Meridian reserves the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of share ownership or without proper photo
identification. Whether or not you intend to be present at the Meridian special meeting, you are urged to sign, date and return your proxy card, or
to vote via the Internet or by telehone promptly. If you are then present and wish to vote your shares in person, your original proxy may be revoked
by voting by ballot at the Meridian special meeting.

May a Meridian stockholder change its vote after submitting a proxy?
 
A.
Yes. A Meridian stockholder may change a vote at any time before the Meridian stockholder’s proxy is voted at the Meridian special meeting. A
proxy may be revoked by executing and timely submitting a later-dated proxy card, or by attending the Meridian special meeting and voting in
person. A Meridian stockholder executing a Meridian proxy card may also revoke the proxy at any time before it is voted by giving written notice
revoking the proxy to Meridian’s Corporate Secretary, by timely filing another Meridian proxy card bearing a later date or by attending the Meridian
special meeting and voting in person. Attending the Meridian special meeting will not automatically revoke a Meridian stockholder’s prior

Each share of Meridian common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, except for certain shares owned by
Independent or Meridian, will be converted into the right to receive 0.275 of a share of Independent common stock. Meridian stockholders who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Independent common stock in the merger will instead receive, for the fraction of a share, an
amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) based on the volume-weighted average trading price per share of Independent common stock for the
five consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the closing date.
Independent common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “INDB,” and Meridian common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the
symbol “EBSB.” The following table shows the closing sale prices of Independent common stock and Meridian common stock as reported on the

Stock Options. Each stock option, whether vested or unvested, will fully vest and be cancelled at the effective time of the merger. On
the closing date of the merger, East Boston or Meridian will pay to the holders of such stock options cash in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Meridian common stock provided for in each such stock option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of (x) the per share cash equivalent consideration (as defined below) over (y) the exercise price. Any stock option for which the
exercise price per share of Meridian common stock provided for in such stock option exceeds the per share cash equivalent
consideration will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger without payment. The cash payment will be paid within five business
days after the closing date of the merger, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of the merger agreement,
“per share cash equivalent consideration” means the product (rounded to the nearest cent) obtained by multiplying (i) the exchange
ratio by (ii) the volume-weighted average trading price of a share of the Independent common stock on Nasdaq for the consecutive
period of five full trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the closing date.
Restricted Stock Awards. Each share of restricted stock will fully vest at the effective time of the merger and be considered an
outstanding share of Meridian common stock entitled to receive the merger consideration. The merger consideration will be issued
within five business days after the closing date of the merger, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.

and has unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the

In connection with the merger, Independent’s financial advisor, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., which is referred to in this document as KBW,
delivered a written opinion, dated April 22, 2021, to the Independent board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the
date of the opinion, to Independent of the exchange ratio in the proposed merger. The full text of the opinion, which describes the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion, is
attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the Independent board of
directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinion did not address the
underlying business decision of Independent to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the
Independent board of directors in connection with the merger, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Independent common
stock or any shareholder or stockholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter.

The Independent special meeting will be held at the Doubletree by Hilton Boston, 929 Hingham Street, Rockland, Massachusetts 02370 on August 5,
2021 at 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time. At the Independent special meeting, Independent shareholders will be asked to vote on the following matters:
 
 
•
 the Independent share issuance proposal; and
 
 
•
 the Independent adjournment proposal.
You may vote at the Independent special meeting if you owned shares of Independent common stock at the close of business on June 17, 2021. As
of June 17, 2021, there were 33,038,752 shares of Independent

their affiliates. We currently expect that Independent’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the Independent share
issuance proposal, although none of them has entered into any agreements obligating them to do so.
The Independent share issuance proposal and the Independent adjournment proposal will each be approved if a majority of the votes cast at the
Independent special meeting are voted in favor of such proposal. If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or vote at the
Independent special meeting or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the Independent share issuance proposal or the

Independent and Meridian expect the merger to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, neither Independent nor Meridian can predict the
actual date on which the merger will be completed, or if the merger will be completed at all, because completion is subject to conditions and factors
outside the control of both companies. Independent and Meridian must first obtain the approval of Independent shareholders and Meridian
stockholders for the merger, as well as obtain necessary regulatory approvals and satisfy certain other closing conditions.

Independent and Meridian may mutually agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger, even if Meridian
stockholders have approved the merger. Also the merger agreement can be terminated in the following circumstances:
 
 
•
 by either Independent or Meridian if its board of directors determines by a majority vote that any governmental entity that must grant a
requisite regulatory approval has denied approval of the merger, the holdco merger or the bank merger and such denial has become final
and nonappealable or any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction, decree
or other legal restraint or prohibition permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the merger, the holdco merger or
the bank merger, unless the failure to obtain a requisite regulatory approval is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the
merger agreement to perform or observe its obligations, covenants and agreements under the merger agreement;
 
 
•
 by either Independent or Meridian if the merger has not been completed on or before April 22, 2022 (the “end date”), unless the failure
of the merger to be completed by such date is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or
observe its obligations, covenants and agreements under the merger agreement;

obligation, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement) if there is a breach of any of the obligations, covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty ceases to be true) set forth in the
merger agreement on the part of Meridian, in the case of a termination by Independent, or Independent or Merger Sub, in the case of a
termination by Meridian, which either individually or in the aggregate would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the date the
merger is completed, the failure of a closing condition of the terminating party and which is not cured within 30 days following written
notice to the party committing such breach, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain

The merger and the holdco merger, taken together, are intended to qualify, and the obligations of the parties to complete the merger are conditioned
upon the receipt of a legal opinion from their respective counsel to the effect that the merger and the holdco merger, taken together, will qualify, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Meridian’s stockholders generally will not recognize gain or loss with respect to the
Independent common stock that they receive in the merger, except with respect to any cash they receive in lieu of receiving a fractional share of
Independent common stock.
This tax treatment may not apply to all of Meridian’s stockholders. Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger
to Meridian stockholders can be complicated and will depend upon their particular circumstances. Meridian’s stockholders should consult their
own tax advisors for a full understanding of the mergers’ tax consequences that are particular to each Meridian stockholder.

When the merger is completed, Meridian stockholders will receive Independent common stock as consideration in the merger and become
Independent shareholders. The rights of Independent shareholders differ from the rights of Meridian stockholders in important ways. Many of these
differences relate to provisions in Independent’s articles of organization and bylaws that differ from those of Meridian. See “Comparison of Rights
of Shareholders of Independent and Stockholders of Meridian” beginning on page 127 for a summary of the material differences between the
respective rights of Meridian and Independent stockholders.

Dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a

receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Dissenters’ rights are not available in all
circumstances, and exceptions to these rights are provided under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as

Litigation Related to the Merger (see page 99)
On June 9, 2021, a complaint, captioned Shiva Stein v. Meridian Bancorp, Inc. et al., No. 1:21-cv-05116-MKV, was filed by a purported stockholder
of Meridian in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint names Meridian and the Meridian board of directors. The
complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants caused a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement relating to the
proposed merger to be filed with the SEC in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder.
The complaint seeks, among other relief, an injunction preventing the closing of the merger unless and until defendants disclose the allegedly
omitted material information, rescission of the merger to the extent already implemented or awarding of rescissory damages, damages and an award
of attorneys’ and experts’ fees. Meridian believes the claims asserted in the complaint are without merit.

In addition to the other information included in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” Meridian’s stockholders and Independent’s shareholders should carefully consider the following risks
before deciding whether to vote for approval of the merger agreement. In addition, stockholders of Meridian should read and consider the risks
associated with the business of Independent because these risks will relate to the combined company. Certain of these risks with respect to the business
of Independent can be found in Independent’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and quarterly report on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, which reports are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You should also

"Meridian Bancorp, Inc._20210622_DEFM14A_19361639_4244116.Pdf",Risks Related to the Merger,"Risks Related to the Merger
Because the market price of Independent common stock will fluctuate, Meridian stockholders cannot be sure of the trading price of the stock portion
of the merger consideration they will receive.
In the merger, each share of Meridian common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, except for certain shares owned by
Independent or Meridian, will be converted into the right to receive 0.275 of a share of Independent common stock. This exchange ratio is fixed and will
not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Independent common stock or Meridian common stock. Changes in the price of Independent
common stock between now and the time of the merger will affect the value that Meridian stockholders will receive in the merger. Neither Independent nor
Meridian is permitted to terminate the merger agreement as a result of any increase or decrease in the market price of Independent common stock or
Meridian common stock.
Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Meridian’s and Independent’s
businesses, operations and prospects, the recent volatility in the prices of securities in global financial markets, including market prices of Meridian,
Independent and other banking companies, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and regulatory considerations, many of which are beyond Meridian’s
and Independent’s control. Therefore, at the time of the Independent special meeting and the Meridian special meeting, Independent shareholders and
Meridian stockholders will not know the market value of the consideration that Meridian stockholders will receive at the effective time. You should obtain
current market quotations for shares of Independent common stock and for shares of Meridian common stock.
The market price of Independent common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the shares of
Meridian common stock or Independent common stock.
In the merger, Meridian stockholders will become Independent shareholders. Independent’s business differs from that of Meridian. Accordingly, the
results of operations of Independent and the market price of Independent common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors
different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Independent and Meridian. For a discussion of the businesses of
Independent and Meridian and of certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 142.

and prospects of Meridian or Independent, changes in general market and economic conditions or other changes. Any of these changes may alter the
relative value of Meridian or Independent or the prices of shares of Meridian common stock or Independent common stock by the time the merger is
completed. The opinions do not speak as of the date the merger will be completed or as of any date other than the dates of the respective opinions. For a
description of the opinion of Meridian’s financial advisor, please see “The Merger—Opinion of Meridian’s Financial Advisor.” For a description of the
opinion of Independent’s financial advisor, please see “The Merger—Opinion of Independent’s Financial Advisor.”
Meridian will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.
Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Meridian and, consequently, on Independent.
These uncertainties may impair Meridian’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated, and could cause
customers and others that deal with Meridian to seek to change existing business relationships with Meridian. Retention of certain employees may be
challenging during the pendency of the merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Independent. If key
employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty or difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Independent, Independent’s
business following the merger could be harmed. In addition, the merger agreement restricts Meridian from taking certain actions without the consent of
Independent until the merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent Meridian from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the
completion of the merger. Please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement – Conduct of Business Pending the Merger” of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for a description of the restrictive covenants to which Meridian is subject.
Independent may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger, particularly if the integration of Independent’s and Meridian’s
businesses is more difficult than expected.
The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of Independent and Meridian. Independent may fail
to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected. Furthermore, any
number of unanticipated adverse occurrences for either the business of Meridian or Independent may cause us to fail to realize some or all of the
expected benefits. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers,
depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Each of these issues might adversely affect Independent, Meridian or both
during the transition period, resulting in adverse effects on Independent following the merger. As a result, revenues may be lower than expected or costs
may be higher than expected and the overall benefits of the merger may not be as great as anticipated.
Some of the directors and executive officers of Meridian may have interests and arrangements that may have influenced their decisions to support
and recommend that you approve the merger.
The interests of some of the directors and executive officers of Meridian may be different from those of Meridian stockholders, and certain directors and
executive officers of Meridian may be participants in arrangements that are different from, or are in addition to, those of Meridian stockholders, including
agreements in settlement of obligations to such officers under a pre-existing employment agreement and change in control agreements,
 
28
Table of Contents
employment or consulting agreements with Rockland Trust, service on a post-closing transition advisory board and provisions in the merger agreement
relating to indemnification of directors and officers and insurance for directors and officers of Meridian for events occurring before the merger. These
interests are described in more detail in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger—Interests of Meridian’s Executive
Officers and Directors in the Merger” beginning on page 88.
The COVID-19 pandemic may delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the
business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of Independent and Meridian. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cause a
continued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of Independent or Meridian, or the business operations of
Independent or Meridian are further disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to complete the merger and integrate the businesses of
Independent and Meridian may also be delayed and adversely affected. Additional time may be required to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, and
the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Massachusetts Division of Banks and/or other regulators may impose additional requirements on Independent
or Meridian that must be satisfied prior to completion of the merger, which could delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger.
Independent may be unable to retain Independent and/or Meridian personnel successfully after the merger is completed.
The success of the merger will depend in part on Independent’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by
Independent and Meridian. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with Independent or Meridian, as applicable, while the merger is
pending or with Independent after the merger is completed. If Independent and Meridian are unable to retain key employees, including management, who
are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, Independent and Meridian could face disruptions in their operations,
loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, following the
merger, if key employees terminate their employment, Independent’s business activities may be adversely affected, and management’s attention may be
diverted from successfully integrating Independent and Meridian to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause Independent’s business to
suffer. In addition, Independent and Meridian may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary and the actual
purchase price as well as the actual financial condition and results of operations of Independent after the merger may differ materially.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes only
and is not necessarily indicative of what Independent’s actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the merger been
completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflects adjustments, which are based upon
preliminary estimates, to record the Meridian identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The
purchase price allocation reflected in this document is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price
and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Meridian as of the date of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the actual purchase price may vary
significantly from the purchase price used in preparing the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial information in this document.
Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document. For more
information, see “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” beginning on page 34.

Independent and Meridian are expected to incur significant costs related to the merger and integration.
Independent and Meridian have incurred and expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and
closing the merger. In addition, Independent will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as Independent integrates the Meridian
business, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs.
There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these
transaction and integration costs over time. Independent and Meridian may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key
employees. Independent and Meridian will also incur significant legal, financial advisory, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to
regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger. Some of these costs are payable
regardless of whether the merger is completed. See “The Merger Agreement—Fees and Expenses” beginning on page 118.
The merger agreement limits Meridian’s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger.
The merger agreement contains provisions that limit Meridian’s ability to solicit, initiate, encourage or take any actions to facilitate competing third- party
proposals to acquire all or substantially all of Meridian. These provisions, which include a $44,145,000 termination fee, payable under certain
circumstances, might discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or substantially all of Meridian from
considering or proposing that acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share market price than that proposed in the
merger, or might result in a potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire Meridian than it might otherwise have
proposed to pay.
Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer to receive than expected or may impose burdensome conditions that are not presently
anticipated.
Before the merger may be completed, certain approvals or consents must be obtained from the various bank regulatory and other authorities of the United
States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These governmental entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Massachusetts
Division of Banks, may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. While Independent and
Meridian do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such
conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of Independent
following the merger, any of which might have a material adverse effect on Independent following the merger. Independent is not obligated to complete
the merger if the regulatory approvals received in connection with the completion of the merger include any conditions or restrictions that would
constitute a “Burdensome Condition” as defined in the merger agreement.
There can be no assurance as to whether the regulatory approvals will be received or the timing of the approvals. For more information, see the section
entitled “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Merger” of this joint proxy statement/prospectus beginning on page 96.
If the merger is not consummated by April 22, 2022, either Independent or Meridian may choose not to proceed with the merger.
Either Independent or Meridian may terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not been completed by April 22, 2022, unless the failure of the
merger to be completed has resulted from the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform its obligations.

The shares of Independent common stock to be received by Meridian stockholders as a result of the merger will have different rights from the shares
of Meridian common stock.
The rights associated with Meridian common stock are different from the rights associated with Independent common stock. See the section of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Comparison of Rights of Shareholders of Independent and Stockholders of Meridian” beginning on page 127 for a
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Comparison of Rights of Shareholders of Independent and Stockholders of Meridian” beginning on page 127 for a
discussion of the different rights associated with Independent common stock.
Stockholders of Meridian will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management.
As a result of the merger, the percentage ownership of every Meridian stockholder in the combined company will be smaller than the Meridian
stockholder’s percentage ownership of Meridian prior to the merger. Independent estimates that upon completion of the merger, current Meridian
stockholders will own approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of Independent common stock, and current Independent shareholders will own
approximately 70% of the outstanding shares of Independent common stock.
Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the future business and financial results of Meridian.
If the merger is not completed, the ongoing business of Meridian may be adversely affected and Meridian will be subject to several risks, including the
following:
 
 
•
 Meridian may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Independent a termination fee of $44,145,000 under the merger agreement;
 
 
•
 Meridian will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal, accounting,
financial advisor and printing fees;
 
 
•
 under the merger agreement, Meridian is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completion of the merger,
which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies; and
 
 
•
 matters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by Meridian’s management, which could
otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Meridian as an independent company.
In addition, if the merger is not completed, Meridian may experience negative reactions from its customers and employees. Meridian also could be subject
to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Meridian to perform its obligations under the
merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, Meridian cannot assure its stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not
materially affect the business and financial results of Meridian.
Meridian stockholders will not have dissenters’ rights in the merger.
Dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and
to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration
offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, a stockholder may not dissent
from a merger as to shares that are listed on a national securities exchange at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice
of the meeting of stockholders to vote upon the agreement of merger or consolidation.
Because Meridian common stock is listed on NASDAQ, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to be so listed on the record date, and
because the merger otherwise satisfies the foregoing requirements
 
31
Table of Contents
of the Maryland General Corporation Law, holders of Meridian common stock will not be entitled to dissenters’ rights in the merger with respect to their
shares of Meridian common stock.
Independent will be able to issue additional shares of its common stock in the future, which may adversely affect the market price of Independent
common stock and dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.
In the future, Independent may issue additional shares of Independent common stock in connection with another acquisition, to increase its capital
resources or if Independent’s or Rockland Trust’s capital ratios fall below or near the Basel III regulatory required minimums. Additional common stock
offerings may dilute the holdings of Independent’s existing shareholders or reduce the market price of Independent common stock, or both. Independent
may also issue shares of Independent preferred stock, which may be viewed as having adverse effects upon the holders of common stock.
Litigation related to the merger has been filed against Meridian, the Meridian board of directors and Independent, and additional litigation may be
filed against Meridian and the Meridian board of directors and/or Independent and the Independent board of directors, which could prevent or
delay the completion of the merger or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of Independent and Meridian.
Litigation related to the merger has been filed against Meridian, the Meridian board of directors and Independent, and it is possible that additional
litigation by stockholders of Meridian and/or shareholders of Independent may be filed against Meridian and the Meridian board of directors and/or
Independent and the Independent board of directors in the future. One of the conditions to the closing is that no order, injunction or decree issued by
any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint preventing the consummation of the merger, the holdco merger, the
bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be in effect. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction
prohibiting Independent or Meridian defendants from completing the merger, the holdco merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in significant costs to
Independent and/or Meridian, including any cost associated with the indemnification of directors and officers of each company. Independent and
Meridian may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of the shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. Such litigation
could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Independent and Meridian and could prevent or delay the completion
of the merger.
The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on Independent’s business and operations following the completion of the merger is uncertain.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of
Independent following the completion of the merger will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including
the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employees, clients, counterparties and
service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Independent’s
business, and there is no guarantee that efforts by Independent to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective.
Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, Independent may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic’s global economic impact, including reduced availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and the negative financial effects from any
recession or depression that may occur.

condensed combined financial statements combines the historical consolidated financial position and results of operations of Independent and its
subsidiaries and Meridian and its subsidiaries, as an acquisition by Independent of Meridian using the acquisition method of accounting and giving
effect to the related pro forma adjustments described in the accompanying notes. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of

preliminary acquisition accounting adjustments. Actual adjustments will be made as of the effective date of the merger and, therefore, may differ from
those reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.

purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the financial results of the combined company had the companies actually been combined at the beginning
of each period presented. The adjustments included in these unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements are preliminary and may be revised.
This information also does not reflect the benefits of the expected cost savings and expense efficiencies, opportunities to earn additional revenue,
potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or asset dispositions, among other factors, and includes various preliminary estimates and
may not necessarily be indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have occurred if the merger had been consummated on the
date or at the beginning of the period indicated or which may be attained in the future. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated
financial statements has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes
of Independent, which have been separately filed by Independent with the SEC and are incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and Meridian, which have been separately filed by Meridian with the SEC and are incorporated by reference in this joint proxy

Notes to Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
1.
Estimated merger costs of $50.4 million (net of $13.7 million of taxes) are excluded from the pro forma financial statements. It is expected that these
costs will be recognized over time. These cost estimates for both Independent and Meridian are forward-looking. The type and amount of actual
costs incurred could vary materially from these estimates if future developments differ from the underlying assumptions used by management in
determining the current estimate of these costs. The current estimates of the merger costs, primarily comprised of anticipated cash charges, are as
follows:
 
Change in control contract and severance contracts

allocation of Meridian’s employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) are excluded from the pro forma financial statements. The estimated expenses will
be recognized, with an equal offsetting benefit to unearned compensation and additional paid in capital within equity. The tax benefit of this
expense is estimated to be approximately $2.8 million and is reflected in the balance sheet as increase to capital and other assets accordingly.

Unaudited Comparative Per Share Data
The table that follows presents, for both Independent and Meridian, historical information with respect to earnings, dividends and book value on a per
share basis. The table also presents preliminary pro forma information for both companies on a per share basis.
The unaudited pro forma combined per share data set forth below gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020, the beginning of the
earliest period presented, in the case of continuing net income per share data, and as of March 31, 2021, in the case of book value per share data,
assuming that each outstanding share of Meridian common stock had been converted into shares of Independent common stock based on the exchange
ratio of 0.275 shares of Independent common stock for each share of Meridian common stock. The unaudited pro forma combined per share data has been
derived from the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for each of Independent and Meridian as of and for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and the audited consolidated financial statements for each of Independent and Meridian as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The preliminary pro forma equivalent per share information shown for Meridian in the following table was obtained by multiplying the pro forma per share
amounts shown for Independent by the exchange ratio of 0.275. The actual number of shares to be issued by Independent in the merger will also depend
on the number of shares of Meridian common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger.
The preliminary pro forma financial information includes estimated adjustments to record Meridian’s assets and liabilities at their respective fair values
based on Independent’s management’s best estimate using the information available at this time. The preliminary pro forma adjustments may be revised
as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after
the merger is completed and after the completion of a final analysis to determine
 
42
Table of Contents
the fair values of Meridian’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the closing date. The final purchase price adjustments may
differ materially from the preliminary pro forma adjustments. Increases or decreases in the fair value of certain balance sheet amounts and other items of
Meridian as compared to the information presented in this document may change the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill and other assets
and liabilities and may impact the statement of income due to adjustments in yield and/or amortization of adjusted assets and liabilities.
It is anticipated that the merger will provide Independent with financial benefits, such as possible expense efficiencies and revenue enhancements, among
other factors, although no assurances can be given that these benefits will actually be achieved. The impact of these benefits has not been reflected in
the preliminary pro forma financial information. As required, the preliminary pro forma financial information includes adjustments that give effect to
events that are directly attributable to the merger and factually supportable. As a result, any planned adjustments affecting the balance sheet, income
statement, or shares of common stock outstanding subsequent to the assumed completion date of the merger have not been included.
The preliminary pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial results of the
combined companies had the merger actually been completed as of or at the beginning of each period presented nor does it indicate future results for any
interim or full-year period.
The information in the following table is derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto for Independent contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated into this document by reference.

Meridian stockholders are entitled to vote if the records of Meridian show that they held shares of Meridian common stock as of the close of business on
June 17, 2021. Beneficial owners of shares held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee (“street name”) should instruct their record holder how to
vote their shares. As of the close of business on the record date, 52,584,413 shares of Meridian common stock were outstanding. Each share of Meridian
common stock has one vote on each matter presented to Meridian stockholders. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Meridian common stock held in
“street name” and you want to vote your shares in person at the Meridian special meeting, you will have to get a written proxy in your name from the
broker, bank or other nominee who holds your shares.
Quorum",55,55
"Meridian Bancorp, Inc._20210622_DEFM14A_19361639_4244116.Pdf",Quorum,"Quorum
Meridian will have a quorum and will be able to conduct the business of the Meridian special meeting only if a majority of the shares of Meridian common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote is represented in person or by proxy at the Meridian special meeting. If you return a valid proxy card or attend the
Meridian meeting in person, your shares will be counted for determining whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting. Broker non-votes
also will be counted for determining the existence of a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares of
Meridian common stock for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power
with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.

As required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K and Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Meridian is providing its
stockholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory, non-binding vote on the compensation that may become payable to its named executive officers in

Meridian’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger,” beginning on page 88 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the related table and
narratives.
Meridian believes that the information regarding compensation that may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the
completion of the merger is reasonable and demonstrates that Meridian’s executive compensation program was designed appropriately and structured to
ensure the retention of talented executives and a strong alignment with the long-term interests of Meridian’s stockholders. This vote is not intended to

but will instead pay cash (determined on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price per share of Independent common stock for the five
consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the closing date, rounded to the nearest whole cent as provided by
Bloomberg L.P.) for any fractional share a Meridian stockholder would otherwise receive after aggregating all of his or her shares (the exchange ratio and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares collectively, the “merger consideration”).
Independent shareholders are being asked to approve the Independent share issuance proposal and Meridian stockholders are being asked to approve
the merger agreement proposal. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 100 for additional and more detailed information
regarding the legal documents that govern the merger, including information about the conditions to the completion of the merger and the provisions for
terminating or amending the merger agreement.",67,67

Meridian’s predecessor mutual holding company converted from a mutual holding company structure in July 2014, which resulted in Meridian becoming
the publicly traded holding company for East Boston. Over the course of the following years, Meridian managed its capital through organic growth, stock
repurchases and cash dividends. Since the conversion, Meridian also has, from time to time, been presented with and reviewed opportunities to acquire
or bid upon other financial institutions, including its acquisition of Meetinghouse Bancorp, Inc., which was completed in 2017.
Over the past few years, the Meridian board of directors has had numerous discussions with its management, industry analysts, and consultants
regarding the future of the community banking industry, the appropriate size and scale of Meridian and the profitability targets that it should be
attempting to achieve. These discussions have included the topics of competition, disintermediation risk, product requirements, technology investments,
and prospective valuation risks in the future.
Additionally, Richard J. Gavegnano, President and Chief Executive Officer of Meridian, has had numerous conversations with the chief executive officers
and investment banker representatives of various regional financial institutions that expressed possible interest in merging with or acquiring Meridian. In
each conversation, discussions centered on obtaining an understanding of strategic and operational value of a combination, cultural alignment of the
organizations and roles of employees, management and the board of directors. Conversations were shared with the Meridian board of directors to build
awareness and an understanding of the relative differences among the institutions.

At a regular board meeting held January 28, 2020, representatives of Raymond James attended the meeting and participated in certain discussions
regarding the strategic direction of Meridian. Raymond James is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience advising
financial institutions generally, including with respect to mergers and acquisitions. The board of directors reviewed various items, including information
with respect to trends in the banking industry and for Massachusetts financial institutions, an overview of the mergers and acquisitions market, peer
institution performance and market share information and matters related to strategic planning.
The COVID-19 pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020. The Board of Directors and management spent the remainder of 2020 focusing on East
Boston’s operations, including the health and safety of employees and providing support to East Boston’s customers and local communities.
Mr. Gavegnano continued to have informal discussions with representatives of financial institutions about the banking industry generally, including
strategic initiatives, and, in some instances, mergers and acquisitions.
Independent’s board of directors and senior management regularly consider strategic direction and business objectives, including strategic growth
opportunities, as part of continuous efforts to enhance value for shareholders and other constituencies. These reviews have focused on, among other
things, prospects and developments in the financial services industry, regulatory environment, the economy generally and in Massachusetts specifically,
and the implications of developments for financial institutions generally and Independent. In addition, Independent has regularly evaluated, pursued and
completed acquisitions to further its strategic objectives. Independent’s senior management, including Christopher Oddleifson, its Chief Executive
Officer, periodically has informal discussions with senior management and investment banker representatives of other financial institutions, including
Mr. Gavegnano and Raymond James. Mr. Oddleifson updates Independent’s board of directors regarding those discussions regularly, and the
Independent board has authorized Mr. Oddleifson and senior management to pursue discussions with financial institutions who have been identified as
potential acquisition targets.
In early January, 2021, as part of customary marketing efforts, Raymond James representatives met with Independent representatives and discussed a
number of topics regarding the banking industry and the Massachusetts market, including the competitive landscape. During these conversations, and
consistent with informal discussions in prior years, Raymond James and Independent discussed, in a general and exploratory fashion, possible strategic
advantages of a potential future merger between Meridian and Independent. Following the meeting, Raymond James provided a summary of this
discussion to Mr. Gavegnano.
Representatives of Raymond James continued discussions with Mr. Gavegnano over the next few weeks. In addition, on January 14, 2021, Mr. Gavegnano
reviewed matters with respect to Independent with the executive committee of the Meridian board of directors. Following these discussions, on
January 21, 2021, a Raymond James representative left a message for Mr. Oddleifson regarding Meridian. On January 22, 2021, Mr. Oddleifson spoke to
the Raymond James representative who inquired as to Independent’s continued interest in a potential merger transaction with Meridian. Mr. Oddleifson
conveyed that Independent may be interested but had other ongoing potential projects that it was currently focused on. Mr. Oddleifson stated that he
would get back to Raymond James.
Over the next few days, senior management of Independent discussed the potential strategic and financial benefits of a potential acquisition of Meridian
and potential financial terms for such a transaction and determined to indicate a willingness to engage in preliminary exploratory discussions with
Meridian and its representatives.
Beginning on January 24, 2021 and continuing through February 2, 2021, Mr. Oddleifson and Independent senior management had numerous discussions
with Raymond James regarding a possible merger between Independent and Meridian, including possible pricing terms for a potential transaction. On
January 29, 2021, Independent proposed an initial range of exchange ratios of Independent common stock for each share of Meridian common stock of
0.2735 to 0.275, which implied a pricing range of between $20.91 and $21.03, based upon the closing
 
57
Table of Contents
price for Independent common stock on January 28, 2021. Mr. Oddleifson notified the Chair of Independent’s board of directors that these discussions
were occurring.
Raymond James reported the details of these discussions to Mr. Gavegnano, who then provided information regarding the discussions to the Meridian
board of directors. Representatives of Raymond James indicated to Independent that the proposed pricing range was inadequate and discussions were
discontinued on February 2, 2021 after Independent indicated it was unwilling to increase the proposed pricing range.
On February 23, 2021, KBW, Independent’s financial advisor, contacted Raymond James to discuss the possibility of resuming transaction discussions.
On February 24, 2021, KBW reported this discussion to Independent senior management and at the direction of Independent, KBW then contacted
Raymond James to indicate Independent’s continued interest in pursuing a merger transaction. Later that same day, Independent provided Meridian a
non-binding indication of interest, including a fixed exchange ratio of 0.275 shares of Independent common stock for each share of Meridian common
stock, representing an implied price of $24.21 per share based on the then-current market price for Independent common stock, as well as a request for
exclusive negotiating rights with Meridian through April 30, 2021.
On March 1, 2021, the Meridian board of directors held a special meeting to consider the proposal from Independent. The board discussed with special
legal counsel, Luse Gorman, PC (“Luse Gorman”), the board’s fiduciary duties in a merger transaction. Raymond James updated the Meridian board
regarding the merger market, and discussed the financial aspects of the proposal from Independent in comparison to recent transactions. Raymond James
also reviewed with the board the prices that could potentially be paid by other possible merger partners, based on Raymond James’ knowledge of the
merger market and these entities. The presentation and discussion also included information concerning other potential merger partners, their capacity to
engage in a strategic transaction with Meridian and pro forma analyses of the combination of Meridian and Independent. After reviewing the information
and consulting with Raymond James, Meridian’s board of directors authorized Mr. Gavegnano to enter into the indication of interest and the exclusivity
agreement requested by Independent, subject to requiring that the exclusivity be mutual.
On March 4, 2021, Independent and Meridian entered into the non-binding indication of interest, mutual exclusivity agreement, and a mutual
nondisclosure agreement. Commencing March 5, 2021 the parties began conducting detailed due diligence reviews of each other and members of each
organization’s executive management teams, along with the parties’ respective advisors, met several times as part of the parties’ diligence investigations
and to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction.
On March 18, 2021, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Independent board of directors, Independent senior management updated the board regarding
the potential transaction with Meridian, including the strategic and financial benefits of the proposed merger. Independent’s board expressed its support
for senior management to proceed with its due diligence review and negotiation of the proposed merger.
On April 1, 2021, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”), legal counsel to Independent, shared with Luse Gorman a first draft of the
proposed merger agreement. From April 1, 2021 through April 22, 2021, Independent and Meridian and their respective legal advisors negotiated the
proposed merger agreement and other ancillary documents and agreements.
On April 15, 2021, Raymond James reviewed with the Meridian board of directors at a special meeting the financial aspects of the proposed merger,
including in comparison to the potential future performance of Meridian as reviewed with Meridian’s management on a stand-alone basis. The board of
directors reviewed in detail with representatives of Luse Gorman and Raymond James the merger agreement and ancillary documents, including the
voting agreement to be entered into by Meridian’s directors and executive officers. The board was also presented with the due diligence findings of the
management team and Meridian’s legal and financial advisors and various pro forma analyses of the combined entity.

On April 20, 2021, Independent’s board of directors held a special meeting to discuss the proposed Meridian merger. The meeting was attended by senior
management and representatives of KBW and Wachtell Lipton. Prior to the meeting, the directors received a summary of the terms of the draft merger
agreement and ancillary agreements from Wachtell Lipton. Management began its presentation of due diligence findings of Meridian, with the remainder
to be completed at the board meeting scheduled for April 22, 2021, and legal counsel reviewed the board’s fiduciary duties and the proposed terms of the
merger agreement.
The parties finalized the negotiations of the merger agreement and ancillary agreements over the next two days, including the consulting agreements and
other employment arrangements for Mr. Gavegnano and certain other Meridian employees.
At a special meeting of Meridian’s board of directors held on April 22, 2021, the board of directors met to discuss the proposed merger and review the
final merger agreement and ancillary documents. At that meeting, representatives from Luse Gorman and Meridian management summarized the results of
Meridian’s due diligence investigation of Independent and Luse Gorman again discussed with the board the board’s fiduciary duties with respect to the
transaction. Raymond James also reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and rendered to the Meridian board of directors an opinion to
the effect that, as of April 22, 2021, and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on
the review undertaken by Raymond James, as set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of Meridian common stock. Legal counsel also discussed the proposed resolutions regarding the proposed merger that the independent
members of the board (all directors except for Messrs. Gavegnano and Merritt) would be requested to approve, as well as the proposed resolutions
regarding the proposed merger that the full board would be requested to approve. After further discussion, the independent members of Meridian’s board
of directors voted unanimously to approve the merger agreement with Independent in substantially the form presented and voted unanimously to
approve the executive compensation arrangements of senior officers, including Messrs. Gavegnano and Merritt. Following this vote, and taking into
consideration the factors described under “—Meridian’s Reasons for the Merger,” the board of directors voted unanimously to approve the merger
agreement in substantially the form presented, to recommend that Meridian stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement and the merger, and to
authorize management, with the assistance of counsel, to finalize and execute the merger agreement and all related documents.
On April 22, 2021, at a regularly scheduled meeting the Independent board of directors continued its review and consideration of the proposed Meridian
merger. Senior management updated the board of directors on the final negotiations and finished its presentation of the due diligence investigation of
Meridian. KBW also reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and rendered to the Independent board of directors its opinion (which was
initially rendered verbally and subsequently confirmed by delivery of KBW’s written opinion dated April 22, 2021) to the effect that, as of that date, and
subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW, as set
forth in its written opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Independent. Following further
discussion, during which the directors considered the matters reviewed and discussed at that meeting and all prior meetings, including the factors
described under “—Independent’s Reasons for the Merger,” the board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the share issuance, were advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Independent and
its shareholders, and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and recommended
that Independent shareholders vote to approve the share issuance in connection with the merger.
Thereafter, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement and ancillary documents. A joint press release announcing the approval, adoption,
and execution of the merger agreement was then issued on April 22, 2021 and Independent and Meridian each filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the
SEC.

national and local economic conditions, the interest rate environment, increasing operating costs resulting from regulatory initiatives,
compliance mandates and investments in technology, the competitive environment for financial institutions generally and the likely effect of
these factors on Meridian with and without the proposed transaction;
 
 
•
 conditions and activity in the mergers and acquisition market providing a unique window of opportunity with respect to a merger of
Meridian and delivering accelerated and enhanced stockholder value, as compared to through organic growth;

this type and with the strategic purpose of the transaction;

 under the terms of the merger agreement, the ability of the Meridian board of directors, in response to an unsolicited third-party proposal or
an intervening event, to change or withhold its recommendation to the Meridian stockholders if it concludes in good faith (after receiving

merger agreement, including, among others, the following:
 
 
•
 the fact that the integration of Meridian and Independent may be complex and time consuming and may require substantial resources and
effort;

During its consideration of the merger agreement, the Meridian board of directors also considered that certain Meridian officers and directors may have
financial interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Meridian stockholders. See “The Merger—Interests of
Meridian’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger,” beginning on page 88.
The discussion of the information and factors considered by the Meridian board of directors is not exhaustive, but includes all material factors
considered by the Meridian board of directors. Based on the factors described above, the Meridian board of directors determined that the merger with
Independent would be advisable and in the best interests of Meridian stockholders and approved the merger agreement and related transactions it
contemplates. In view of the wide variety and complexity of factors considered by the Meridian board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the
merger, the Meridian board of directors did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any
aspect of any factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Meridian board of directors. Rather, the Meridian board of directors
made its recommendation based on the totality of information presented to, and the investigation conducted by, it. In considering the factors discussed
above, individual directors may have given different weights to different individual factors.",71,73

recognized investment banking firm offering a full range of investment banking services to its clients. In the ordinary course of its investment banking
business, Raymond James is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions
and other corporate transactions. Pursuant to that engagement, the Meridian board of directors requested that Raymond James evaluate the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Meridian’s outstanding common stock (other than the Exception Shares) of the exchange ratio to be
received by such holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement.
At the April 22, 2021 meeting of the Meridian board of directors, representatives of Raymond James rendered its opinion, subsequently confirmed in

merger.
Raymond James provided its opinion for the information of the Meridian board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with, and for purposes
of, its consideration of the exchange ratio to be received by holders of Meridian’s outstanding common stock (other than the Exception Shares) in the
merger pursuant to the merger agreement and its opinion only addresses whether the exchange ratio in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Meridian common stock (other than the Exception Shares). The opinion of Raymond James does not

Meridian or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Raymond James, and Raymond James did not undertake any duty or responsibility to, nor did
Raymond James, independently verify any of such information. Furthermore, Raymond James undertook no independent analysis of any potential or
actual litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which Meridian or Independent was a party or may have

did not consider, the potential effects of any such litigation, claims or investigations or possible assertions. Raymond James did not make or obtain an
independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Meridian or Independent. With respect to the Projections, Pro Forma
Financial Adjustments, and any other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Raymond James, Raymond James,

in good faith on bases reflecting (or, in the case of the Projections with respect to 2021 and 2022, which were prepared using consensus analyst estimates
for the years 2021 and 2022, are consistent with) the best then-currently available estimates and judgments of management of Meridian, and Raymond
James relied upon Meridian to advise Raymond James promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be updated
during the period of its review. Raymond James expressed no opinion with respect to the Projections, the Pro Forma Financial Adjustments or the
assumptions on which they were based. Raymond James assumed that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially similar to the draft
reviewed by Raymond James, and that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver or
amendment of any conditions thereto. Furthermore, Raymond James assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations and
warranties of each party contained in the merger agreement were true and correct and that each such party would perform all of the covenants and
agreements required to be performed by it under the merger agreement without being waived. Raymond James relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification, that (i) the merger would be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable international, federal and
state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
merger would be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or conditions would be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that
would have an effect on the merger, Independent or Meridian that would be material to its analyses or opinion.
Raymond James expressed no opinion as to the underlying business decision to effect the merger, the structure or tax consequences of the merger, or the
availability or advisability of any alternatives to the merger. Raymond James provided advice to the Meridian board of directors with respect to the
proposed merger. Raymond James did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration or that any specific consideration constituted the
only appropriate consideration for the merger. Raymond James did not solicit indications of interest with respect to a transaction involving Meridian. The
opinion of Raymond James did not express any opinion as to the likely trading range of Independent common stock following the merger, which may vary
depending on numerous factors that generally impact the price of securities or on the financial condition of Independent at that time. The Raymond
James opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to be received by the holders of Meridian common stock
(other than the Exception Shares).
Raymond James expressed no opinion with respect to any other reasons, legal, business, or otherwise, that may support the decision of the Meridian
board of directors to approve or consummate the merger. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation was intended by Raymond James on matters
that require legal, accounting or tax advice. Raymond James assumed that such opinions, counsel or interpretations had been or would be obtained from
appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, Raymond James relied, with the consent of the Meridian board of directors, on the fact that Meridian was
assisted by legal, accounting and tax advisors, and, with the consent of the Meridian board of directors, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of the assessments by Meridian and its advisors, as to all legal, accounting and tax matters with respect to Meridian and the merger,
including, without limitation, that Meridian’s and Independent’s financial statements had been prepared in accordance with GAAP and that the merger
would qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Raymond James was not an
expert in the evaluation of allowances for loan and lease losses and had not independently verified such allowances or reviewed or examined any
individual loan or credit files. Raymond James assumed, with Meridian’s consent, that the allowance for loan and lease losses (i) set forth in the
respective financial statements of Meridian and Independent were adequate to cover such losses, (ii) would be adequate on a pro forma basis for the
combined entity and (iii) complied fully with applicable law, regulatory policy and sound banking practices as of the date of such financial statements.

In formulating its opinion, Raymond James considered only what it understood to be the exchange ratio to be received by the holders of Meridian
common stock (other than the Exception Shares), and Raymond James did not consider, and did not express an opinion on, the fairness of the amount or
nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of Meridian’s officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons, whether relative to the
compensation to be received by the holders of Meridian common stock (other than the Exception Shares) or otherwise. Raymond James was not
requested to opine as to, and its opinion did not express an opinion as to or otherwise address, among other things: (1) the fairness of the merger to the
holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Meridian, or to any other party, except and only to the extent expressly set forth in
the last sentence of its opinion or (2) the fairness of the merger to any one class or group of Meridian’s or any other party’s security holders or other
constituents vis-à-vis any other class or group of Meridian’s or such other party’s security holders or other constituents (including, without limitation,
the allocation of any consideration to be received in the merger amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other constituents).
Raymond James expressed no opinion as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of Meridian or Independent or the ability of Meridian or
Independent to pay their respective obligations when they come due.
Material Financial Analyses
The following summarizes the material financial analyses reviewed by Raymond James with the Meridian board of directors at its meeting on April 22,
2021, which material was considered by Raymond James in rendering its opinion. No company or transaction used in the analyses described below is
identical or directly comparable to Meridian, Independent or the contemplated merger.
Contribution Analysis. Raymond James analyzed the relative contribution of Meridian and Independent to certain financial and operating metrics for the
pro forma combined company resulting from the merger. The financial and operating metrics included: (i) market capitalization; (ii) total assets; (iii) gross
loans; (iv) non-interest bearing deposits; (v) core deposits; (vi) total deposits; (vii) tangible common equity; (viii) last twelve months net interest income;
(ix) last twelve months operating fee income; (x) last twelve months net income; (xi) consensus estimated 2021 net income; and (xii) consensus estimated
2022 net income. Forward net income estimates were based on median consensus estimates as shown by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The estimates
published by Wall Street research analysts were not prepared in connection with the merger or at the request of Raymond James and may or may not
prove to be accurate. The relative contribution analysis did not give effect to any synergies as a result of the merger. The results of this analysis are

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Raymond James performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Meridian and Independent based on the Projections.
Consistent with the periods included in the Projections, Raymond James used estimated calendar year 2026 as the final year for the analysis and applied
multiples, ranging from 12.0x to 14.0x for Meridian and 18.0x to 22.0x for Independent, to estimated calendar year 2026 earnings in order to derive a range
of estimated terminal values for Meridian and Independent in 2025.
For Independent, Raymond James used discount rates ranging from 10.1% to 12.1%. For Meridian, Raymond James used discount rates ranging from
10.5% to 12.5%. Raymond James arrived at its discount rate ranges by using the 2020 Duff & Phelps Valuation Handbook. Raymond James reviewed the
ranges of implied per share values indicated by the discounted cash flow analysis for each of Independent and Meridian and calculated a range of implied
exchange ratios by dividing the maximum implied per share value of Meridian common stock by the minimum implied per share value of Independent
common stock to calculate the maximum implied exchange ratio, and by dividing the minimum implied per share value of Meridian common stock by the
maximum implied per share value of Independent common stock to calculate the minimum implied exchange ratio. The results of the discounted cash flow
analysis are summarized in the table below:

Selected Companies Analysis. Raymond James reviewed certain data for selected companies with publicly traded equity securities that it deemed relevant
for its analysis. The selected group represents companies Raymond James believed to be relevant to each of Independent and Meridian. Raymond James
selected certain companies that: (i) are headquartered in New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont)
or the Mid-Atlantic (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania); (ii) have total assets between $8.0 billion and
$20.0 billion for Independent and between $3.0 billion and $10.0 billion for Meridian; (iii) have tangible common equity to tangible assets greater than
7.00%; (iv) have a most recent quarter return on average assets of greater than 1.00% for Independent and greater than 0.75% for Meridian; and (v) are
traded on the NASDAQ or NYSE. The aforementioned financial characteristics were shown for the bank subsidiary if consolidated data was unavailable,
and the financial characteristics were based on the most recent quarter period reported as of March 31, 2021, if available, otherwise for the quarter period
reported as of December 31, 2020. The selected groups exclude mutual holding companies and targets of announced mergers. The Meridian selected
group also excludes The Bancorp, Inc. due to its unique business model. No company used in the analysis described below is identical or directly
comparable to either Independent or Meridian. The selected companies Raymond James deemed relevant include the following:

Raymond James calculated various financial multiples for each selected public company, including price per share at close on April 21, 2021 compared to:
(i) basic tangible book value (“TBV”) per share at March 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020 as shown by S&P Global Market Intelligence; (ii) estimated 2021
earnings per share (“2021 EPS”) based on consensus estimates as shown by S&P Global Market Intelligence; and (iii) estimated 2022 earnings per share
(“2022 EPS”) based on consensus estimates as shown by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The estimates published by Wall Street research analysts were
not prepared in connection with the Merger or at the request of Raymond James and may not prove to be accurate. Raymond James reviewed the median
and the 100th percentile relative valuation multiples of the selected public companies for Independent and the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile
relative valuation multiples of the selected public companies for Meridian. The results of the selected companies’ analysis for each of Independent and

price to tangible book value per share ratio and earnings per share multiples to the corresponding financial data for Meridian. Raymond James reviewed
the ranges of implied per share values and calculated a range of implied exchange ratios by dividing the higher implied per share value of Meridian by the
lower implied per share value of Independent to calculate the implied exchange ratio, and by dividing the lower implied per share value of Meridian by the
higher implied per share value of Independent to calculate the low implied exchange ratio. The results of the selected companies’ analysis are summarized

Raymond James examined valuation multiples of transaction value compared to the target companies’(i) most recent quarter basic TBV per share as
shown by S&P Global Market Intelligence; (ii) premium to tangible book value divided by core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than
$100,000) (“Premium to Core Deposits”); (iii) last twelve months earnings per share (“LTM EPS”) as shown by S&P Global Market Intelligence;
(iv) current fiscal year earnings per share (“Current FY EPS”); and (v) next fiscal year earnings per share (“Next FY EPS”). Forward net income estimates
for the Current FY EPS and Next FY EPS multiples were based on mean consensus analyst estimates as shown by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The
estimates published by Wall Street research analysts and the companies involved in the selected transaction analysis were not prepared in connection
with the Merger or at the request of Raymond James and may or may not prove to be accurate. Raymond James applied the 25th percentile and 75th
percentile TBV multiple, Premium to Core Deposits multiple and earnings multiples to the corresponding Meridian metrics to create the range of exchange

Pro Forma Impact Analysis. For informational purposes only, Raymond James performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined projected
balance sheet and 2022 and 2023 estimated EPS information of Independent and Meridian. Using (i) closing balance sheet estimates as of December 31,
2021 for each of Independent and Meridian; (ii) financial forecasts and projections of each of Independent and Meridian for the year ending 2022 based
on consensus analyst estimates, which were authorized and reviewed by management of Meridian, and the year ending 2023, extrapolated based on
appropriate growth rates, which were authorized and reviewed by management of Meridian; and (iii) pro forma assumptions (including, without limitation,
the cost savings expected to result from the merger, as well as the purchase accounting adjustments), each of which were authorized and reviewed by
management of Meridian. Raymond James analyzed the estimated financial impact of the merger on certain projected financial results. This analysis
indicated that the merger could be accretive to Independent’s estimated tangible book value per share at December 31, 2021, and accretive to
Independent’s estimated 2022 and 2023 earnings per share. The analysis also indicated that the merger could be accretive to Meridian’s estimated 2022
dividend per share, as adjusted for the exchange ratio. For all of the above analyses, the actual results achieved by the pro forma company following the
merger may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.
Additional Considerations. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not susceptible to a partial analysis or summary
description. Raymond James believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without considering the
analyses taken as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In addition, Raymond James considered the results of
all such analyses and did not assign relative weights to any of the analyses, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of
each analysis and factor, so the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be the view of
Raymond James as to the actual value of Meridian.
 
69
Table of Contents
In performing its analyses, Raymond James made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic and
regulatory conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Meridian. The analyses performed by Raymond James are not
necessarily indicative of actual values, trading values or actual future results which might be achieved, all of which may be significantly more or less
favorable than suggested by such analyses. Such analyses were provided to the Meridian board of directors (in its capacity as such) and were prepared
solely as part of the analysis of Raymond James of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Meridian common stock of the exchange
ratio in the proposed merger pursuant to the merger agreement. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies
may actually be sold, and such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty. The opinion of Raymond James was one of many factors taken into
account by the Meridian board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger. Neither Raymond James’ opinion nor the analyses
described above should be viewed as determinative of the Meridian board of directors’ or Meridian management’s views with respect to Meridian,
Independent or the merger. Raymond James provided advice to Meridian with respect to the proposed merger. Raymond James did not, however,
recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Meridian board of directors or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the merger. Meridian placed no limits on the scope of the analysis performed, or opinion expressed, by Raymond James.
The Raymond James opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions existing and disclosed to it
as of April 21, 2021, and any material change in such circumstances and conditions may affect the opinion of Raymond James, but Raymond James does
not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm that opinion. As the Meridian board of directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets
had been experiencing unusual volatility and Raymond James expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on the merger,
Meridian, or Independent and the Raymond James opinion did not purport to address potential developments in any such markets. As the Meridian
board of directors was aware, there was significant uncertainty as to the potential direct and indirect business, financial, legal, economic and social
implications and consequences of the spread of the coronavirus and associated illnesses and the actions and measures that countries, governments,
regulatory agencies, central banks, international financing and funding organizations, stock markets, businesses and individuals may take to address the
spread of the coronavirus and associated illnesses including, without limitation, those actions and measures pertaining to fiscal or monetary policies,
legal and regulatory matters and the credit, financial and stock markets (collectively, the “Pandemic Effects”). Raymond James expressed no opinion or
view as to the potential impact of the Pandemic Effects on its analysis, its opinion, the merger, Meridian or Independent. Raymond James relied upon and
assumed, without independent verification, that, other than as had been disclosed to Raymond James, there had been no change in the business, assets,
liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of Meridian of Independent since the respective dates of the most recent
financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided to Raymond James that would be material to its analyses or its opinion, and
that there was no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by Raymond James incomplete or misleading in any material
respect.
For services rendered in connection with the delivery of its opinion, Meridian paid Raymond James a fee of $500,000 upon delivery of its opinion.
Meridian will also pay Raymond James a customary fee for advisory services in connection with the merger equal to approximately $12.2 million (less the
fee paid upon the delivery of the opinion), which is contingent upon the closing of the merger. Meridian also agreed to reimburse Raymond James for its
expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and expenses of its counsel, and will indemnify Raymond James against certain
liabilities arising out of its engagement.
Raymond James is actively involved in the investment banking business and regularly undertakes the valuation of investment securities in connection
with public offerings, private placements, business combinations and similar transactions. In the ordinary course of business, Raymond James may trade
in the securities of Meridian and Independent for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or
short position in such securities. In the two year period preceding the date of its opinion letter, Raymond James did not receive any fees from Meridian. In
the two year period preceding the date of its opinion

letter, Raymond James engaged in fixed income trading activity with Independent and/or certain of its affiliates, for which is had earned income.
Furthermore, Raymond James may provide investment banking, financial advisory and other financial services to Meridian and/or Independent or other
participants in the merger in the future, for which Raymond James may receive compensation.

opportunity to mitigate risks and increase potential returns;
 
 
•
 the compatibility of Independent’s and Meridian’s cultures, including their shared commitment to local communities, relationship-focused
banking;
 
 
•
 the anticipated pro forma financial impact of the merger on Independent, including potential tangible book value accretion, as well as

 the expectation of cost synergies resulting from the merger;
 
 
•
 the expectation that the merger will offer potentially significant revenue synergies across multiple business lines;
 
 
•
 its review and discussions with Independent’s senior management concerning Independent’s due diligence examination of, among other
areas, the operations, financial condition and compliance programs and prospects of Meridian;
 
 
•
 its review of the financial terms of the merger in consultation with Independent’s financial advisor and its review of the other terms of the
merger agreement, including the representations, covenants, deal protection and termination provisions in consultation with Independent’s
legal advisor;

 Independent’s past record of integrating acquisitions and of realizing expected financial and other benefits of such acquisitions and the
strength of Independent’s management and infrastructure to successfully complete the integration process.
The Independent board of directors also considered the potential risks related to the transaction. The board concluded that the anticipated benefits of
combining with Meridian were likely to outweigh these risks substantially. These potential risks included:
 
 
•
 the risk that, because the exchange ratio under the merger agreement would not be adjusted for changes in the market price of Independent
common stock or Meridian common stock, the implied market value of the shares of Independent common stock to be issued to Meridian
stockholders upon the completion of the merger could be significantly more than the implied market value of such shares immediately prior
to the announcement of the parties’ entry into the merger agreement;
 
 
•
 the risk that the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the mergers may not be received in a timely manner or at all or
may impose conditions that may adversely affect the anticipated operations, synergies and financial results of Independent following the
completion of the merger;
 
 
•
 the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will not be realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact
of, or difficulties arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy, general market conditions
and competitive factors in the areas where Independent and Meridian operate businesses;
 
 
•
 the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger and the integration of Meridian’s business into Independent and the
possibility that the transaction and the integration may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected
factors or events;
 
 
•
 the possibility of encountering difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings and synergies in the amounts currently estimated or within
the time frame currently contemplated;
 
 
•
 the possibility of encountering difficulties in successfully integrating the businesses, operations and workforces of Independent and
Meridian;
 
 
•
 the risk of losing key Independent or Meridian employees during the pendency of the merger and following the closing;
 
 
•
 the possible diversion of management focus and resources from the operation of Independent’s business while working to implement the
transaction and integrate the two companies;
 
 
•
 the potential for legal claims challenging the merger; and
 
 
•
 the other risks described under the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Independent board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes
the material factors considered by the board. Independent’s board of directors evaluated the factors described above, including by asking questions of
Independent’s management and Independent’s legal and financial advisors, and reached the unanimous decision that the merger agreement and
 
72
Table of Contents
the transactions contemplated thereby (including the mergers and the Independent share issuance) were advisable and fair to and in the best interests of
Independent and its shareholders. This discussion of the factors considered by Independent’s board of directors is not exhaustive. Independent’s board
of directors considered these factors as a whole, and overall considered them to be favorable to, and to support, its determination. Independent’s board
of directors did not consider it practical to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that it
considered in reaching its decision. In considering the factors described above, individual members of Independent’s board of directors may have given
different weights to different factors. Independent’s board of directors considered these factors as a whole, and overall considered them to be favorable
to, and to support, its determination.
In considering the recommendation of the Independent board of directors, you should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of
Independent may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, interests of Independent shareholders generally and may create
potential conflicts of interest.
It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Independent board of directors and all other information presented in this section is
forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” on page 25.

Independent engaged Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (“KBW”) to render financial advisory and investment banking services to Independent, including
an opinion to the Independent board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Independent of the exchange ratio in the proposed
merger. Independent selected KBW because KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar
to the transaction. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of financial services businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.
As part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the Independent board held on April 22, 2021 at which the Independent
board evaluated the proposed transaction. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and rendered an opinion to the
Independent board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in such opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to Independent. The Independent board approved the merger agreement at this meeting.
The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this
document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and
limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion.
KBW’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the Independent board (in its
capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the transaction. The opinion addressed only the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the exchange ratio in the merger to Independent. It did not address the underlying business decision of Independent to engage
in the transaction or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the Independent board in connection with the transaction, and
it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Independent common stock or any shareholder or stockholder of any other entity as to how to
vote in connection with the transaction or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not any such shareholder or
stockholder should enter into a voting, shareholders’, affiliates’ or other agreement with respect to the transaction or exercise any dissenters’ or
appraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder or stockholder.
 
73Table of Contents
KBW’s opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW’s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its policies and procedures established under the
requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
In connection with the opinion, KBW reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating condition of Independent and
Meridian and bearing upon the transaction, including, among other things:
 
 
•
 an execution version of the merger agreement, dated as of April 22, 2021;
 
 
•
 the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 of Independent;
 
 
•
 certain preliminary and unaudited quarterly financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of Independent (provided by
Independent);
 
 
•
 the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 of Meridian;
 
 
•
 certain preliminary and unaudited quarterly financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of Meridian (provided by Meridian);
 
 
•
 certain regulatory filings of Independent and Meridian and their respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly reports on Form FRY-9C and
quarterly call reports filed with respect to each quarter during the three year period ended December 31, 2020;
 
 
•
 certain other interim reports and other communications of Independent and Meridian to their respective shareholders or stockholders; and
 
 
•
 other financial information concerning the respective businesses and operations of Independent and Meridian furnished to KBW by
Independent and Meridian or which KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes of its analyses.
KBW’s consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to its analyses included,
among others, the following:
 
 
•
 the historical and current financial position and results of operations of Independent and Meridian;
 
 
•
 the assets and liabilities of Independent and Meridian;
 
 
•
 the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry;
 
 
•
 a comparison of certain financial and stock market information of Independent and Meridian with similar information for certain other
companies, the securities of which were publicly traded;
 
 
•
 publicly-available consensus “street estimates” of Independent and Meridian, as well as assumed Independent long-term growth rates and
financial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for periods beyond 2022 provided to KBW by Independent management, all
of which information was discussed with KBW by such management and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such
management and with the consent of the Independent board; and
 
 
•
 estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the transaction on Independent (including without limitation the cost savings,
related expenses and operating synergies expected to result or be derived from the transaction) that were prepared by, and provided to and
discussed with KBW by, Independent management, and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such management and with the
consent of the Independent board.
consent of the Independent board.
KBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its assessment of general economic, market and
financial conditions and its experience in other transactions, as well
 
74
Table of Contents
as its experience in securities valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated in discussions held by the managements
of Independent and Meridian regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of their
respective companies and such other matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry.
In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other
information that was provided to it or that was publicly available and KBW did not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of any such
information or assume any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. KBW relied upon Independent management as to the
reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Independent and Meridian, the assumed Independent long-
term growth rates, the financial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for periods beyond 2022, and the estimates regarding certain pro
forma financial effects of the transaction on Independent (including, without limitation, the cost savings, related expenses and operating synergies
expected to result or be derived from the transaction), all as referred to above (and the assumptions and bases for all such information), and KBW
assumed that all such information was reasonably prepared and represented, or in the case of the Independent and Meridian “street estimates” referred to
above that such estimates were consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of Independent management and that the forecasts,
projections and estimates reflected in such information would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated.
It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of Independent and Meridian that was provided to KBW was not prepared with
the expectation of public disclosure and that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of
Independent and Meridian referred to above, was based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain (including, without
limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions, and in particular, assumptions regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic)
and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. KBW assumed, based on discussions with the
management of Independent and with the consent of the Independent board, that all such information provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW
could form its opinion and KBW expressed no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. Among other things, such
information has assumed that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact, which has been assumed to be limited, on Independent
and Meridian. KBW relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and did not in any respect assume any responsibility or
liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.
KBW also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of either
Independent or Meridian since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made available to KBW. KBW is not an expert in the
independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and KBW assumed, without independent verification and with
Independent’s consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for Independent and Meridian are adequate to cover such losses. In
rendering its opinion, KBW did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of Independent or Meridian, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor did KBW
examine any individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of Independent or Meridian under any state or
federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be
appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty and
should not be taken as KBW’s view of the actual value of any companies or assets.
KBW assumed, in all respects material to its analyses:
 
 
•
 the transaction and any related transactions (including, without limitation, the bank merger) would be completed substantially in accordance
with the terms set forth in the merger agreement (the final terms of which KBW assumed would not differ in any respect material to its
analyses from the execution
 
75
Table of Contents
 
version of the merger agreement reviewed by KBW and referred to above), with no adjustments to the exchange ratio and with no other
consideration or payments in respect of Meridian common stock;
 
 
•
 the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in the
merger agreement were true and correct;
 
 
•
 each party to the merger agreement and all related documents would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed
by such party under such documents;
 
 
•
 there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental approval for the
transaction or any related transactions and all conditions to the completion of the transaction and any related transactions would be
satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the merger agreement or any of the related documents; and
 
 
•
 in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the transaction and any related
transactions, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, would
be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of Independent, Meridian or
the pro forma entity or the contemplated benefits of the transaction, including without limitation the cost savings, related expenses and
operating synergies expected to result or be derived from the transaction.
KBW assumed that the transaction would be consummated in a manner that complied with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. KBW was further
advised by representatives of Independent that Independent relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all
legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Independent, Meridian, the transaction and any related transaction and
the merger agreement. KBW did not provide advice with respect to any such matters.
KBW’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, of the exchange ratio in the merger to
Independent. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the transaction or any term or aspect of any related transaction
(including the bank merger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the transaction or any such related transaction, any consequences of
the transaction to Independent, its shareholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, consulting,
voting, support, shareholder, charitable giving or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the
transaction, any such related transaction, or otherwise. KBW’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated
on the date of such opinion and the information made available to KBW through such date. There has been widespread disruption, extraordinary
uncertainty and unusual volatility arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of evolving governmental interventions and
non-interventions. Developments subsequent to the date of KBW’s opinion may have affected, and may affect, the conclusion reached in KBW’s
opinion and KBW did not and does not have an obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. KBW’s opinion did not address, and KBW expressed
no view or opinion with respect to:
 
 
•
 the underlying business decision of Independent to engage in the transaction or enter into the merger agreement;
 
 
•
 the relative merits of the transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available to or contemplated by
Independent or the Independent board;
 
 
•
 any business, operational or other plans with respect to Meridian or the pro forma entity that may be contemplated by Independent or the
Independent board or that may be implemented by Independent or the Independent board subsequent to the closing of the transaction;
 
 
•
 the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of Independent’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such
persons, relative to any compensation to the holders of Independent common stock or relative to the exchange ratio;
 
76
Table of Contents
 
•
 the effect of the transaction or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class of
securities of Independent, Meridian or any other party to any transaction contemplated by the merger agreement;
 
 
•
 the actual value of Independent common stock to be issued in the merger;
 
 
•
 the prices, trading range or volume at which Independent common stock or Meridian common stock would trade following the public
announcement of the transaction or the prices, trading range or volume at which Independent common stock would trade following the
consummation of the merger;
 
 
•
 any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the transaction or any other transaction contemplated by the
merger agreement; or
 
 
•
 any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Independent, Meridian, any of their respective shareholders or
stockholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the transaction or any related transaction (including the bank merger),
including whether or not the transaction would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes.
In performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KBW, Independent and Meridian. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by
KBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these
analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses
or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the KBW
opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by the Independent board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and
the merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Independent board with respect to
the fairness of the exchange ratio. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined through negotiation between
Independent and Meridian and the decision of Independent to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Independent board.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by KBW to the Independent board in connection with its opinion. The summary
is not a complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the presentation made by KBW to the Independent board, but
summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex analytic process involving various determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In
arriving at its opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as
to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, KBW believes that its analyses and the summary of its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying
the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.
For purposes of the financial analyses described below, KBW utilized an implied transaction value for the proposed merger of $21.88 per outstanding
share of Meridian common stock, or $1,146.6 million in the aggregate (inclusive of the indicative value of in-the-money Meridian stock options), based on
the 0.275x exchange ratio in the proposed merger and the closing price of Independent common stock on April 21, 2021. In addition to the financial
analyses described below, KBW reviewed with the Independent board of directors for informational purposes, among other things, an implied transaction
multiple for the proposed merger (based on the implied transaction value for the merger of $21.88 per outstanding share of Meridian common stock) of
15.2x

Independent Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance, financial condition and
market performance of Independent to 13 selected major exchange-traded banks that are headquartered in the Mid-Atlantic region (defined as Delaware,
the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) and the Northeast region (defined as Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) with total assets between $8 billion and $16 billion. Merger targets and Puerto Rico banks were excluded from
the selected companies.
The selected companies were as follows:
 
Eastern Bankshares, Inc.
  
Eagle Bancorp, Inc.
Community Bank System, Inc.
  
NBT Bancorp, Inc.
Northwest Bancshares, Inc.
  
TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Provident Financial Services, Inc.
  
First Commonwealth Financial Corporation
Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.
  
S&T Bancorp, Inc.
Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc
  
Brookline Bancorp, Inc.
OceanFirst Financial Corp.
  
To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for the most recent completed fiscal quarter (“MRQ”) publicly reported
or as of the end of such period and market price information as of April 21, 2021. In the case of Independent, KBW also used profitability and other
financial information provided by Independent for the quarter ended or as of March 31, 2021. In addition, KBW used 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates taken
from publicly available consensus “street estimates” for Independent and the selected companies. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, and as
referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data presented in Independent’s historical financial statements, or the data prepared
by Raymond James & Associates, Inc. presented under the section “The Merger — Opinion of Meridian’s Financial Advisor,” as a result of the different
periods, assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute the financial data presented.

Unless otherwise indicated, based on Independent data for the period ended or as of March 31, 2021.
No company used as a comparison in the above selected companies analysis is identical to Independent. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not
mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
companies involved.
Meridian Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance, financial condition and market
performance of Independent to 11 selected major exchange-traded banks that are headquartered in the Northeast region with total assets between
$2 billion and $10 billion. Merger targets were excluded from the selected companies.
The selected companies were as follows:
 
Brookline Bancorp, Inc.
  
Bar Harbor Bankshares
Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc.
  
Hingham Institution for Savings
Camden National Corporation
  
Western New England Bancorp, Inc.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
  
The First Bancorp, Inc.
Enterprise Bancorp, Inc.
  
Bankwell Financial Group, Inc.
Cambridge Bancorp
  
To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for the latest 12 months (“LTM”) or the most recent completed fiscal
quarter (“MRQ”) publicly reported or as of the end of such periods and market price information as of April 21, 2021. In the case of Meridian, KBW also
used profitability and other financial information provided by Meridian for the quarter ended or as of March 31, 2021. In addition, KBW used 2021 and
2022 EPS estimates taken from consensus “street estimates” for Meridian and the selected
 
79

No company used as a comparison in the above selected companies analysis is identical to Meridian. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not
mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
companies involved.
Selected Transactions Analysis. KBW reviewed publicly available information related to eight selected U.S. whole bank transactions announced since
January 1, 2019 with announced transaction values between $500 million and $2 billion.
The selected transactions were as follows:
 
Acquiror
  
Acquired Company
Eastern Bankshares, Inc.
  Century Bancorp, Inc.
WSFS Financial Corporation
  Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation
SVB Financial Group
  Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc.
Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc.
  Opus Bank
FB Financial Corporation
  Franklin Financial Network, Inc.
United Bankshares, Inc.
  Carolina Financial Corporation
People’s United Financial, Inc.
  United Financial Bancorp, Inc.
Valley National Bancorp
  Oritani Financial Corp.
For each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based on the transaction consideration value paid
for the acquired company and using financial data based on the acquired company’s then latest publicly available financial statements prior to the
announcement of the respective transaction and, to the extent then publicly available, EPS consensus “street estimates” for the acquired company prior
to the announcement of the respective transaction:
 
 
•
 Price per common share to tangible book value per share of the acquired company;
 
 
•
 Price per common share to LTM EPS of the acquired company;
 
 
•
 Price per common share to the estimated EPS of the acquired company in the first full calendar year following the announcement of the
transaction (“forward EPS”) in the case of the seven selected transactions in which consensus “street estimates” for the acquired company
were then available; and
 
 
•
 Tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $250,000) of the acquired company, referred to as
core deposit premium.
KBW also reviewed the price per common share paid for the acquired company in the selected transactions as a premium to the closing price of the
acquired company one day prior to the announcement of the acquisition (expressed as a percentage and referred to as the one-day market premium). The
resulting transaction statistics for the selected transactions were compared with the corresponding transaction statistics for the proposed merger based
on the implied transaction value for the proposed merger of $21.88 per outstanding share of Meridian common stock and using historical financial
information for Independent as of or for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2021, the publicly available EPS consensus “street estimate” of Meridian
for 2022 and the closing price of Meridian common stock on April 21, 2021.
The results of the analysis are set forth in the following table (excluding the impact of the LTM EPS multiple for one of the selected transactions, which
multiple was considered to be not meaningful because it was greater than 30.0x):

No company or transaction used as a comparison in the above selected transaction analysis is identical to Meridian or the proposed merger. Accordingly,
an analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics of the companies involved.
Relative Contribution Analysis. KBW analyzed the relative standalone contribution of Independent and Meridian to various pro forma balance sheet
and income statement items and the combined market capitalization of the combined entity. This analysis did not include purchase accounting
adjustments or synergies. To perform this analysis, KBW used (i) balance sheet data for Independent and Meridian as of March 31, 2021, (ii) publicly
available consensus “street estimates” of Independent and Meridian, and (iii) market price information as of April 21, 2021. The results of KBW’s analysis
are set forth in the following table, which also compares the results of KBW’s analysis with the implied pro forma ownership percentages of Independent
and Meridian shareholders in the combined company based on the 0.275x exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement:

Forecasted Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis. KBW performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined projected income statement and
balance sheet information of Independent and Meridian. Using (i) closing balance sheet estimates as of December 31, 2021 for Independent and Meridian
taken from publicly available consensus “street estimates,” (ii) publicly available EPS consensus “street estimates” of Independent and Meridian,
(iii) assumed Independent long-term growth rates and financial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for 2023 provided by Independent
management, and (iv) pro forma assumptions (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from the merger and
certain purchase accounting and other merger-related adjustments and restructuring charges assumed with respect thereto) provided by Independent
management, KBW analyzed the potential financial impact of the transaction on certain projected financial results of Independent. This analysis indicated
the transaction could be accretive to Independent’s estimated 2022 EPS and estimated 2023 EPS and could be accretive to Independent’s estimated
tangible book value per share at closing as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, pro forma for the transaction, each of
Independent’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, and Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio at closing as of December 31, 2021
could be higher, and each of Independent’s Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Risk Based Capital Ratio at closing as of December 31, 2021 could be lower. For
all of the above analysis, the actual results achieved by Independent following the transaction may vary from the projected results, and the variations
may be material.
Independent Dividend Discount Model Analysis. KBW performed a dividend discount model analysis of Independent to estimate ranges for the implied
equity value of Independent. In this analysis, KBW used publicly available consensus “street estimates” for Independent and assumed long-term growth
rates for Independent provided by Independent, and KBW assumed discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0%. The ranges of values were derived by
adding (i) the present value of implied future excess capital available for dividends that Independent could generate over the period from March 31, 2021
to December 31, 2026 as a standalone company, and (ii) the present value of Independent’s implied terminal value at the end of such period. KBW
 
82
Table of Contents
assumed that Independent would maintain a tangible common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level.
KBW derived implied terminal values using two methodologies, one based on estimated 2027 earnings multiples and the other based on estimated
December 31, 2026 tangible book value multiples. In calculating the terminal value of Independent, KBW applied a range of 16.0x to 20.0x Independent’s
estimated 2027 earnings and a range of 1.90x to 2.30x Independent’s estimated December 31, 2026 tangible book value. This dividend discount model
analysis resulted in a range of implied values per share of Independent common stock of $67.07 per share to $84.35 per share based on estimated 2027
earnings multiples and a range of implied values per share of Independent common stock of $76.15 per share to $94.40 per share based on estimated
December 31, 2026 tangible book value multiples.
The dividend discount model analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent on the
assumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates. The foregoing dividend discount model
analysis did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of Independent or the pro forma combined company.
Meridian Dividend Discount Model Analysis. KBW performed a dividend discount model analysis of Meridian to estimate a range for the implied equity
value of Meridian, taking into account pro forma assumptions (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from
the merger and certain purchase accounting and other merger-related adjustments and restructuring charges assumed with respect thereto). In this
analysis, KBW used publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Meridian, financial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for
periods beyond 2022 provided by Independent management, and pro forma assumptions provided by Independent management, and KBW assumed
discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0%. The range of values was derived by adding (i) the present value of implied future excess capital available for
dividends that Meridian could generate over the period from March 31, 2021 to December 31, 2026 and (ii) the present value of Meridian’s implied terminal
value at the end of such period, in each case applying estimated cost savings and related expenses and other pro forma assumptions. KBW assumed that
Meridian would maintain a tangible common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. In calculating the
terminal value of Meridian, KBW applied a range of 12.0x to 14.0x Meridian’s estimated 2027 earnings (after applying estimated cost savings and related
expenses and other pro forma assumptions). This dividend discount model analysis resulted in a range of implied values per share of Meridian common
stock (taking into account pro forma assumptions) of $24.43 per share to $28.52 per share.
The dividend discount model analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent on the
assumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates. The foregoing dividend discount model
analysis did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of Meridian.
Miscellaneous. KBW acted as financial advisor to Independent in connection with the proposed merger and did not act as an advisor to or agent of any
other person. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in
connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, KBW has experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of banking
enterprises. Further to certain existing sales and trading relationships between Independent and each of KBW and a KBW broker-dealer affiliate, and
otherwise in the ordinary course of KBW and its affiliates’ broker-dealer businesses, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time purchase securities
from, and sell securities to, Independent and Meridian. In addition, as a market maker in securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a
long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of Independent or Meridian for its and their own respective accounts and for the
accounts of its and their respective customers and clients.
Pursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, Independent has agreed to pay KBW a total cash fee of $4,750,000, $750,000 of which became payable to
KBW with the rendering of KBW’s opinion and the balance of which is contingent upon the consummation of the transaction. Independent also has
agreed to reimburse KBW for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with its engagement and

to indemnify KBW against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of KBW’s engagement or KBW’s role in connection therewith. Other than the
present engagement, in the past two years preceding the date of the opinion, KBW did not provide investment banking or financial advisory services to
Independent. In the two years preceding the date of KBW’s opinion, KBW did not provide investment banking or financial advisory services to
Meridian. KBW may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Independent or Meridian and receive compensation for
such services.",84,95

Independent and Meridian do not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to their respective future performance,
revenues, earnings, financial condition or other results given, among other reasons, the inherent uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and
estimates, other than, from time to time, estimated ranges of certain expected financial results for the current year and certain future years in its earnings
investor presentations and other investor materials.
However, Independent and Meridian are including in this joint proxy statement/prospectus certain unaudited prospective financial information for
Independent and Meridian that was made available as described below. We refer to this information collectively as the “prospective financial
information.” A summary of certain significant elements of this information is set forth below and is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
solely for the purpose of providing Independent shareholders and Meridian stockholders access to certain nonpublic information made available to
Independent and Meridian and their respective boards of directors and financial advisors, as the case may be.
Neither Independent nor Meridian endorses the prospective financial information as necessarily predictive of actual future results. Furthermore, although
presented with numerical specificity, the prospective financial information reflects numerous estimates and assumptions made by Independent senior
management or Meridian senior management, as applicable, at the time such prospective financial information was prepared or approved for the financial
advisors to use. The prospective financial information represents Independent senior management’s or Meridian senior management’s respective
evaluation of Independent’s and Meridian’s expected future financial performance on a stand-alone basis, without reference to the merger (except as
expressly set forth below under “—Certain Estimated Synergies Attributable to the Merger”). In addition, since the prospective financial information
covers multiple years, such information by its nature becomes subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. These and the other estimates
and assumptions underlying the prospective financial information involve judgments with respect to, among other things, economic, competitive,
regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business,
economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and
economic conditions affecting the industries in which Independent and Meridian operate and the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors”
beginning on page 27 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page
25 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the reports that Independent and Meridian file with the SEC from time to time, all of which are difficult
to predict and many of which are outside the control of Independent and Meridian and will be beyond the control of Independent following the
completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that the underlying assumptions or projected results will be realized, and actual results could differ
materially from those reflected in the prospective financial information, whether or not the merger is completed. Further, these assumptions do not include
all potential actions that the senior management of Independent or Meridian could or might have taken during these time periods. The inclusion in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus of the prospective financial information below should not be regarded as an indication that Independent, Meridian or
their respective boards of directors or advisors considered, or now consider, this prospective financial information to be material information to any
Independent shareholders or Meridian stockholders, as the case may be, particularly in light of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such
prospective financial information, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and it should not be relied on as such. This information was
prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on
 
84Table of Contents
actual experience and business developments. The prospective financial information is not fact and should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of
actual future results. The prospective financial information also reflects numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time it was
prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date
it was prepared, including the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the possible financial and other effects on Independent or Meridian
of the merger, and does not attempt to predict or suggest actual future results of Independent following the completion of the merger or give effect to the
merger, including the effect of negotiating or executing the merger agreement, the costs that may be incurred in connection with consummating the
merger, the potential synergies that may be achieved by Independent as a result of the merger (except as expressly set forth below under “—Certain
Estimated Synergies Attributable to the Merger”), the effect on Independent or Meridian of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or
will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely
have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the
merger (in each case, except as expressly set forth below under “—Certain Estimated Synergies Attributable to the Merger”). Further, the prospective
financial information does not take into account the effect of any possible failure of the merger to occur. No assurances can be given that if the
prospective financial information and the underlying assumptions had been prepared as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, similar
assumptions would be used. In addition, the prospective financial information may not reflect the manner in which Independent would operate after the
merger.
The accompanying prospective financial information was not prepared for the purpose of, or with a view toward, public disclosure or with a view toward
complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial information, published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-looking statements or generally accepted accounting principles.
Neither Ernst & Young LLP (Independent’s independent registered public accounting firm), Wolf & Company, P.C. (Meridian’s independent registered
public accounting firm), nor any other independent registered public accounting firm, has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon
procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information and, accordingly, each of Ernst & Young LLP and Wolf & Company, P.C.
does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto or its achievability and assumes no responsibility for the prospective
financial information and disclaims any association with the prospective financial information. The reports by Ernst & Young LLP and Wolf & Company,
P.C. incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus relate to Independent’s and Meridian’s previously issued financial statements.
They do not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.

Certain Estimated Synergies Attributable to the Merger
Independent management developed and provided to its board of directors certain prospective financial information relating to the anticipated cost
synergies to be realized by Independent following the completion of the merger beginning in 2021. Such prospective financial information also was
(i) provided to Meridian, (ii) provided to Raymond James and approved by Meridian for Raymond James’ use and reliance as described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus under “—Opinion of Meridian’s Financial Advisor,” and (iii) provided to KBW and approved by Independent for KBW’s use and
reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under “—Opinion of Independent’s
Financial Advisor.”
The cost synergies consisted of fully phased-in estimated annual cost savings of approximately 45% of Meridian’s 2020 operating non-interest expense,
phased in approximately 80% in 2022 and 100% thereafter. The cost synergies assumed a hypothetical December 31, 2021 closing date for the merger.
See above in this section for further information regarding the uncertainties underlying the synergy estimates as well as the sections entitled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” beginning on pages 25 and 27, respectively, for further information regarding the
uncertainties and factors associated with realizing synergies in connection with the merger.
General
The stand-alone prospective financial information for Independent and Meridian was prepared separately using, in some cases, different assumptions,
and is not intended to be added together. Adding the financial forecasts together for the two companies is not intended to represent the results
Independent will achieve if the merger is completed and is not intended to represent forecasted financial information for Independent if the merger is
completed.
By including in this joint proxy statement/prospectus a summary of the prospective financial information, neither Independent or Meridian nor any of
their respective representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of Independent or Meridian
compared to the information contained in the prospective financial information. Neither Independent nor Meridian undertakes any obligation to update or
otherwise revise the prospective financial information to reflect circumstances existing since their preparation or to reflect the occurrence of subsequent
or unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be inappropriate, or to reflect changes in general
economic or industry conditions. None of Independent, Meridian or their respective advisors or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in
the future to make any representation to any Independent shareholders, Meridian stockholders or other person regarding Independent’s and Meridian’s
ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the prospective financial information or that the results reflected in the prospective
financial information will be achieved. The prospective financial information included above is provided because it was made available to and considered,
as the case may be, by Independent and Meridian, as the case may be, and their respective boards of directors and financial advisors in connection with
the merger.
In light of the foregoing, and considering that the Independent and Meridian special meetings will be held several months after the prospective financial
information was prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, Independent shareholders and Meridian stockholders are
cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on such information, and are urged to review Independent’s and Meridian’s most recent SEC filings for a
description of their reported financial results and the financial statements of Independent and Meridian incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 142. The prospective financial information
summarized in this section is not included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in order to induce any holder of Independent common stock to vote in
favor of the Independent share issuance proposal or any of the other proposals to be

In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Meridian, Meridian’s stockholders should be aware that Meridian’s directors and
executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Meridian stockholders generally. The
board of directors of Meridian was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, when it approved the merger agreement. These
interests, to the extent material, are described below.
Ownership of Meridian
The directors and executive officers of Meridian currently own Meridian common stock, some of whom have also been granted Meridian stock options
and restricted stock. As of June 1, 2021, such directors and executive officers beneficially owned an aggregate of 2,795,425 shares of Meridian common
stock, which total includes shares of Meridian common stock underlying Meridian stock options exercisable within 60 days of such date and restricted
shares of Meridian common stock that have vested or vest within 60 days of such date.
Treatment of Meridian Equity Awards
The executive officers and directors of Meridian and East Boston participate in Meridian’s equity-based compensation plans and hold outstanding stock
options and restricted stock granted under the plans.    
The merger agreement provides that Meridian equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be treated as follows:
Stock Options. Each stock option, whether vested or unvested, will fully vest and be cancelled at the effective time of the merger. On the closing date of
the merger, East Boston or Meridian will pay to the holders of such stock options cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Meridian common stock provided for in each such stock option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the per share cash equivalent consideration (as
defined below) over (y) the exercise price. Any stock option for which the exercise price per share of Meridian common stock provided for in such stock
option exceeds the per share cash equivalent consideration will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger without payment. The cash payment will
be paid within five business days after the closing date of the merger, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of the merger
agreement, “per share cash equivalent consideration” means the product (rounded to the nearest cent) obtained by multiplying (i) the exchange ratio by
(ii) the volume-weighted average trading price of a share of the Independent common stock on Nasdaq for the consecutive period of five full trading days
ending on the day immediately preceding the closing date.
Restricted Stock Awards. Each share of restricted stock will fully vest at the effective time of the merger and be considered an outstanding share of
Meridian common stock entitled to receive the merger consideration. The merger consideration will be issued within five business days after the closing
date of the merger, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.

Prior Agreements with Meridian Executive Officers
Employment and Change in Control Agreements with Meridian Executive Officers
East Boston previously entered into an employment agreement with Richard J. Gavegnano. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Independent has agreed to
honor in accordance with its terms all benefits payable under Mr. Gavegnano’s employment agreement. Under the employment agreement, if
Mr. Gavegnano’s employment is terminated by East Boston without “cause” or he resigns for “good reason”, within one year following the closing of the
merger, then, in addition to receiving his accrued but unpaid compensation, he will receive a lump sum cash severance payment equal to 2.99 times his
“base amount” (as defined for purposes of Section 280G of the Code). Mr. Gavegnano’s employment agreement provides for a reduction in payments or
benefits to the extent necessary to avoid such payments or benefits being subject to Section 280G of the Code. For an estimate of the amount that would
be payable to Mr. Gavegnano under the employment agreement, see “—Quantification of Potential Payments to Meridian’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger” below.
East Boston previously entered into substantially similar change in control agreements with John A. Carroll, Kenneth R. Fisher, Edward J. Merritt, John
Migliozzi and Frank P. Romano. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Independent has agreed to honor in accordance with their terms all benefits payable
under these change in control agreements. The change in control agreements provide that if an executive officer’s employment is terminated by East
Boston without “cause” or the executive officer resigns for “good reason”, within two years following the closing of the merger, then, in addition to
receiving his accrued but unpaid compensation, the executive officer will receive (i) a lump sum cash severance payment equal to two times the sum of
the executive officer’s (x) annual base salary and (y) highest level of incentive cash compensation paid over the prior three most recent calendar years
ended before or simultaneously with the change in control and (ii) the executive officer’s continued medical and life insurance coverage for 24 months
following the date of termination, or if such participation under the East Boston’s benefit plans is not permitted or would result in East Boston incurring
penalties, a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to such benefits, payable within 10 business days following the executive officer’s termination.
The existing change in control agreements with Messrs. Carroll, Fisher, Merritt, Migliozzi and Romano provide for a reduction in payments or benefits to
the extent necessary to avoid such payments or benefits being subject to Section 280G of the Code. It is estimated that Mr. Carroll will be paid $837,800
under his change in control agreement. For an estimate of the amount that would be payable to Messrs. Fisher, Merritt, Migliozzi and Romano under the
change in control agreements, see “—Quantification of Potential Payments to Meridian’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger”
below.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreements with Richard J. Gavegnano and Edward J. Merritt
East Boston previously entered into a supplemental executive retirement agreement with Richard J. Gavegnano, which agreement was amended and
restated, effective July 28, 2014 (which is referred to in this document as the SERP). Pursuant to the merger agreement, Independent has agreed to honor
in accordance with its terms all benefits payable under the SERP. Under the SERP, if Mr. Gavegnano terminates employment for any reason other than for
cause, he will receive an annual benefit (paid monthly) equal to 70% of his final average compensation. For purposes of the SERP, final average
compensation equals the three years’ base salary that results in the highest average. The annual benefit is generally payable in the form of an unreduced
life annuity with a 50% spousal survivor annuity, or the actuarial equivalent of this benefit as a single lump sum distribution. Mr. Gavegnano elected to
receive a lump sum payment in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Mr. Gavegnano, who is fully vested in the SERP, will receive an estimated lump
sum cash payment of $7,215,167 as of the closing date of the merger.

East Boston previously entered into a supplemental executive retirement agreement with Edward J. Merritt, which agreement was amended and restated,
effective July 28, 2014 (which is referred to in this document as the Merritt SERP). Pursuant to the merger agreement, Independent has agreed to honor in
accordance with its terms all benefits payable under the Merritt SERP. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Merritt is entitled to the value of the
accumulation account upon his termination of employment, death or disability. This accumulation account had a beginning balance of $716,921 and East
Boston credited the accumulation account with an additional $50,000, as of each December 31st. A final contribution was made on December 31, 2015, as
East Boston and Mr. Merritt agreed to freeze the accumulation of this benefit as of such date. Mr. Merritt, who is fully vested in the Merritt SERP, will
receive an estimated lump sum cash payment of $1,016,921 as of the closing date of the merger.
Supplemental Retirement Agreements with Non-Employee Directors Domenic A. Gambardella and Gregory F. Natalucci
East Boston previously entered into supplemental retirement agreements with each of Messrs. Gambardella and Natalucci. Under the agreements, if the
director terminates service for any reason, the director will receive an annual benefit equal to 50% of his final average compensation. For purposes of the
agreements, a director’s final average compensation equals the average of the director’s annual fees from East Boston and Meridian for the three years
during which the director’s annual fees were the highest. The annual benefit is generally payable in the form of an unreduced life annuity with a 50%
spousal survivor annuity, or the actuarial equivalent of this benefit as a lump sum distribution. Both of the directors elected to receive a lump sum
payment in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Messrs. Gambardella and Natalucci, who are fully vested in their benefits, will receive an estimated
lump sum cash payment of $470,091, and $572,132, respectively, as of the closing date of the merger.
Split Dollar Agreement with Richard J. Gavegnano
East Boston previously entered into a split dollar agreement with Richard J. Gavegnano, effective January 8, 2009. Pursuant to the merger agreement,
Independent has agreed to honor in accordance with its terms all benefits payable under Mr. Gavegnano’s split dollar agreement. The agreement provides
that upon Mr. Gavegnano’s death while employed with East Boston, Mr. Gavegnano’s beneficiary will be entitled to a portion of the death proceeds of the
life insurance policies, payable in a single cash lump sum distribution, in an amount equal to five and one-half (5.5) times Mr. Gavegnano’s most recent
annual base salary. Upon Mr. Gavegnano’s death after his termination of employment with East Boston, Mr. Gavegnano’s beneficiary will be entitled to a
portion of the death proceeds of the life insurance policies, payable in a single cash lump sum distribution, in an amount equal to four and one-half (4.5)
times Mr. Gavegnano’s most recent annual base salary. Mr. Gavegnano’s beneficiary will receive an estimated lump sum cash payment of $4,792,500 upon
Mr. Gavegnano’s death following the closing date of the merger.
Non-Qualified Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan
East Boston maintains the East Boston Savings Bank Non-Qualified Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan, a non-qualified plan, for the purpose
of providing restorative payments to executives designated by the compensation committee of East Boston’s board of directors who are prevented from
receiving the full benefits contemplated by the employee stock ownership plan’s benefit formula due to limitations under the Code. Mr. Gavegnano is the
only participant in the plan. The restorative payment under the plan consist of phantom stock units in lieu of shares that cannot be allocated to the
participant’s account under the employee stock ownership plan due to the legal limitations imposed on tax-qualified plans. The plan does not provide an
additional benefit upon a change in control. As of December 31, 2020, 21,723.8691 phantom units were credited to Mr. Gavegnano’s account. Based on a
price per share of Meridian common stock of $22.40 (the average closing market price of Meridian common stock over the first five business days
following the public announcement of the merger on April 22, 2021), a closing date of June 1, 2021, the value of the phantom units is

In connection with the merger agreement, Rockland Trust entered into an offer letter, dated as of April 22, 2021, with John Migliozzi. Pursuant to
Mr. Migliozzi’s offer letter to join Rockland Trust as Senior Vice President, Managing Director, his term begins on the date of the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and continues through the third anniversary of the date of the closing. In exchange for his
employment with Rockland Trust, Mr. Migliozzi will receive a payout under his existing employment agreement consistent with a termination without
cause, which entitles him to receive an aggregate payment of $978,404, subject to the straight 280G cutback in his change in control agreement. During
the three-year term of his employment, he will be entitled to receive an annual base salary of $400,000, and a maximum annual bonus opportunity of
$150,000. Mr. Migliozzi is also entitled to participate in Rockland Trust employee benefit plans generally available to similarly situated employees. In
consideration of the payments that Rockland Trust will make to Mr. Migliozzi under the offer letter, Mr. Migliozzi agreed to a one-year post-closing non-
solicitation of customers and employees covenants.
In the event of an involuntary termination of Mr. Migliozzi’s employment by the Rockland Trust with cause, (i) (x) if before the third anniversary of the
closing date, he receives 12 months of base pay, or (x) if after the third anniversary and before the fourth anniversary of the closing date, 6 months of
base pay, in each case, payable in a lump sum within 60 days of his termination, and (ii) 12 months of continued medical and dental coverage, or if
continued coverage is not permitted under the Rockland Trust health plans or by law, a lump sum payment equal to the cost of his COBRA premiums for
12 months.
If Mr. Migliozzi resigns for any other reason (except for cause) before the third anniversary of the closing date, he will receive (i) 12 months of base salary,
payable in a lump sum within 60 days following the date of his termination and (ii) 12 months of continued medical and dental coverage, or if continued
coverage is not permitted under the Rockland Trust health plans or by law, a lump sum payment equal to the cost of his COBRA premiums for 12 months.
2021 Pro-Rata Bonuses
The merger agreement provides that Meridian may pay pro-rata bonuses to reflect the level of achievement of performance under the East Boston
Savings Bank – Meridian Interstate Bancorp Incentive Compensation Plan in respect of the portion of the 2021 performance year elapsed prior to the
closing date of the merger (or on a projected year end basis based on reasonable assumptions), which performance determination shall be made based on
the available data as of the latest practicable date prior to the closing date of the merger and otherwise in the ordinary course consistent with past
practices. Such individual bonus amounts will be prorated to reflect the number of days elapsed from January 1, 2021 through the day prior to the closing
date of the merger. It is estimated that the value of the 2021 pro-rata bonus payable to Mr. Carroll will be $106,633 and for an estimate of the 2021 pro-rata
bonuses payable to Messrs. Gavegnano, Fisher, Merritt, Migliozzi and Romano, see

2021 Restricted Stock Awards
The merger agreement provides that Meridian may grant restricted stock awards to certain individuals prior to the closing date of the merger. It is
expected that Messrs. Carroll, Merritt, Migliozzi and Romano, respectively, will each receive a grant of 7,500, 4,500, 4,500 and 4,500, respectively, restricted
stock awards, which will provide for accelerated vesting upon the closing date of the merger. It is estimated that the value of the restricted stock award
grant to Mr. Carroll will be $168,600 and for an estimate of the value of the restricted stock award grants to Messrs. Merritt, Migliozzi and Romano, see
“—Quantification of Potential Payments to Meridian’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” below.
East Boston ESOP Termination
The East Boston ESOP will be terminated at least five business days and no more than seven business days prior to the closing date of the merger. The
East Boston ESOP was funded through a loan to purchase shares of Meridian common stock, which shares are allocated to participants as the loan is
repaid. The unallocated shares are held in a separate unallocated stock fund. Participants’ account balances will become fully vested in connection with
the termination of the East Boston ESOP. On the date the East Boston ESOP is terminated, East Boston will direct the trustee of the East Boston ESOP to
remit a sufficient number of shares of Meridian common stock held in the ESOP unallocated stock fund back to Meridian to repay the outstanding ESOP
loan in full. All remaining shares of Meridian common stock held by the East Boston ESOP as of immediately prior to the closing date of the merger,
including any unallocated shares held in the East Boston ESOP unallocated stock fund (which will not include any shares of Meridian common stock
used for purposes of repaying or forgiving the East Boston ESOP loan) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. Following the
closing date of the merger, the unallocated merger consideration (and any other remaining unallocated assets) will be allocated on a pro rata basis to all
participants with an account balance under the East Boston ESOP based on each participant’s account balance on the termination date.
For an estimate of the amounts related to the termination of the East Boston ESOP that would be allocated to Meridian’s named executive officers’
account balances in the East Boston ESOP, see “—Quantification of Potential Payments to Meridian’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger” and the aggregate estimated amount that would be allocated to Meridian’s executive officers, based on account levels as of December 31, 2020,
and a price per share of Meridian common stock of $22.40 (the average closing market price of Meridian common stock over the first five business days
following the public announcement of the merger on April 22, 2021) who are not named executive officers in connection with the termination of the East
Boston ESOP would be $132,655.
Transition Advisory Board
Following the merger, Independent will invite all of the independent directors serving on Meridian’s board of directors immediatley prior to the merger to
become members of a transition advisory board for two years following the closing. The members of the transition advisory boards will be entitled to
receive annual compensation of $12,000.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Meridian non-employee directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification
and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies following the transaction. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 111 of this Form S-4.

Quantification of Potential Payments to Meridian’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K regarding compensation for each named executive officer of
Meridian that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable
SEC disclosure rules, and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable to Meridian’s named executive officers.
The “golden parachute” compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of holders of Meridian common stock, as
described in the section entitled “Proposal No. 2 - Meridian Compensation Proposal.” The table below sets forth, for the purposes of this golden
parachute disclosure, the amount of payments and benefits (on a pre-tax basis) that each of Meridian’s named executive officers would receive, using the
following assumptions:
 
 
•
 the effective time of the merger will occur on June 1, 2021 (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute
compensation disclosure and which is the last practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus);
 
 
•
 a termination of each named executive officer’s employment without cause, as of immediately following the effective time of the merger and
the payment of Mr. Migliozzi’s cash severance pursuant to the terms of the offer letter (as described above);
 
 
•
 the named executive officer’s base salary rate remaining unchanged from those in place as of June 1, 2021;
 
 
•
 for purposes of calculating the value of non-vested equity awards that will become vested as of the effective time of the merger, equity
awards are those that are outstanding as of June 1, 2021; and
 
 
•
 a price per share of Meridian common stock of $22.40 (the average closing market price of Meridian common stock over the first five
business days following the public announcement of the merger on April 22, 2021).
The calculations in the tables set forth below do not include amounts that Meridian’s named executive officers were already entitled to receive or that
were vested as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The calculations in the table also do not include certain compensation that may
become payable after the closing date of the merger, such as consulting fees, since such payments are contingent upon services to be provided to
Independent following the closing date of the merger. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional equity award grants,
issuances or forfeitures that may occur prior to the completion of the merger except for the proposed grant of restricted stock awards in 2021 (as
described above). As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the
assumptions described in the footnotes to the tables below, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ
from the amounts set forth below.

Completion of the merger is subject to the condition that all consents and approvals of any governmental authority required to consummate the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement shall have been obtained and remain in full force and effect and all statutory waiting
periods in respect thereof shall have expired or been terminated. The merger also is subject to the condition that none of the required regulatory
approvals shall impose a “Burdensome Condition,” which is defined in the merger agreement to mean any prohibition, limitation or other requirement that
would prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Meridian or any of its subsidiaries, or by Independent or any of its subsidiaries, of all or
any material portion of the business or assets of Meridian or any of its subsidiaries or Independent or its subsidiaries, or compel Independent or any of
its subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of Meridian or any of its subsidiaries or Independent or
any of its subsidiaries.
 
96Table of Contents
The consents and approvals of governmental authorities that Independent and Meridian have determined required to consummate the merger and the the
merger of East Boston with Rockland Trust (which is referred to in this document as the bank merger) include:
 
 
•
 the approval of or waiver of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended;
 
 
•
 the FDIC’s approval under the Bank Merger Act; and
 
 
•
 the approval of the Massachusetts Division of Banks under relevant Massachusetts law (Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 167I).
In order to consummate the bank merger, Independent and Meridian must also receive (1) confirmation from the Massachusetts Housing Partnership
Fund (which is referred to in this document as the Housing Partnership Fund) that Independent has made arrangements satisfactory to the Housing
Partnership Fund; and (2) confirmation from the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund (which is referred to in this document as the Massachusetts
DIF) that arrangements satisfactory to the Massachusetts DIF have been made in connection with the termination of Massachusetts DIF deposit
insurance coverage for East Boston Savings Bank in excess of FDIC deposit insurance.
Federal Reserve. Certain of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to approval by the Federal Reserve pursuant to section 3
of the Bank Holding Company Act. In considering the approval of a transaction such as the conversion to a bank holding company and the merger, the
Bank Holding Company Act, requires the Federal Reserve to review: (1) the competitive impact of the transaction, (2) the financial condition and future
prospects, including capital positions and managerial resources, (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the record of the
insured depository institution subsidiaries of the bank holding companies under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”), (4) the effectiveness of
the companies and the depository institutions concerned in combating money-laundering activities, and (5) the extent to which the proposal would result
in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. In connection with its review, the Federal Reserve provides
an opportunity for public comment on the application and is authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if they determine that such meeting
or other proceeding would be appropriate.
Under the CRA, the Federal Reserve must take into account the record of performance of the companies and the depository institutions concerned in
meeting the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, served by such companies and depository
institutions. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA by their primary federal supervisor and are assigned ratings.
In evaluating the record of performance of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served by the institution, the Federal
Reserve considers the institution’s record of compliance with the CRA, including the most recent rating assigned by its primary federal supervisor. As of
their last respective CRA examinations, Rockland Trust was rated “Outstanding” and East Boston was rated “Satsifactory” with respect to CRA
compliance.
The federal Bank Merger Act also mandates that the prior approval of the FDIC, the primary federal regulator of the resulting bank, is required to merge
East Boston Bank with and into Rockland Bank. In evaluating an application filed under the Bank Merger Act, the FDIC generally considers: (1) the
competitive impact of the transaction, (2) financial and managerial resources of the banks party to the bank merger or mergers, (3) the convenience and
needs of the community to be served and the record of the banks under the CRA, including their CRA ratings, (4) the banks’ effectiveness in combating
money-laundering activities and (5) the extent to which the bank merger or mergers would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of
the U.S. banking or financial system. In connection with its review, the FDIC also provides an opportunity for public comment on the application and is
authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if they determine it to be appropriate.

Massachusetts Division of Banks. Certain of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to approval by the Massachusetts
Division of Banks pursuant to Chapter 167I of the Massachusetts General Laws. In evaluating a merger application under these sections, the
Massachusetts Division of Banks will review a proposed merger to determine whether competition among banking institutions will be unreasonably
affected and whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted. In making such determination, the commissioner shall consider, at a minimum,
a showing of net new benefits. Net new benefits may include for example, initial capital investments, job creation plans, consumer and business services,
and commitments to maintain and open branch offices within the continuing institution’s assessment area.
The parties have filed or will file certain applications and notice materials necessary to obtain these regulatory approvals or confirmations in accordance
with applicable law. The merger cannot be completed until all the required approvals and confirmations have been obtained, are in full force and effect and
all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have expired, and the bank merger cannot be completed until after both approvals listed above have been
obtained. The merger may not be consummated until 30 days after the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (or such shorter period as the Federal
Reserve Board may prescribe with the concurrence of the United States Department of Justice, but not less than 15 days), during which time the
Department of Justice may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds. The bank merger may not be consummated until 30 days after the approval of the
FDIC (or such shorter period as the FDIC may prescribe with the concurrence of the United States Department of Justice, but not less than 15 days),
during which time the Department of Justice may challenge the bank merger on antitrust grounds. The commencement of an antitrust action by the
Department of Justice would stay the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve Board or FDIC approval, as the case may be, unless a court specifically orders
otherwise. In reviewing the merger and the bank merger, the Department of Justice could analyze the merger’s effect on competition differently than the
Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, and it is possible that the Department of Justice could reach a different conclusion than the applicable banking
regulator regarding the merger’s (or the bank merger’s) competitive effects.
Independent and Meridian cannot assure you that all required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents will be obtained, when they will be obtained or
whether there will be burdensome conditions in the approvals or any litigation challenging the approvals. Independent and Meridian also cannot assure
you that the United States Department of Justice or the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will not attempt to challenge the
merger on antitrust grounds, or what the outcome will be if such a challenge is made. Independent and Meridian are not aware of any other government
approvals or actions that are required prior to the parties’ consummation of the merger. It is currently contemplated that if any additional governmental
approvals or actions are required, such approvals or actions will be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any of the additional approvals or
actions will be obtained.

Independent has determined that the merger represents a business combination and will account for the merger by applying the acquisition method of
accounting, in accordance with the provisions of Topic 805 “Business Combinations” of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
Standard Codification. As of the date of the merger, Independent will recognize the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed at
their respective estimated fair values. To the extent that the purchase price exceeds the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, Independent will
allocate the excess purchase price to goodwill. The goodwill resulting from the merger will not be amortized to expense, but instead will be reviewed for
impairment at least annually. To the extent goodwill is impaired, its carrying value would be written down to its implied fair value and a charge would be
made to earnings. Core deposit and other intangibles with definite useful lives will be amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives.
The financial statements of Independent issued after the merger will reflect the results attributable to the acquired operations of Meridian beginning on
the date the merger is completed.

Independent common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol “INDB.” Meridian common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the
symbol “EBSB.” In the merger, the Meridian common stock currently listed on the NASDAQ will be delisted from such exchange and deregistered under
the Exchange Act.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Independent will cause the shares of Independent common stock to be issued in the merger to be approved for
listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance. The merger agreement provides that neither Independent nor Meridian will be required to

Litigation Related to the Merger
On June 9, 2021, a complaint, captioned Shiva Stein v. Meridian Bancorp, Inc. et al., No. 1:21-cv-05116-MKV, was filed by a purported stockholder of
Meridian in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint names Meridian and the Meridian board of directors. The
complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants caused a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement relating to the proposed
merger to be filed with the SEC in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The complaint
seeks, among other relief, an injunction preventing the closing of the merger unless and until defendants disclose the allegedly omitted material
information, rescission of the merger to the extent already implemented or awarding of rescissory damages, damages and an award of attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. Meridian believes the claims asserted in the complaint are without merit.

disclosures about Independent and Meridian contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or in the public reports of Independent or Meridian filed

on the other hand, made solely for the benefit of the other. The representations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by Independent,
Rockland Trust, Merger Sub, Meridian and East Boston were qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by Independent, Rockland Trust,
Merger Sub, Meridian and East Boston in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations
and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not
to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and
allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties also may be
subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to shareholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC, and
some were qualified by the matters contained in the confidential disclosure schedules that Independent and Meridian each delivered in connection with
the merger agreement and certain documents filed with the SEC. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and
warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, may have changed since the date of the merger

provided, however, that if the approval date occurs during the month immediately prior to the start of Independent’s next fiscal quarter the closing will
occur on the last business day of the month in which the approval date occurs with an effective time as of 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month of
Independent’s next fiscal quarter.
We currently expect that the merger will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to approval of the share issuance by shareholders of
Independent and the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions it contemplates by the stockholders of Meridian, the receipt of all necessary
regulatory approvals and/or waivers, and the expiration of all regulatory waiting periods. However, there can be no assurances as to whether, or when,
Meridian and Independent will obtain the required approvals or complete the merger.",111,112

Each share of Meridian common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares held as treasury
stock or shares owned directly by Independent in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like) will be converted into the right to receive 0.275 of a
share of Independent common stock (the “exchange ratio”). Each share of Independent common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will remain issued and outstanding as one share of common stock of Independent.
If Independent changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Independent common stock
issued and outstanding prior to the effective time as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding Independent common stock, the exchange ratio will be proportionately and appropriately adjusted so as to
provide the holders of Meridian common stock the same economic benefit as contemplated by merger agreement prior to that event; provided that no
adjustment will be made with regard to Independent common stock if (i) Independent issues additional shares of Independent common stock and receives
consideration for such shares (including upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or other equity awards) or (ii) Independent issues employee or
director stock grants or similar equity awards pursuant to an Independent benefit plan.
Independent will not issue any fractional shares of its common stock in the merger, but will instead pay cash (determined on the basis of the volume-
weighted average trading price per share of Independent common stock for the five consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately
preceding the closing date, rounded to the nearest whole cent as provided by Bloomberg L.P.) for any fractional share a Meridian stockholder would
otherwise receive after aggregating all of his or her shares (the exchange ratio and any cash in lieu of fractional shares collectively, the “merger
consideration”).",112,112

Meridian Options
At the effective time, each stock option granted under Meridian’s equity-based compensation plans, whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and which has not been exercised or canceled prior thereto, will fully vest and be cancelled at the
effective time of the merger. On the closing date of the merger, East Boston or Meridian will pay to the holders of such stock options cash in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Meridian common stock provided for in each such stock option, and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the per
share cash equivalent consideration over (y) the exercise price. Any stock option for which the exercise price per share of Meridian common stock
provided for in such stock option exceeds the per share cash equivalent consideration will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger without
payment. The cash payment will be paid within five business days after the closing date of the merger, will be made without interest and will be net of all
applicable withholding taxes.
Meridian Restricted Stock Awards
At the effective time, all unvested shares of restricted stock awarded under Meridian’s equity-based compensation plans will automatically vest in full, to
the extent not previously forfeited, and will be considered outstanding shares of Meridian common stock entitled to receive the merger consideration.

Exchange Procedures
On or prior to the closing date of the merger, Independent will cause to be delivered to the exchange agent certificates representing the shares of
Independent common stock, or evidence of the shares in book entry form, to be issued in the merger. In addition, Independent will deliver to the exchange
agent an aggregate amount of cash equal to the estimated amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Independent common stock. Independent
has selected Computershare Limited to act as the exchange agent in connection with the merger.
The conversion of Meridian common stock into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at the effective time of the merger.
For shares of Meridian common stock held in book entry form, Independent will establish procedures for delivery which are be reasonably acceptable to
Meridian.
As promptly as practicable after the effective time, and in any event within five business days thereafter, the exchange agent will mail to each Meridian
stockholder of record at the effective time of the merger who did not previously surrender his or her Meridian stock certificates, a letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in surrendering the stockholder’s Meridian stock certificates. When Meridian stockholders deliver their Meridian stock certificates to
the exchange agent along with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, their Meridian stock
certificates will be cancelled and in exchange they will receive:
 
 
•
 Independent stock certificates or evidence of shares in book entry form representing the number of whole shares of Independent common
stock that they are entitled to receive under the merger agreement; and/or
 
 
•
 a check representing the amount of cash that they are entitled to receive in lieu of fractional shares, if any.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Independent common stock.
Independent will issue a stock certificate for Independent common stock (or evidence of the shares in book entry form) or a check for cash in lieu of a
fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered
 
102Table of Contents
Meridian stock certificate is registered only if the exchange agent is presented with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of
ownership, together with evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Dividends and Distributions
Meridian stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on Independent common stock with a record date after the closing
date of the merger until they have surrendered their Meridian stock certificates in exchange for an Independent stock certificate representing the shares
of Independent common stock they are entitled to receive (or evidence of the shares in book entry form). After the surrender of their Meridian stock
certificates, Meridian stockholders of record will be entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, without interest, which had become payable
with respect to their Independent common stock and any unpaid dividend with respect to their Meridian common stock with a record date that is prior to
the effective time.
Withholding
Independent (through the exchange agent) will be entitled to deduct and withhold, from any amounts otherwise payable under the merger agreement to
any holder of Meridian common stock the amounts it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign tax law.
Any such amounts deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the holder from whom they
were withheld.",113,114

East Boston Employee Stock Ownership Plan
The East Boston ESOP will be terminated at least five business days and no more than seven business days prior to the effective time of the merger. The
East Boston ESOP is funded through a loan to purchase shares of Meridian common stock, which shares are allocated to participants as the loan is
repaid. The unallocated shares are held in a separate unallocated stock fund. Participants’ account balances will become fully vested in connection with
the termination of the East Boston ESOP. On the date the East Boston ESOP is terminated, East Boston will direct the trustee of the East Boston ESOP to
remit a sufficient number of shares of Meridian common stock held in the ESOP loan suspense account back to East Boston to repay the outstanding
ESOP loan in full. All remaining shares of Meridian common stock held by the East Boston ESOP as of immediately prior to the effective time, including
any unallocated shares held in the East Boston ESOP loan suspense account (which will not include any shares of Meridian common stock used for
purposes of repaying or forgiving the East Boston ESOP loans) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. Following the
effective time, the unallocated merger consideration (and any other remaining unallocated assets) will be allocated on a pro rata basis to all participants
with an account balance under the East Boston ESOP based on the size of each participant’s account balance on the termination date.
Charitable Foundation
Meridian will use its best efforts to take all necessary action to, effective as of the effective time, (i) have the then current directors and officers of the
East Boston Savings Bank Charitable Foundation resign, (ii) appoint the
 
110
Table of Contents
individuals who then serve as directors and officers of the Rockland Trust Charitable Foundation to also serve as directors and officers of the East
Boston Savings Bank Charitable Foundation, (iii) also appoint two individuals designated by Meridian to serve as directors of the East Boston Savings
Bank Charitable Foundation, and (iv) change the name of the East Boston Savings Bank Charitable Foundation to “Rockland Trust – East Boston
Savings Bank Charitable Foundation.
If the effective time occurs prior to the East Boston Savings Bank Charitable Foundation making grant decisions and/or grants in response to
applications submitted to the East Boston Savings Bank Charitable Foundation by the August 31, 2021 deadline (the “2021 grant applications”),
Rockland Trust will use its best efforts to take all necessary action to have “Rockland Trust—East Boston Savings Bank Charitable Foundation” make
grant decisions and grants in response to the 2021 Grant Applications as directed in writing by the person who served as CEO of the East Boston
immediately prior to the effective time.
Advisory Board
Following the closing, Independent will invite each of the independent members (under the NASDAQ listing standards) of the Meridian board of
directors as of immediately prior to the closing (the “Meridian transition board directors”) to serve as members of a Transition Advisory Board (the
“Advisory Board”) of Independent for a term beginning promptly following the closing and ending on the second anniversary of the closing date.
Independent may consult with the Advisory Board with respect to integration matters, and the East Boston transition board directors who serve on the
Advisory Board will be entitled to annual compensation of $12,000 for their service.
Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance
The merger agreement provides that after the effective time, Independent as the surviving entity in the merger will indemnify and hold harmless all
present and former directors and officers of Meridian and its subsidiaries against, and will advance expenses as incurred to such persons in respect of, all
costs and liabilities arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of Meridian or its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request
of Meridian or its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of
the merger, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Meridian articles of incorporation, the Meridian bylaws and the governing or
organizational documents of any subsidiary of Meridian; provided, that in the case of advancement of expenses, any such person provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. All rights to indemnification as
provided in any indemnification agreement in existence on the date of the merger will survive the merger and be honored by Independent as the surviving
entity in the merger.
Prior to the closing, Meridian will (and if Meridian is unable to prior to closing, Independent will cause the surviving company to) obtain and fully pay the
premium for the extension of Meridian’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the effective time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Meridian’s current insurance carrier
with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions, and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
indemnified parties thereunder as Meridian’s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of Meridian or any of its subsidiaries. However, in no event will
Meridian expend, or Independent or the surviving company be required to expend, for such “tail” policy in the aggregate a premium amount in excess of
an amount equal to 200% of the annual premiums paid by Meridian for directors and officers insurance in effect as of the date of the merger agreement.
Certain Additional Covenants
The merger agreement also contains mutual covenants relating to the preparation of this document, access to information of the other company, public
announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by the

merger agreement, notification of certain changes, board packages and director resignations, litigation, information systems conversion, coordination of
agreements by Meridian and coordination of dividends, de-listing of Meridian common stock from Nasdaq, allowing Independent access to Meridian’s
customers and suppliers and to conduct environmental assessments of certain real property owned by Meridian and certain reporting requirements of

Benefit Plans
The merger agreement provides that following the closing date of the merger, Independent may choose to maintain any or all of Meridian’s benefit plans
in its sole discretion. If any Meridian benefit plan terminated for which there is a comparable Independent benefit plan of general applicability, those
individuals who are employees of Meridian and its subsidiaries and who continue as employees of Independent or any of its subsidiaries will be entitled
to participate in the Independent benefit plan to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Independent or Rockland Trust. In addition,
continuing Meridian employees who experience a qualifying termination of employment within one year following the effective time and who are not
otherwise covered by a contractual severance arrangement would be eligible, subject to the execution of a release of claims in favor of Rockland Trust, for
severance pay in a lump sum equal to the amount determined under the East Boston Amended and Restated Employee Severance Compensation Plan
(subject to a minimum of eight weeks of base compensation).
With respect to the comparable Independent benefit plan, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and
vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of benefits under any Independent benefit plan, including any post-retirement welfare benefit plan but excluding
any severance, vacation and/or paid time off plans), service by a Meridian employee will be recognized to the same extent such service was recognized
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger under a comparable employee benefit plan in which such Meridian employee was a participant
immediately prior to the effective time, or, if there is no comparable employee benefit plan, to the same extent such service was recognized under the
Meridian 401(k) plan immediately prior to the effective time of the merger to the extent applicable; provided, however, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.
Independent will cause each benefit plan providing medical, health or dental benefits to continuing employees to waive any preexisting condition
limitations relating to any conditions that were covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of Meridian and its subsidiaries, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide full credit for any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the plan year prior to participation, and use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to the continuing employee, in each case to the extent the employee had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the effective time of the merger for the plan year in which the effective time
of the merger occurs.
Independent will continue to be obligated to perform all vested benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, continuing employees existing as of the
effective time, as well as all employment, severance, deferred compensation, retirement or “change-in-control” agreements, plans, or policies of East
Boston.

the extent that the Meridian board of directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor) that such acquisition proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal and failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that, prior to or concurrently with providing any such
nonpublic information permitted to be provided, Meridian will provide such information to Independent, and will enter into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the confidentiality agreement between Independent and Meridian, and such confidentiality
agreement may not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Meridian.
Meridian has also agreed to (i) promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) business day) advise Independent following receipt of any acquisition
proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to a
 
114Table of Contents
superior proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
acquisition proposal), and will keep Independent reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or acquisition proposal. Meridian will also use its reasonable best efforts,

The following section summarizes material provisions of the separate voting agreements (each, a “voting agreement”), dated as of April 22, 2021, by and
between Independent and the directors and executive officers of Meridian. A form of the voting agreements is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex D and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and qualifies the following summary in its entirety. The rights and obligations of parties to
the voting agreements are governed by the voting agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in or incorporated by reference

statement/prospectus, before making any decisions regarding the proposals.
Pursuant to the separate voting agreements between Independent and each of the Meridian directors and executive officers, which were executed
concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, the directors and executive officers of Meridian agreed, with respect to shares of Meridian
common stock that they own solely or jointly or have direct or indirect control over, to:
 
 
•
 restrict their ability to sell, transfer, pledge, assign or dispose of their shares of Meridian common stock during the term of the voting
agreement;
 
 
•
 appear at the Meridian stockholder meeting or otherwise cause their shares of Meridian common stock to be counted as present at the
stockholder meeting for purposes of calculating a quorum;
 
 
•
 vote their shares of Meridian common stock in favor of adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the transactions it
contemplates;

•
 vote their shares of Meridian common stock against any proposal to acquire Meridian by any person other than Independent or against any
action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay,
postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and
 
 
•
 not to vote or execute any written consent to rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a stockholder of
Meridian, to approve or adopt the merger agreement unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.
The voting agreements were executed as a condition of Independent’s willingness to enter into the merger agreement.
On the record date of June 17, 2021, these directors and executive officers solely or jointly and directly or indirectly owned an aggregate of 1,868,586
shares, which they have agreed to vote in favor of the merger agreement at the Meridian stockholder meeting. These shares represent approximately

The following section describes the anticipated material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger to U.S. holders (as
defined below) of Meridian common stock. This discussion addresses only those holders that hold their Meridian common stock as a capital asset within
the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment), and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their individual circumstances or to holders that are subject to special rules, such as, for example:
 
 
•
 financial institutions;
 
 
•
 insurance companies;
 
 
•
 retirement plans;
 
 
•
 individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts;
 
 
•
 mutual funds;
 
 
•
 persons subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code;
 
 
•
 entities treated as partnerships or other flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors in such partnerships or other
flow-through entities;
 
 
•
 tax-exempt organizations or government organizations;
 
 
•
 dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies;
 
 
•
 controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies;
 
 
•
 persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
 
 
•
 traders in securities that elect to use a mark to market method of accounting;
 
 
•
 regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts and regulated mortgage investment conduits;
 
 
•
 persons whose Meridian common stock is qualified small business stock for purposes of Section 1202 of the Code;
 
 
•
 certain former U.S. citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 
 
•
 persons that immediately before the merger actually or constructively own at least five percent of Meridian common stock (by vote or
value);
 
 
•
 persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable
financial statement;
 
 
•
 persons that hold Meridian common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or conversion transaction; or
 
 
•
 persons who acquired their shares of Meridian common stock through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as
compensation, through the exercise of warrants, or through a tax-qualified retirement plan.
In addition, this discussion does not address the tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger to holders of Meridian stock other than U.S.
holders.
The following is based upon the Code, its legislative history, Treasury regulations promulgated pursuant to the Code and published rulings and
decisions, all as currently in effect as of the date of this document, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and to differing
interpretations. Any such change or
 
121Table of Contents
differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. Tax considerations under state, local and
foreign laws, or federal laws other than those pertaining to U.S. federal income tax, and any tax consequences arising under the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax, are not addressed in this discussion.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Meridian common stock that is:
 
 
•
 an individual U.S. citizen or resident, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 
 
•
 a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any of its political subdivisions;
 
 
•
 a trust that is a U.S. resident trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, i.e., a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and the control over all substantial decisions of such trust is vested in one or more
U.S. persons or (ii) such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S.
federal income tax purposes; or
 
 
•
 an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Meridian common stock, the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of a partner in such a partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any entity treated
as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Meridian common stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult their own
tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger to their specific circumstances.
The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger under current law and is
for general information only. This discussion is not intended to be tax advice to any particular holder of Meridian common stock. Tax matters regarding
the merger and the holdco merger are complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger to each Meridian stockholder will
depend on their particular situation. Meridian stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences of the merger
and the holdco merger to them, including the application and effect of state, local, federal, foreign and other tax laws.

Independent and Meridian have structured the merger and the holdco merger, taken together, to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and it is anticipated that they will qualify as such. It is a condition to Independent’s obligation to complete the merger that
Independent receive an opinion of its legal counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, dated as of the closing date of the merger, to the effect that the
merger and the holdco merger, taken together, will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to
Meridian’s obligation to complete the merger that Meridian receive an opinion of its legal counsel, Luse Gorman, PC, dated as of the closing date of the
merger, to the effect that the merger and the holdco merger, taken together, will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. These opinions will be based on, among other things, certain facts, assumptions, representations, warranties and covenants, including those
contained in the merger agreement and in letters and certificates provided by Meridian and Independent. If any of the facts, assumptions,
representations, warranties or covenants upon which the opinions are based are inaccurate or inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger could be adversely affected. None of the tax opinions given in connection with the merger and the
holdco merger or the opinions described below will be binding on the Internal Revenue Service. Neither Independent nor Meridian has requested or
intends to request any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and
 
122Table of Contents
the holdco merger. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a
position contrary to any of those set forth below.
Assuming that the merger and the holdco merger, taken together, qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the material
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger will generally be as follows:
Exchange of Meridian Common Stock for Independent Common Stock. Meridian stockholders generally will not recognize any gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes on the receipt of Independent common stock in exchange for Meridian common stock, except with respect to any cash received
instead of a fractional share of Independent common stock (as discussed below). The aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of Independent common
stock received by the Meridian stockholder (including any fractional shares deemed received and redeemed for cash as described below) generally will
equal the basis of the shares of Meridian common stock surrendered in exchange for the shares of Independent common stock. The holding period for
shares of Independent common stock received by the Meridian stockholder (including any fractional share deemed received and sold for cash as
described below) generally will include the stockholder’s holding period for the Meridian common stock surrendered in exchange for the Independent
common stock.
If a U.S. holder of Meridian common stock acquired different blocks of Meridian common stock at different times or different prices, any gain or loss will
be determined separately with respect to each block of Meridian common stock and the U.S. holder’s bases and holding periods in their shares of
Independent common stock may be determined with reference to each block of Meridian common stock. Any such holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the manner in which Independent common stock received in the merger should be allocated among different blocks of Meridian
common stock and regarding their bases and holding periods in the particular shares of Independent common stock received in the merger.
Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares. Meridian stockholders who receive cash in lieu of a fractional share of Independent common stock in the merger
generally will be treated as having received such fractional share in the merger and then having sold such fractional share for cash. Gain or loss generally
will be recognized based on the difference between the amount of cash received in lieu of the fractional share and the basis in the fractional share
(determined as set forth above). Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder’s
holding period for such fractional share (including the holding period of the shares of Meridian common stock surrendered therefor) exceeds one year at
the effective time of the merger. Long-term capital gains of individuals are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding",133,134
"Meridian Bancorp, Inc._20210622_DEFM14A_19361639_4244116.Pdf",Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,"Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Meridian stockholders generally will be subject to information reporting and, under certain circumstances, U.S. federal backup withholding (currently at a
rate of 24%), on cash received pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to Meridian stockholders who (1) furnish a correct
taxpayer identification number, certify that they are not subject to backup withholding and otherwise comply with all the applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules; or (2) provide proof that they are otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against the Meridian stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability,
provided that the Meridian stockholder timely furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service.
THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER AND THE
HOLDCO MERGER UNDER CURRENT LAW AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL
TAX CONSEQUENCES RELEVANT THERETO. STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER AND THE HOLDCO MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL,
STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND ANY PROPOSED CHANGES TO APPLICABLE TAX LAWS.

This section describes the differences between the rights of holders of Meridian common stock and the rights of holders of Independent common stock.
While we believe that the description covers the material differences between the rights of the holders, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You should carefully read this entire document and refer to the other documents discussed below for a more
complete understanding of the differences between your rights as a holder of Meridian common stock and your rights as a holder of Independent
common stock.
As a stockholder of Meridian, a Maryland corporation, your rights are governed by Maryland law, Meridian’s articles of incorporation, as currently in
effect, and Meridian’s bylaws, as currently in effect. When the merger becomes effective and you receive Independent common stock in exchange for
your Meridian shares, you will become a shareholder of Independent, a Massachusetts corporation. Independent’s common stock is listed on NASDAQ
under the symbol “INDB.” As an Independent shareholder, your rights will be governed by Massachusetts law, Independent’s articles of organization, as
in effect from time to time, and Independent’s bylaws, as in effect from time to time.
The following discussion of the rights of Meridian stockholders under Maryland law and Independent shareholders under Massachusetts law, and the
similarities and material differences between (i) the rights of Meridian stockholders under the articles of organization and bylaws of Meridian and (ii) the
rights of Independent shareholders under the articles of organization and bylaws of Independent. This discussion is only a summary of some provisions
and is not a complete description of these similarities and differences. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to Maryland and
Massachusetts law and the full texts of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Meridian and of the articles of organization and bylaws of
Independent.
 
 
  
Meridian
  
Independent
Capitalization
  
The total authorized capital stock of Meridian consists of
100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share,
and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value per share.
As of the record date, there were 52,584,413 shares of common
stock outstanding held by approximately 1,708 holders of
record, including shares held in the East Boston ESOP, and no
shares of preferred stock outstanding.
  
The total authorized capital stock of Independent consists of
75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share
and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share. As of the record date, there were 33,038,752 shares of
common stock outstanding held by approximately 2,892
holders of record, and no shares of preferred stock
outstanding.
Preemptive Rights
  
A preemptive right allows a shareholder to maintain its proportionate share of ownership of a corporation by permitting the
shareholder to purchase a proportionate share of any new stock issuances. Preemptive rights protect the shareholders from
dilution of value and control upon new stock issuances. For a Maryland corporation incorporated on or after October 1,
1995, unless the articles of incorporation expressly grants such rights to the stockholder, a stockholder does not have any
preemptive rights. Under Massachusetts law, unless the articles of organization say otherwise, shareholders have no
preemptive rights.
  
Meridian’s articles of incorporation state that stockholders will
not have preemptive rights except for those approved by the
board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a
majority of the directors then in office. Currently, Meridian’s
stockholders do not have preemptive rights.
  
Independent does not have a provision authorizing
preemptive rights; in fact, Independent’s articles of
organization contain provisions specifically denying them.
Accordingly, Independent’s shareholders do not have
preemptive rights.
 
127Table of Contents
 
  
Meridian
  
Independent
Limitations on Voting
Rights
  
Meridian’s articles of incorporation provide that no record
holders of any outstanding common stock of Meridian that is
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by a person who
beneficially owns more than 10% of the then-outstanding
shares of common stock of Meridian will be permitted to vote
any shares held in excess of the 10% limit unless, before the
person acquired beneficial ownership of such shares in excess
of the 10% limit, such acquisition of shares was approved by a
majority of Meridian’s unaffiliated directors. This limitation does
not apply to directors or officers acting solely in their capacities
as directors and officers, or to any employee stock ownership or
similar plan of Meridian or any of its subsidiaries or to trustees
of such plans solely by reason of their capacity as trustees. In
addition, Meridian’s board of directors has the power to
construe and apply the provisions in the articles of
incorporation regarding the 10% limitation on voting rights and
to make all determinations necessary or desirable to implement
these provisions.
  
Neither of Independent’s articles of organization or bylaws
contain limitations on the voting rights of the equity securities
of Independent, nor are such limitations applicable to
Independent’s equity securities under Massachusetts
corporate law.
Dividends and Other
Stock Rights
  
Holders of Meridian common stock are entitled to receive such
dividends as the board of directors may declare out of funds
legally available for such payment, subject to the rights of
holders of preferred stock. The Meridian board of directors is
also authorized to issue “blank check” preferred stock to:
(i) provide for the issuance of the shares of preferred stock in
series, (ii) establish from time to time the number of shares to be
included in each such series, and (iii) fix the preferences,
conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and
conditions of redemption of the shares of each such series.
  
Independent can also pay dividends on its common stock in
accordance with Massachusetts law. Independent’s board of

When and if a quarterly cash dividend is declared by the
board of directors, if any Independent shares of preferred
stock are outstanding, the holders of shares of preferred stock
will be entitled to receive dividends in an amount per share
described in Independent’s articles of organization, subject to
the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of
preferred stock ranking prior and superior to Independent
preferred stock with respect to dividends.
Right to Call Special
Meetings of
Stockholders of
Meridian and of
Shareholders of
Independent
  
Special meetings may be called:
 
•  by the president;
 
•  by the chairperson of the board of directors;
 
•  by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted
by the majority of the total number of directors that
Meridian would have if there were no vacancies on the
board of directors; or
 
•  by the secretary at the written request of stockholders
entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to
be cast at the meeting.
  
Special meetings may be called:
 
•  by the chairman of the board, if any;
 
•  by the president;
 
•  by a majority of the directors; or
 
•  by the secretary, or in case of the death, absence,
incapacity or refusal of the secretary, by any other officer,
at the written direction of the holders of at least two-
thirds of the capital stock of the Independent entitled to
vote at the meeting.
 
For shareholders to call a special meeting, Independent
requires the written application of the holders of at least two-
thirds of the capital stock, as opposed to the written request of
stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast at the meeting that is required for Meridian
stockholders to call a special meeting. Therefore, it may be
more difficult for Independent’s shareholders to call a special
meeting.
Notice of Stockholder
Meetings
  
Meridian requires that notice of stockholder meetings be given
not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the meeting.
  
Independent requires that notice of shareholder meetings be
given not less than 7 days nor more than 60 days before the
meeting.
Board of Directors–
Number and Term of
Office
  
Meridian’s articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that the
number of directors of Meridian shall, by virtue of Meridian’s
election made to be governed by Section 3-804(b) of the
Maryland General Corporation Law (which is referred to in this
document as the MGCL), be fixed from time to time exclusively
by vote of the board of directors; provided, however, that such
number shall never be less than the minimum
  
Independent’s bylaws and articles of organization provide that
the number of directors shall be between three and 25 as fixed
from time to time by vote of the board of directors at any
regular or special meeting thereof. The board of directors may
increase or decrease the number of directors in one or more
classes to ensure that the three classes shall be as nearly
equal as possible. “Preference Stock Directors” are those who

number of directors required by the MGCL. Currently,
Meridian’s board of directors is set at 11 directors.
 
Meridian’s articles of incorporation and bylaws provide further
that the directors, other than those who may be elected by the
holders of preferred stock, shall be divided into three classes, as
nearly equally as possible, creating a staggered board of
directors. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors
elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire will be
elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding
annual meeting of stockholders after their election or for such
shorter period of time as the board of directors may determine,
with each director to hold office until his or her term expires and
until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified.
The vote of a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting is required
to elect directors of Meridian. Stockholders are not permitted to
cumulate their votes in the election of directors.
 
Meridian’s bylaws also provide that any vacancy occurring in
the board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an
increase in the number of directors or the death, resignation or
removal of a director, may be filled only by the affirmative vote
of two-thirds of the remaining directors then in office, even if
such directors do not constitute a quorum. A director elected to
fill a vacancy will be elected to serve for the remainder of the full
term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and
until the director’s successor is elected and qualified.
 
Among the eligibility criteria set forth in Section 12 of
Meridian’s bylaws is the requirement that no person can be
qualified to serve as a director of Meridian after December 31 in
the year such person reaches the age of 75.
  
may be elected by the holders of any class or series of stock
having a preference over the common stock as to dividends or
upon liquidation. Directors other than Preference Stock
Directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equally
as possible, creating a staggered board of directors.
 
Independent’s bylaws and governance principles provide for
majority voting in uncontested director elections. In an
uncontested election, if an incumbent director standing for
election is not reelected by a majority of the votes cast, the
director is required to promptly tender a notice of resignation
to the board of directors. The resignation is not effective
unless accepted by the board of directors. The nominating
committee would then recommend whether the board of
directors should accept or reject a tendered resignation. In
determining whether to accept a tendered resignation, the
board of directors would consider the potential impact of the
resignation on compliance with applicable legal and listing
standards and any other factors deemed relevant. An election
is uncontested if the number of persons nominated does not
exceed the number of director positions to be filled at the
meeting. In contested elections, the vote standard would be a
plurality of votes cast.
 
No director shall continue to serve once he or she attains the
age of 72. Except for Preference Stock Directors, newly created
directorships and vacancies on the board of directors shall be
filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining
directors then in office, even though less than a quorum. Any
director so elected shall hold office for the remainder of the full
term of the class of directors in which the new directorship
was created or the vacancy occurred.

Meridian’s articles of incorporation provide that advance notice
of stockholder nomination for the election of directors and of
business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of

Removal and
Resignation of
Directors
  
Meridian’s bylaws provide that a director may resign at any time
by giving written notice of such resignation to the president or
secretary of Meridian at Meridian’s principal office. Unless
otherwise specified in the written notice, the resignation will
take effect upon receipt of the written notice.
 
Meridian’s articles of incorporation provide that, subject to the
rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock then
outstanding, any director, or the entire board of directors, may
be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only
by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of
the voting power of all of the then-shares of capital stock of
Meridian outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors (after giving effect to the restrictions on
voting rights described above),voting together as a single class.  
Independent does not make specific provision for a method of
resignation, but the bylaws do provide that vacancies can
arise from resignation. A director may be removed for cause by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all shares of
the corporation outstanding and then entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors.
Amendment of Bylaws
  
Meridian’s articles of incorporation provide that the bylaws may
be amended or repealed by the approval of a majority of the
total number of directors that Meridian would have if there were
no vacancies on the board of directors at the time any such
resolution is presented to the board of directors for adoption
(which is referred to as the whole board). The bylaws may also
be amended or repealed by an affirmative vote of the holders of
at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding
shares of capital stock of Meridian entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors (after giving effect to the restrictions on
voting rights described above), voting together as a single

of Incorporation and
Articles of
Organization
  
Meridian’s articles of incorporation provide that Meridian
reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision of the
articles of incorporation as prescribed by the MGCL, including
any amendment altering the terms or contract rights, as
expressly set forth in the articles of incorporation, of any of the
outstanding stock by classification, reclassification or
otherwise, and no stockholder approval shall be required if the
approval of stockholders is not required for the proposed
amendment or repeal by the MGCL, and all rights conferred
upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation. The
board of directors, pursuant to a resolution approved by a
majority of the whole board (rounded up to the nearest whole
number), and without action by the stockholders, may amend
the articles of incorporation to increase or decrease the
aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of
stock of any class or series that Meridian has authority to issue.
 
No proposed amendment or repeal of any provision of the
articles of incorporation will be submitted to a stockholder vote
unless the board of directors has (i) approved the proposed
amendment or repeal, (ii) determined that it is advisable, and
(iii) directed that it be submitted for consideration at either an
annual or special meeting of the stockholders pursuant to a
resolution approved by the board of directors. Any proposed
amendment or repeal of any provision of the articles of
incorporation may be abandoned by the board of directors at
any time before its effective time upon the adoption of a
resolution approved by a majority of the whole board (rounded
up to the nearest whole number).

incorporation need only be approved by the vote of a majority

the restrictions on voting rights described above), if the
amendment or repeal of such provision is approved by the
board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by at least
two-thirds of the whole board (rounded up to the nearest whole
number).
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the articles of
incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise
permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of
the holders of any class or series of the stock of Meridian
required by law or by the articles of incorporation, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting
power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock
of Meridian entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(after giving effect to the restrictions on voting rights described
above), voting together as a single class, is required to amend
or repeal certain provisions of the articles of incorporation.
  
Limitation of Liability
and Indemnification
  
Meridian’s articles of incorporation provide for the limitation of
liability of officers and directors. Under the articles of
incorporation, an officer or director of Meridian, as such, will
not be liable to Meridian or its stockholders for money damages,
except (i) to the extent that it is proved that the officer or
director actually received an improper benefit or profit in money,
property or services, for the amount of the benefit or profit in
money, property or services actually received, or (ii) to the
extent that a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the
director or officer is entered in a proceeding based on a finding
in the proceeding that the director’s or officer’s action, or failure
to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and
was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the
proceeding; or (iii) to the extent otherwise provided by the
  
Independent’s bylaws and articles of organization provide for
the limitation of liability of directors and officers. Under the
articles of organization, a director or officer shall not be
personally liable to Independent or its shareholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or
officer; provided, however, that the articles of organization do
not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach
of the director’s or officer’s duty of loyalty to Independent or
its shareholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or
which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, (iii) for improper distributions under Section 6.40 of
Chapter 156D of the General Laws of Massachusetts, or
(iv) for any transaction from which the director or officer
derived an improper personal benefit. The stated intention of
the

MGCL. However, if the MGCL is amended to further eliminate or
limit the personal liability of officers and directors, then the
liability of officers and directors of Meridian will be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the MGCL, as so
amended; provided, that, any repeal or modification of the
foregoing by the stockholders of Meridian will not adversely
affect any right or protection of a director or officer of Meridian
existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
 
Meridian’s articles of incorporation also provide for
indemnification of (i) Meridian’s current and former directors
and officers, whether serving Meridian or at its request any
other entity, to the fullest extent required or permitted by the
MGCL, including the advancement of expenses under the
procedures and to the fullest extent permitted by law; and
(ii) other employees and agents to such extent as authorized by
the board of directors and permitted by law; provided, however,
that, except as provided in Article 10, Section B of the articles of
incorporation with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, Meridian will indemnify any indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the
indemnitee only if the proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by Meridian’s board of directors.
 
Maryland law applicable to Meridian generally provides that a
corporation may indemnify a director or officer who is a party to
a threatened, pending or completed proceeding unless it is
established that (i) the director’s act or omission was material to
the matter giving rise to the proceeding and was committed in
bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty;
(ii) the director actually received an improper personal benefit in
money, property, or services; or (iii) in the case of any criminal
proceeding, the director had reasonable cause to believe that
the act or omission was unlawful.
  
provision of the articles of organization is to limit the liability
of a director or officer to the maximum extent allowed by law.
To that end, the articles of organization further provide that if
the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act is amended to
authorize the further elimination of, or limitation on, the liability
of directors or officers, then the liability of a director or officer
of Independent, in addition to the limitation of personal
liability provided herein, shall be limited to the full extent
permitted by the amendment or amendments.
 
Independent’s bylaws and articles of organization provide for
indemnification of a director or officer by Independent against
all liabilities incurred or suffered by the director or officer or on
his or her behalf in connection with any threatened, pending,
or completed proceeding (without regard to whether the basis
of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director or officer or in any other capacity for or on behalf of
the corporation while serving as a director or officer) or any
claim, issue or matter therein, which proceeding such director
or officer is, or is threated to be made, a party to or participant
by reason of such director’s or officer’s corporate status, but
only if (i)(A) the director or officer conducted himself or
herself in good faith; (B) he or she reasonably believed that
his or her conduct was in the best interests of Independent or
that his or her conduct was at least not opposed to the best
interests of Independent; and (C) in the case of any criminal
proceeding, he or she had no reasonable cause to believe his
or her conduct was unlawful; or (ii) the director or officer
engaged in conduct for which he or she shall not be liable
under Section 7 of Article VI of the articles of organization.
 
However, Independent is not required to indemnify or advance
expenses to a director or officer in connection with a
proceeding initiated by the director or officer (including,
without limitation, any cross-claim or counterclaim), unless the
initiation of such proceeding was authorized by the board of
directors. The rights of indemnification
 
136
Table of Contents
 
  
Meridian
  
Independent
  
  
continue as to a director or officer and inure to the benefit of
his or her heirs, estate, executors, administrators and personal
representatives. As with the limitation on liability of directors
and officers, the articles of organization provide that, if the
Massachusetts Business Corporation Act is amended, then
the indemnification of a director or officer, in addition to the
indemnification provided in the articles of organization, shall
be provided to the fullest extent permitted by the amendment
or amendments.
 
In addition, the termination of a proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, is not, of itself, determinative that
the director or officer did not meet the relevant standard
described above.
 
The bylaws and articles of organization further provide that a
director’s or officer’s conduct with respect to an employee
benefit plan for a purpose he or she reasonably believed to be
in the interests of the participants in, and the beneficiaries of,
the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirement that his or
her conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests of
Independent.
 
Except in the circumstances described above, Independent
may only indemnify a director or officer if so ordered by a
court.
 
The determination of whether an officer or director has met the
requirements for indemnification shall be made (i) if there are
two or more disinterested directors, by the board of directors
by a majority vote of all the disinterested directors, a majority
of whom shall constitute a quorum, or by a majority of the
members of a committee of two or more disinterested directors
appointed by vote; (ii) by special legal counsel selected in the
manner prescribed in the articles or organization and the
bylaws; (iii) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or
voted under the control of a director who at the time does not
qualify as a disinterested director may not be voted on the
determination. Independent may, in some circumstances,
advance expenses to a

Approval of Business
Combinations
  
The articles of incorporation of Meridian provide that any
action, including business combinations, will be valid and
effective upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the total number of shares of all classes of Meridian stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter.
  
The bylaws and articles of organization of Independent do not
contain any special provisions relating to the approval of
business combinations, and therefore business combinations
requiring a vote of Independent’s shareholders are subject to
the default rule under the Massachusetts Business
Corporation Act requiring the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.

For business to be brought before the 2022 annual meeting by a shareholder (other than a proposal submitted in accordance with Rule 14a-8), you must
give timely notice to Independent, which must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of Independent not less than 75
nor more than 125 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting (i.e., not later than March 6, 2022 or earlier than
January 15, 2022) and must otherwise satisfy the requirements set forth in Independent’s bylaws. In the event Independent receives notice of a
shareholder proposal to take action at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders that is not submitted for inclusion in Independent’s proxy materials, the
persons named in the proxy sent by Independent to its shareholders intend to exercise their discretion to vote on the shareholder proposal in accordance
with their best judgment. Please forward any shareholder proposals or notices of business, in writing, to Patricia M. Natale, Deputy General Counsel and
Corporate Secretary, Independent Bank Corp., 288 Union Street, Rockland, Massachusetts 02370.
Meridian
If you are interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in the proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders of Meridian, you need to
follow the procedures outlined in Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. Any stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal for inclusion in the proxy statement
for the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders will be required, pursuant to Rule 14a-8, to deliver the proposal to Meridian no later than December 10, 2021.
However, if the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders is held on a date more than 30 calendar days from May 16, 2019, a stockholder proposal must be
received by a reasonable time before Meridian begins to print and mail its proxy solicitation for such annual meeting..
Meridian’s bylaws provide that, in order for a stockholder to make proposals for business to be brought before the annual meeting, a stockholder must
deliver notice of such proposal(s) to the Secretary not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary of the prior year’s annual
meeting of stockholders. For the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, the notice would have to be received between November 10,
2021 and December 10, 2021. If the 2022 annual meeting is held on a date more than 30 calendar days from May 19, 2022, a Meridian stockholder’s notice
must be received not later than the close of business on the 10th calendar day following the day on which notice of the date of the scheduled annual
meeting is publicly disclosed. The stockholder must also provide certain information in the notice, as set forth in the Company’s
Bylaws. Failure to comply with these advance notice requirements will preclude such nominations or new business from being considered at the meeting.

and qualified or until their respective earlier death, resignation or removal from office.
Section 1.06 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger and the Holdco Merger, taken together, shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and relevant Treasury Regulations, and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a “plan of
reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and relevant Treasury Regulations. From and after the date of this Agreement and until
the Closing, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the Holdco Merger, taken together, and the Bank Merger each to
qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall refrain from taking or failing to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to cause the Merger and the Holdco Merger, taken together, and the Bank Merger each to fail to so qualify.
Section 1.07 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Buyer shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents,
assignments, or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Buyer its right,
title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties, or assets of Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver
all deeds, assignments, documents, or assurances in Law and to perform any other acts as are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect, or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in Buyer its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties, or assets of Company or (b) otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of Buyer are authorized in the name of Company or otherwise to take any and all additional
actions they deem necessary or advisable.

(a) Each share of Buyer Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(d) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares described in

0.275 of a share (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Buyer Common Stock (the “Consideration”). The Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares paid
pursuant to Section 2.04 are sometimes referred to collectively as the “Merger Consideration.”

Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, Company or any stockholder of Company:

Section 2.05 Exchange Procedures.
(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, (i) Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article II or
evidence of shares in book entry form (“New Certificates”) and (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent cash equal to
the estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock (that cash and New Certificates, being referred to as the
“Exchange Fund”).
(b) As promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, and provided that
Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information that is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its
obligations, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who has not previously surrendered their Certificate of
Certificates, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration as provided for in this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of the Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange, as applicable, (i) a New
Certificate representing that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to which the former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to this Agreement, and/or (ii) a check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock
which the former holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.05(b), each Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares described in
Section 2.01(c)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender the Merger Consideration as
provided for in this Agreement and any unpaid dividends and distributions as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 2.05 and any unpaid dividend
with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date that is prior to the Effective Time. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu
of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. For shares of Company Common Stock held in book
entry form, Buyer shall establish procedures for delivery which shall be reasonably acceptable to Company.
(c) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder shall surrender his or her Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.05. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.05, the record holder shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions, without any interest,
which had become payable with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by the Certificate. None of Buyer, Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect to them) or cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered, as required by Law, to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law.
(d) The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and a New Certificate or New Certificates
representing shares of Buyer Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until
such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.05, or
an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and a bond in such amount as shall be required in each case by Buyer (but not more than the
amount required under Buyer’s contract with its transfer agent). If any New Certificates evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person
 
A-5
Table of Contents
requesting the exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other recordation Tax required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate for
shares of Buyer Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that any Tax has been paid or is not payable.
(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time (as well as any interest or proceeds from any investment of the Exchange Fund) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any
stockholders of Company who have not complied with Section 2.05(b) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock the stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without
any interest. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date
on which such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the
unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable Law, become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not
in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to the property. Neither the Exchange
Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate for any
consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
specified in this Agreement, which books shall be deemed conclusive. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company
Common Stock represented by any Certificate, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of competent
jurisdiction any Merger Consideration represented by the Certificate and file legal proceedings interpleading all parties to such dispute, and will thereafter
be relieved with respect to any claims.
(f) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock any amounts as Buyer (or any
other applicable withholding agent) is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock for whom the deduction and withholding was made by
Buyer (or any other applicable withholding agent).
Section 2.06 Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the
exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately and appropriately adjusted so as to provide the holders of the Company Common Stock the same economic benefit as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to that event; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, no adjustment shall be made with regard to Buyer Common Stock if
(i) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer Common Stock and receives consideration for such shares (including, without limitation, upon the exercise of
outstanding stock options or other equity awards) or (ii) Buyer issues employee or director stock grants or similar equity awards pursuant to a Buyer
Benefit Plan.
Section 2.07 Options and Restricted Stock.
(a) Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (each sometimes referred to as an “Option,” and collectively sometimes referred to as
the “Options”) granted under the Company’s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan and 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Company Equity Plans”), whether vested
or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not been exercised or canceled prior thereto shall, at the
Effective Time, fully vest (to the extent not vested) and be canceled and, on the Closing Date, Company or Company Bank shall pay to the holder thereof
cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
 
A-6
Table of Contents
of Company Common Stock provided for in each such Option, and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration over (y) the
Exercise Price (the “Cash Payment”). Any Option for which the Exercise Price exceeds the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration shall be cancelled as
of the Effective Time without payment. For purposes of this Section 2.07(a), “Exercise Price” shall mean the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock provided for with respect to such Option. The Cash Payment shall be paid in cash within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, shall be
made without interest and shall be less applicable tax withholdings. Company shall prohibit the exercise of any Option beginning on and after the fifth
(5th) trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date.
(b) Each award in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions granted under a
Company Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Restricted Stock Award”) shall automatically vest in full at
the Effective Time and shall be considered outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. The Buyer shall issue the
consideration described in this Section 2.07(b), less applicable tax withholdings, within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date.
(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Company, the board of directors of Company and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary for the treatment of the Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards and to effectuate
the provisions of this Section 2.07.
Section 2.08 No Dissenters’ Rights. Consistent with the relevant provisions of the MGCL and Company’s Articles of Incorporation, no stockholder
of Company shall have appraisal rights with respect to the Merger.

(b) All Company Benefit Plans are in compliance in form and operation with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each
Company Benefit Plan which is an “employee pension benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a “Company Pension Plan”) and which
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS that is currently in
effect, and no circumstance exists that could result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of the qualification of the
Company Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. There is no pending or, to Company’s Knowledge, threatened litigation relating to the Company
Benefit Plans. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in, or is aware of, a transaction with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of the transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement, could subject Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated “single employer plan,” within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA (including any multiple employer
plan as described in 29 C.F.R. Section 4001.2), currently or formerly maintained or contributed to by Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any entity which
is considered one employer with Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an “ERISA Affiliate”).
Neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to (or been obligated to contribute to) a “multiemployer plan” within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA at any time during the six (6)-year period ending on the Closing Date, and neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred, and does not expect to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a “reportable event,” within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
thirty (30)-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any Company Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within
the thirty six (36)-month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.
(d) All contributions required to be made with respect to all Company Benefit Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the
financial statements of Company to the extent required by GAAP. No Company Pension Plan or single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an
“accumulated funding deficiency” (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or has otherwise failed
to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or Sections 302 and 303 of ERISA, and none of Company or any ERISA Affiliate
has an outstanding funding waiver. No Company Benefit Plan is considered to be an “at-risk” plan within the meaning of Section 430 of the Code or
Section 303 of ERISA.
(e) Other than as set forth on Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(e), neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health or life benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, other than coverage as may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I
of ERISA, or under the continuation of coverage provisions of the Laws of any state or locality. All Company Benefit Plans that are group health plans
have been operated in compliance with the group health plan continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601-609 of ERISA, the
certification of prior coverage and other requirements of Sections 701-702 and 711-713 of ERISA and the terms and conditions of the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act. Company may amend or terminate any such Company Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder, other
than routine administrative costs.
(f) Other than as set forth on Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16 or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the execution of this
Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement or consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any
Company Employee to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of this Agreement under any
Company Benefit Plans, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger

Company Benefit Plans, (iv) result in any payment under any Company Benefit Plans that would be a “parachute payment” as defined in Section 280G of
the Code, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the future, (v) limit
or restrict the right of Company or Company Bank or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, to merge, amend, or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans, (vi) result in payments under any of the Company Benefit Plans which
would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code, or (vii) result in any accounting accruals under any Company Benefit Plans
not in the ordinary course of business.
(g) No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code. Other than as set forth
on Company Disclosure Schedule 3.13(c) or Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(f), the execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of this
Agreement or consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not constitute a change in control, as such term is defined
under any applicable Company Benefit Plan.
(h) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation plan is in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
applicable. All elections made with respect to compensation deferred under an arrangement subject to Section 409A of the Code have been made in
accordance with the requirements of Section 409(a)(4) of the Code, to the extent applicable. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has taken any
action, or has failed to take any action, that has resulted or could result in the interest and tax penalties specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code
being owed by any participant in a Company Benefit Plan or (ii) has agreed to reimburse or indemnify any participant or beneficiary in a Company Benefit
Plan for any income taxes or the interest or penalties that may be payable as a result of Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code that may be currently due or
triggered in the future.
(i) Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(i) sets forth the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified on such Schedule, whether
individually or in the aggregate (including good faith estimates of all amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date of this Agreement, such
as tax indemnification payments in respect of income or excise taxes), under any employment, change-in-control, severance or similar contract, plan or
arrangement with or which covers any present or former director, officer or employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries who may be entitled to any
amount and identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits due under any Company Benefit Plans (other than a plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code or under the Company Employee Severance Compensation Plan) for each such person, specifying the assumptions in such
schedule and providing estimates of other required contributions to any trusts for any related fees or expenses.
(j) To Company’s Knowledge, Company and its Subsidiaries have correctly classified all individuals who directly or indirectly perform
services for Company or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of each Company Benefit Plan, ERISA, the Code, tax withholding, unemployment
compensation Laws, workers’ compensation Laws and all other applicable Laws.
(k) Each Option (A) was granted in compliance with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the applicable plan pursuant
to which it was issued, (B) has an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the date
of such grant (as determined pursuant to the applicable Company Equity Plan), (C) has a grant date identical to the date on which Company’s board of
directors or compensation committee actually awarded it, and (D) qualifies for the tax and accounting treatment afforded to such award in Company’s tax
returns and Company’s financial statements, respectively.
(l) Except as described in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(l), Company maintains no split dollar life insurance for the benefit of any
current or former executive, employee director or other service provider (the “Split Dollar Policies”). Company has previously provided a true and

vesting or limitations on termination of any such policy, in connection with a change in control or termination of service.

in each case, to the extent applicable.

Benefit Plan which is an “employee pension benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a “Buyer Pension Plan”) and which is intended to

to be incurred by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated “single employer plan,” within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA (including any multiple employer plan as described in 29 C.F.R. Section 4001.2), currently or formerly maintained or
contributed to by Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate. Neither Buyer nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to (or been obligated to
contribute to) a “multiemployer plan” within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA at any time during the six-year period ending on the Closing Date, and
neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, and does not expect to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a “reportable event,” within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any Buyer Pension Plan or by
any ERISA Affiliate within the 36 month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.
(d) All contributions required to be made with respect to all Buyer Benefit Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the
financial statements of Buyer to the extent required by GAAP. No Buyer Pension Plan or single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an “accumulated
funding deficiency” (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or has otherwise failed to satisfy the
minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or Sections 302 and 303 of ERISA, and none of Buyer or any ERISA Affiliate has an
outstanding funding waiver. No Buyer Benefit Plan is considered to be an “at-risk” plan within the meaning of Section 430 of the Code or Section 303 of
ERISA.

Recommendation Change, except in accordance with this Section 5.04. Company shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Buyer to assist in
the solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating to the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval. However, subject to Section 7.01 and Section 7.02,
if the board of directors of Company, in response to (1) a Company Intervening Event or (2) a Company Superior Proposal, in each case, after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial

advisor, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to
recommend this Agreement and the Merger, then, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, in submitting this Agreement and
the Merger to its stockholders, the board of directors of Company may withhold or withdraw or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Buyer the
Company Board Recommendation or may submit this Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders without recommendation (each, a “Company
Adverse Recommendation Change”) (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the board of directors of Company may communicate the basis for its Company Adverse Recommendation Change to its stockholders,
including in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto; provided, that the board of directors of Company
may not take any actions under this sentence (including effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) unless (i) it gives Buyer at least four
(4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken by the board of directors of Company in response to a Company Superior
Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Company Superior Proposal, or any amendment or
modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the board of directors of
Company takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Buyer and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be reasonably likely to result in a violation
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement and the Merger. Any material amendment to any Company
Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new Company Superior Proposal for purposes of this Section 5.04(a) and will require a new notice period as
referred to in this Section 5.04(a). Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to convene the Company Meeting as soon as practicable after
the Registration Statement becomes effective. Except with the prior approval of Buyer or as required by applicable Law, no other matters shall be
submitted for the approval of Company stockholders at the Company Meeting. Except in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.04(a), Company’s
board of directors shall at all times prior to and during the Company Meeting recommend approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of Company
and shall not withhold, withdraw, amend, or modify their recommendation in any manner adverse to Buyer or take any other action or make any other
public statement inconsistent with their recommendation. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, Company shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders for their consideration at the Company Meeting and nothing in this Agreement shall relieve Company of the obligation to
do so. In the event that there is present at the Company Meeting, in person or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the Requisite
Company Stockholder Approval, Company will not adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting unless Company is advised by counsel that failure to do
so would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of the U.S. federal securities Laws or fiduciary duties of Company’s board of directors. Company shall
keep Buyer updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results in connection with the Company Meeting as reasonably requested by Buyer. Company
shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on
the date of such meeting, Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company
Stockholder Approval. Company shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting two (2) times, for aggregate adjournments or
postponements not exceeding sixty (60) calendar days, pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 5.04(a) and any further
adjournments or postponements of the Company Meeting shall require the prior written consent of Buyer.
(b) Buyer agrees to take, in accordance with applicable Law, the Articles of Organization of Buyer and the Bylaws of Buyer, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders to consider and vote upon the approval of the Buyer Share Issuance and any other matters required
to be approved by Buyer’s shareholders in order to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
adjournment or postponement, the “Buyer Meeting”) and, except in the case of a Buyer Adverse Recommendation Change, shall take all lawful action to
solicit shareholder approval, including by communicating to its shareholders its

recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus) that they approve the Buyer Share Issuance (the “Buyer
Board Recommendation”), and shall not make a Buyer Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with this Section 5.04(b). Buyer shall
engage a proxy solicitor to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Requisite Buyer Shareholder Approval. However, subject
to Section 7.01 and Section 7.02, if the board of directors of Buyer, in response to (1) a Buyer Intervening Event or (2) a Buyer Superior Proposal, in each
case, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend the Buyer Share Issuance, then, prior to
the receipt of the Requisite Buyer Shareholder Approval, in submitting the Buyer Share Issuance to its shareholders, the board of directors of Buyer may
withhold or withdraw or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Company the Buyer Board Recommendation or may submit the Buyer Share Issuance to
its shareholders without recommendation (each, a “Buyer Adverse Recommendation Change”) (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of
the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the board of directors of Buyer may communicate the basis for its Buyer Adverse
Recommendation Change to its shareholders including in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto;
provided, that the board of directors of Buyer may not take any actions under this sentence (including effecting a Buyer Adverse Recommendation
Change) unless (i) it gives Company at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description
of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the board of directors of Buyer
takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Company and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and,
with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend the Buyer Share Issuance. Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
convene the Buyer Meeting as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement has been declared effective. Except with the prior approval of
Company or as required by applicable Law, no other matters shall be submitted for the approval of Buyer shareholders at the Buyer Meeting. Except in
accordance with the terms of this Section 5.04(b), Buyer’s board of directors shall at all times prior to and during the Buyer Meeting recommend approval
of this Agreement by the shareholders of Buyer and shall not withhold, withdraw, amend, or modify their recommendation in any manner adverse to
Company or take any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with their recommendation. Notwithstanding any Buyer Adverse
Recommendation Change, Buyer shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders for their consideration at the Buyer Meeting and nothing in this
Agreement shall relieve Buyer of the obligation to do so. In the event that there is present at the Buyer Meeting, in person or by proxy, sufficient
favorable voting power to secure the Requisite Buyer Shareholder Approval, Buyer will not adjourn or postpone the Buyer Meeting unless Company has
adjourned or postponed the Company Meeting or Buyer is advised by counsel that failure to do so would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of the
U.S. federal securities Laws or fiduciary duties of Buyer’s board of directors. Buyer shall keep Company updated with respect to the proxy solicitation
results in connection with the Buyer Meeting as reasonably requested by Company. Buyer shall adjourn or postpone the Buyer Meeting, if, as of the time
for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Buyer Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, Buyer has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Buyer Shareholder Approval. Buyer shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the
Buyer Meeting two (2) times, for aggregate adjournments or postponements not exceeding sixty (60) calendar days, pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence of this Section 5.04(b) and any further adjournments or postponements of the Buyer Meeting shall require the prior written consent
of Company.
(c) Each of Buyer and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Buyer Meeting and the Company Meeting to occur as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement has been declared effective and on the same date, with the Company Meeting occurring
prior to the Buyer Meeting.

(a) Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease, and Company and its Subsidiaries shall cause each of their respective
representatives to immediately cease, any discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal. Except as permitted by this Section 5.09, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiry with respect to, (ii) participate or engage in any negotiations with any Person with, or furnish any
nonpublic information relating to, or (iii) engage or participate in any discussions with any Person regarding, a Company Acquisition Proposal, except to
notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.09; provided, that, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder
Approval, in the event Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its
and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that its board of directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor) that such Company Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal and failure to take
such actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, further, that, prior to or
concurrently with providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Company shall have provided such
information to Buyer, and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Company. Company will promptly
(and in any event within one (1) Business Day) advise Buyer following receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the
identity of the person making such inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal and, if applicable, copies of any documents or correspondence evidencing
such Company Acquisition Proposal) and will keep Buyer reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current
basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal. Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable Law and the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Company, to enforce any existing confidentiality or
standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.
(b) Except as set forth in Section 5.04(a), the board of directors of Company shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, or modify (or publicly propose
to withhold, withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Buyer, its recommendation referred to in Section 5.04, or (ii) approve or recommend (or publicly
propose to approve or recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal. Company shall not, its board of directors shall not allow Company to, and
Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other agreement (except for confidentiality agreements referred to and entered into in
accordance with the terms of Section 5.09(a)) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal.
(c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 shall prohibit Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or
state law with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal, including Rule 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or, (ii) making any
disclosure to Company’s stockholders if, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, Company determines that such disclosure would be required
under applicable Law; provided, however, that any such disclosure relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change unless it is limited to a stop, look, and listen communication or Company’s board of directors reaffirms the
recommendation referred to in Section 5.04 in such disclosure and does not recommend that Company stockholders tender their shares or otherwise
support such Company Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.09.

Section 5.10 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director
or officer of Company and its Subsidiaries (the “Indemnified Parties”) and any person who becomes an Indemnified Party between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred after the Effective Time in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, based in whole or in part, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director or
officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee,
trustee or other agent of any other organization or in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of Company, including without limitation
any matters arising in connection with or related to the negotiation, execution, and performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions it
contemplates, to the full extent to which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled to have the right to be indemnified under the Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws of Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement as though such Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws continue to remain in effect after
the Effective Time and as permitted by applicable Law. Buyer shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to
each Indemnified Party to the full extent as would have been permitted by Company under the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, upon receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advance payments if such officer, director or employee shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to indemnification
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. Buyer’s obligations under this Section 5.10(a) shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim; and provided further, that Buyer’s obligations as successor in interest to the Company shall
continue as required under the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company.
(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the Indemnifying Party and, if so, only to the extent of such
actual prejudice. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense, except that if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party is prohibited by applicable Laws and regulations.
(c) Prior to the Closing, Company shall and if Company is unable to, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time to
obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Company’s
current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) with terms, conditions, retentions, and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable to the
 
A-50
Table of Contents
Indemnified Parties as Company’s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect,
breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity
that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions it contemplates);
provided, however, that in no event shall Company expend, or Buyer or the Surviving Entity be required to expend, for such “tail” policy in the aggregate
a premium amount in excess of an amount (the “Maximum D&O Tail Premium”) equal to 200% of the annual premiums paid by Company for D&O
Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement; provided further, that if the cost of such a tail policy exceeds the Maximum D&O Tail Premium,
Company, Buyer or the Surviving Entity shall obtain a tail policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding Maximum D&O Tail
Premium.
(d) If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.
(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive, or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to Company or its officers, directors and employees, and that the
indemnification of this Section 5.10 is not a substitute for any claims under any policies.
(f) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 5.10 are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with
Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1828(k)) and the regulations promulgated by the FDIC (12 C.F.R. Part 359).
Section 5.11 Employees; Benefit Plans.
(a) All Company Employees who remain employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be subject to Buyer
Bank’s normal and customary employment procedures and practices, including customary background screening and evaluation procedures, and
satisfactory employment performance. In addition, Company and Company Bank agree, upon Buyer’s reasonable request, to facilitate discussions
between Buyer and Company Employees regarding employment, consulting, or other arrangements to be effective prior to or following the Merger. Any
interaction between Buyer and Company Employees shall be coordinated by Company.
(b) Company Employees (other than those who are parties to an employment, change of control, or other type of agreement which provides
for severance) as of the date of this Agreement who remain employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and whose
employment is terminated by Buyer (absent termination for cause as determined by the employer) within one year after the Effective Time shall, subject to
the execution by each Company Employee of a standard release, substantially in the form set forth in Buyer Disclosure Schedule 5.11(b), in favor of Buyer
and Buyer Bank (if Buyer, in its discretion, requests that a release be signed), receive severance pay in a lump sum equal to the greater of the amount
determined under (i) the East Boston Savings Bank Amended and Restated Employee Severance Compensation Plan as set forth in Company Disclosure
Schedule 5.11(b), or (ii) eight weeks of base compensation.
(c) Following the Closing Date, Buyer may choose to maintain any or all of the other Company Benefit Plans in its sole discretion, subject to
the next sentence of this Section 5.11(c). For any Company Benefit Plan terminated for which there is a comparable Buyer Benefit Plan of general
applicability, Company Employees shall be entitled to participate in the Buyer Benefit Plan to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Buyer or
Buyer Bank (it being understood that inclusion of Company Employees in Buyer Benefit Plans may occur, if at all, at different times with respect to
different plans). With respect to a comparable Buyer Benefit Plan, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits,
and vacation
 
A-51
Table of Contents
entitlement (but not for accrual of benefits under any Buyer Benefit Plans, including any post-retirement welfare benefit plan of Buyer, but excluding any
severance, vacation and/or paid time off plans), service by a Company Employee shall be recognized to the same extent such service was recognized
immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Plan in which such Company Employee was a participant immediately before the Effective
Time, or if there is no such comparable employee benefit plan, to the same extent such service was recognized under the Company 401(k) plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time to the extent applicable; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no coverage of any Company Employees who remain employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time or their dependents shall terminate under any of the Company’s health care plans prior to the time such employees or their
dependents, as applicable, become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to similarly situated employees of Buyer and
Buyer Bank and their dependents and, consequently, no such employees shall experience a gap in health care benefit coverage. If employees of Company
or any of its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental, or health plan of Buyer or Buyer Bank upon termination of a similar plan of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall cause each plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are
covered under the applicable medical, health, or dental plans of Buyer or Buyer Bank, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide full credit under
such plans for any deductible, co-payment, and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the plan
year prior to participation, and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
which would otherwise be applicable to the employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent the employee had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.
(e) Buyer shall honor, and the Surviving Entity shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all vested benefit
obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees and directors of Company existing as of the Effective Time, as well as all
employment, severance, deferred compensation, retirement or “change-in-control” agreements, plans, or policies of Company, but only if such
obligations, rights, agreements, plans or policies, that individually or in the aggregate are material, are set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Buyer acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a “change-in-control” of Company for purposes of any benefit plans,
agreements, and arrangements of Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of Buyer or Buyer Bank to amend or terminate any of the
Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time after the Effective Time, subject to vested rights of employees
and directors that may not be terminated pursuant to the terms of the Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans.
(f) In the event that Buyer or Buyer Bank terminates or lays off a sufficient number of employees following the Effective Date to trigger a
notice requirement under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar applicable Law (“WARN Act”) with respect to
(i) Company Employees employed during the 90-day period preceding the Effective Time, and (ii) Company Employees employed by Buyer or Buyer Bank
after the Effective Time, Buyer shall be solely responsible for compliance with, and any liabilities incurred pursuant to, the WARN Act. Company and
Company Bank shall cooperate in providing information reasonably requested by Buyer that is necessary for Buyer to prepare and distribute notices that
Buyer may desire to provide prior to the Effective Time under the WARN Act.
(g) Company and Company Bank shall take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary to effect the actions set forth below
relating to the ESOP and ESOP Loan. At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and no more than seven Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the ESOP shall be terminated (the “ESOP Termination Date”). No new participants shall be admitted on or after the ESOP Termination Date and all
ESOP participants’ accounts shall become fully vested and 100% non-forfeitable. On the ESOP Termination Date, Company Bank shall direct the ESOP
trustee to remit a sufficient number of shares of
 
A-52
Table of Contents
Company Common Stock held in the ESOP Loan suspense account (the “Suspense Shares”) back to Company Bank to repay the outstanding ESOP Loan
in full. All remaining shares of Company Common Stock held by the ESOP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any unallocated shares
held in the ESOP Loan suspense account (which shall not include any shares of Company Common Stock used for purposes of repaying or forgiving the
ESOP Loans) shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Following the Effective Time, the unallocated shares of Buyer
Common Stock held in the ESOP Loan suspense account and any other remaining unallocated assets shall be deemed to be earnings and shall be
allocated as earnings to the accounts of the ESOP participants, whether or not such participant is actively employed by Company Bank on the ESOP
Termination Date, based on their account balances under the ESOP as of the ESOP Termination Date and distributed to ESOP participants after the receipt
of a favorable determination letter from the IRS (only if Buyer requests that Company and Company Bank file such determination letter request with the
IRS pursuant to this Section 5.11(g)), except as may be required by applicable Law or the terms of the ESOP. The ESOP shall be amended to provide that
distributions under the ESOP after the Closing shall be made only in the form of Buyer Common Stock except with respect to any fractional shares or
other de minimis cash distributions, which shall be distributed in the form of de minimus cash, or as otherwise required by applicable Law. If requested by
Buyer, prior to the Effective Time, Company and Company Bank, and following the Effective Time, Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith to commence the process to obtain such favorable determination letter (including, but not limited to, making such changes to the ESOP as may
be required by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). Company, Company Bank, and following the Effective Time,
Buyer, shall adopt such amendments to the ESOP and related trusts and resolutions to effect the provisions of this Section 5.11(g) (which amendments or
resolutions shall be provided to Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to adoption for Buyer’s review and approval).
(h) Nothing in this Section 5.11, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.11. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 5.11 shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director, or consultant of Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this Section 5.11 is intended (i) to amend any Company Benefit Plan or any Buyer Benefit Plan,
(ii) interfere with Buyer’s or the Surviving Entity’s right from and after the Closing Date to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Benefit
Plan or (iii) interfere with Buyer’s or the Surviving Entity’s right from and after the Effective Time to terminate the employment or provision of services by
any director, employee, independent contractor, or consultant.
(i) If Buyer terminates Company’s 401(k) plan prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to permit
Company 401(k) participants who are employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of such date to roll over any eligible rollover distributions in
Company’s 401(k) plan into Buyer’s 401(k) plan, excluding those related to plan loans under Company’s 401(k) plan.
Section 5.12 Notification of Certain Changes. Buyer and Company shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which
would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or which it believes would reasonably be expected to, cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time (and on the
date prior to the Closing Date), Buyer and Company will supplement or amend their respective Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the
execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
forth or described in such Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in such Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered
materially inaccurate. No supplement or amendment to the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or Company Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.02(a) or 6.03(a), or compliance by Buyer or Company with the respective
covenants and agreements.

Board of Directors
Meridian Bancorp, Inc.
67 Prospect Street
Peabody, MA 01960
Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Independent Bank Corp. (“Independent”), Bradford Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), Rockland Trust Company (“Rockland”),
Meridian Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) and East Boston Savings Bank (“EBSB”), propose to enter into the Agreement (defined below) pursuant to
which, among other things, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub, with the Company as the surviving entity, and then the Company will
be merged with and into Independent with Independent as the surviving entity (together, the “Merger”) and that, in connection with the Merger, each
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than the Exception Shares (as
defined below), shall become and be converted into the right to receive 0.275 of a share of Independent common stock (the “Exchange Ratio”). “Exception
Shares” shall mean each share of Company Common Stock (i) held as treasury stock or (ii) owned directly by Independent (other than, in the case of
clause (ii), shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously
contracted). The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has requested that Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (“Raymond James”) provide an
opinion (the “Opinion”) to the Board as to whether, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio to be received by the holders of the Company Common
Stock (other than the Exception Shares) in the Merger pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders. For purposes of
this Opinion, and with your consent, we have assumed that the there are approximately 52.4 million shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding and approximately 33.1 million shares of Independent common stock issued and outstanding.
In connection with our review of the proposed Merger and the preparation of this Opinion, we have, among other things:
 
 
1.
reviewed the financial terms and conditions as stated in the draft of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 21, 2021 (the
“Agreement”);
 
 
2.
reviewed certain information related to the historical condition and prospects of the Company and Independent, as made available to
Raymond James by or on behalf of the Company, including, but not limited to, (a) financial projections for each of the Company and
Independent that were prepared using consensus analyst estimates for the years 2021 and 2022 with further years extrapolated based on
appropriate growth rates, which were reviewed and approved for our use by the management of the Company (the “Projections”) and
(b) certain forecasts and estimates of potential cost savings, operating efficiencies, revenue effects, and other pro forma financial
adjustments expected to result from the Merger, as approved and directed for our use by management of the Company (the “Pro Forma
Financial Adjustments”);
 
 
3.
reviewed the Company’s and Independent’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and
unaudited financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2021;

deem to be relevant;

the current market prices of the publicly traded securities of certain other companies that we deemed to be relevant;
 
 
8.
conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as we deemed
appropriate;
 
 
9.
received a certificate addressed to Raymond James from a member of senior management of the Company regarding, among other things,
the accuracy of the information, data and other materials (financial or otherwise) provided to, or discussed with, Raymond James by or on
behalf of the Company; and
 
 
10.
discussed with members of the senior management of the Company certain information relating to the aforementioned and any other matters
which we have deemed relevant to our inquiry including, but not limited to, the past and current business operations of the Company and
the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company.
With your consent, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us, and we have undertaken no duty or responsibility to, nor did we, independently verify any of such
information. Furthermore, we have undertaken no independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims
or other contingent liabilities, to which the Company or Independent is a party or may be subject, or of any governmental investigation of any possible
unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which the Company or Independent is a party or may be subject. With your consent, this Opinion
makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the potential effects of any such litigation, claims or investigations or possible
assertions. We have not made or obtained an independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or Independent.
With respect to the Projections, Pro Forma Financial Adjustments and any other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed
with us, we have, with your consent, assumed that the Projections, Pro Forma Financial Adjustments and such other information and data have been
reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting (or, in the case of the Projections with respect to 2021 and 2022, which were prepared using
consensus analyst estimates for the years 2021 and 2022, are consistent with) the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the
Company, and we have relied upon the Company to advise us promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be
updated during the period of our review. We express no opinion with respect to the Projections, Pro Forma Financial Adjustments or the assumptions on
which they are based. We have assumed that the final form of the Agreement will be substantially similar to the draft reviewed by us, and that the Merger
will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without waiver or amendment of any conditions thereto. Furthermore, we have
assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Agreement are true and correct
and that each

such party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement without being waived. We have relied
upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the Merger will be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable
international, federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory, and other consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the Merger will be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed or amendments, modifications or
waivers made that would have an effect on the Merger, Independent or the Company that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion.
Our opinion is based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions existing and disclosed to us as of April 21, 2021 and any
material change in such circumstances and conditions would require a reevaluation of this Opinion, which we are under no obligation to undertake. As
you are aware, the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and we express no opinion or view as to any potential
effects of such volatility on the Merger, the Company, or Independent and this Opinion does not purport to address potential developments in any such
markets. As you are aware, there is significant uncertainty as to the potential direct and indirect business, financial, legal, economic and social
implications and consequences of the spread of the coronavirus and associated illnesses and the actions and measures that countries, governments,
regulatory agencies, central banks, international financing and funding organizations, stock markets, businesses and individuals may take to address the
spread of the coronavirus and associated illnesses including, without limitation, those actions and measures pertaining to fiscal or monetary policies,
legal and regulatory matters and the credit, financial and stock markets (collectively, the “Pandemic Effects”). We express no opinion or view as to the
potential impact of the Pandemic Effects on our analysis, this Opinion, the Merger, the Company or Independent. We have relied upon and assumed,
without independent verification, that there has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or
prospects of the Company or Independent since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise,
provided to us that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion, and that there is no information or any facts that would make any of the information
reviewed by us incomplete or misleading in any material respect.
We express no opinion as to the underlying business decision to effect the Merger, the structure or tax consequences of the Merger or the availability or
advisability of any alternatives to the Merger. We provided advice to the Board with respect to the proposed Merger. We did not, however, recommend
any specific amount of consideration or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. We did not solicit
indications of interest with respect to a transaction involving the Company. This letter does not express any opinion as to the likely trading range of
Independent’s stock following the Merger, which may vary depending on numerous factors that generally impact the price of securities or on the financial
condition of Independent at that time. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to be received by the
holders of the Company Common Stock (other than the Exception Shares).
We express no opinion with respect to any other reasons, legal, business, or otherwise, that may support the decision of the Board to approve or
consummate the Merger. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation is intended by Raymond James on matters that require legal, accounting or
tax advice. It is assumed that such opinions, counsel or interpretations have been or will be obtained from the appropriate professional sources.
Furthermore, we have relied, with the consent of the Board, on the fact that the Company has been assisted by legal, accounting and tax advisors and we
have, with the consent of the Board, relied upon and assumed the

accuracy and completeness of the assessments by the Company and its advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters with respect to the Company
and the Merger, including, without limitation, that the Company and Independent’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
and that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We are not
experts in the evaluation of allowances for loan and lease losses and have not independently verified such allowances or reviewed or examined any
individual loan or credit files. We have assumed, with your consent, that the allowance for loan and lease losses (i) set forth in the financial statements of
the Company and Independent are adequate to cover such losses, (ii) will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined entity and (iii) comply fully
with applicable law, regulatory policy and sound banking practices as of the date of such financial statements.
In formulating our opinion, we have considered only what we understand to be the Exchange Ratio to be received by the holders of Company Common
Stock (other than the Exception Shares) as is described above and we did not consider and we express no opinion on the fairness of the amount or nature
of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons, whether relative to the
compensation received by the holders of the Company Common Stock (other than the Exception Shares) or otherwise. We have not been requested to
opine as to, and this Opinion does not express an opinion as to or otherwise address, among other things: (1) the fairness of the Merger to the holders of
any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company, or to any other party, except and only to the extent expressly set forth in the
last sentence of this Opinion or (2) the fairness of the Merger to any one class or group of the Company’s or any other party’s security holders or other
constituencies vis-à-vis any other class or group of the Company’s or such other party’s security holders or other constituents (including, without
limitation, the allocation of any consideration to be received in the Merger amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other
constituents). We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or Independent or the
ability of the Company or Independent to pay their respective obligations when they come due.
The delivery of this opinion was approved by an opinion committee of Raymond James.
Raymond James has been engaged to render financial advisory services to the Company in connection with the proposed Merger and will receive a fee
for such services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. Raymond James will also receive a fee upon the
delivery of this Opinion, which is not contingent upon the successful completion of the Merger or on the conclusion reached herein. In addition, the
Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
In the ordinary course of our business, Raymond James may trade in the securities of the Company and Independent for our own account or for the
accounts of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In the two years preceding the date of this
opinion letter, Raymond James has engaged in fixed income trading activity with Independent and/or certain of its affiliates, for which it has earned
income. Furthermore, Raymond James may provide investment banking, financial advisory and other financial services to the Company and/or
Independent or other participants in the Merger in the future, for which Raymond James may receive compensation.

April 22, 2021
The Board of Directors
Independent Bank Corp.
288 Union Street
Rockland, MA 02370
Members of the Board:
You have requested the opinion of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (“KBW” or “we”) as investment bankers as to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, to Independent Bank Corp. (“Independent”) of the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) in the proposed acquisition of Meridian Bancorp, Inc.
(“Meridian”) by Independent through the proposed merger of Bradford Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Independent (“Merger Sub”),
with and into Meridian with Meridian as the surviving company (such transaction, the “Merger” and, taken together with the subsequent merger of
Meridian with and into Independent (with Independent as the surviving company), the “Transaction”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the “Agreement”) to be entered into by and among Independent, Merger Sub, Rockland Trust Company, Meridian and East Boston Savings Bank.
Pursuant to the Agreement and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth therein, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement),
automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Independent, Merger Sub, Meridian or any stockholder of Meridian, each
share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Meridian (“Meridian Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares of Meridian Common Stock (i) held as treasury stock or (ii) owned directly by Independent (other than, in the case of clause (ii),
shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted)) will
be converted into the right to receive 0.275 of a share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Independent (“Independent Common Stock”). The
ratio of 0.275 of a share of Independent Common Stock for one share of Meridian Common Stock is referred to herein as the “Exchange Ratio.” The terms
and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
The Agreement further provides that, immediately following the Holdco Merger Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), East Boston Savings
Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meridian, will merge with and into Rockland Trust Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Independent, pursuant to
a separate plan of bank merger (such transaction, the “Bank Merger”).
KBW has acted as financial advisor to Independent and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of our investment banking
business, we are continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in connection with acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for various other purposes. As specialists in
the securities of banking companies, we have experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of banking enterprises. Further to certain existing sales and
trading relationships between Independent and each of KBW and a KBW broker-dealer affiliate, and otherwise in the ordinary course of KBW and its
affiliates’ broker-dealer businesses, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time purchase securities from, and sell securities to, Independent and
Meridian. In addition, as a market maker in securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or
equity securities of Independent or Meridian for its and their own respective accounts and for the accounts of its and their respective customers and
clients. We have acted

exclusively for the board of directors of Independent (the “Board”) in rendering this opinion and will receive a fee from Independent for our services. A
portion of our fee is payable upon the rendering of this opinion, and a significant portion is contingent upon the successful completion of the
Transaction. In addition, Independent has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
Other than in connection with the present engagement, in the past two years KBW has not provided investment banking or financial advisory
services to Independent. In the past two years, KBW has not provided investment banking or financial advisory services to Meridian. We may in the
future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Independent or Meridian and receive compensation for such services.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating condition of
Independent and Meridian and bearing upon the Transaction, including among other things, the following: (i) an execution version of the Agreement,
dated as of April 22, 2021; (ii) the audited financial statements and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 of
Independent; (iii) certain preliminary and unaudited quarterly financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of Independent (provided by
Independent); (iv) the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 of Meridian;
(v) certain preliminary and unaudited quarterly financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of Meridian (provided by Meridian); (vi) certain
regulatory filings of Independent and Meridian and their respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly reports on Form FRY-9C and call reports filed
with respect to each quarter during the three year period ended December 31, 2020; (vii) certain other interim reports and other communications of
Independent and Meridian to their respective shareholders or stockholders; and (viii) other financial information concerning the respective businesses
and operations of Independent and Meridian furnished to us by Independent and Meridian or which we were otherwise directed to use for purposes of
our analyses. Our consideration of financial information and other factors that we deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to our
analyses included, among others, the following: (i) the historical and current financial position and results of operations of Independent and Meridian;
(ii) the assets and liabilities of Independent and Meridian; (iii) the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the
banking industry; (iv) a comparison of certain financial and stock market information of Independent and Meridian with similar information for certain
other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded; (v) publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Independent and Meridian, as well as
assumed Independent long-term growth rates and financial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for periods beyond 2022 provided to us
by Independent management, all of which information was discussed with us by such management and used and relied upon by us at the direction of
such management and with the consent of the Board; and (vi) estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Transaction on Independent
(including, without limitation, the cost savings, related expenses and operating synergies expected to result or be derived from the Transaction) that were
prepared by, and provided to and discussed with us by, Independent management, and used and relied upon by us at the direction of such management
and with the consent of the Board. We have also performed such other studies and analyses as we considered appropriate and have taken into account
our assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and our experience in other transactions, as well as our experience in securities
valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. We have also participated in discussions held by the managements of Independent and
Meridian regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of their respective companies
and such other matters as we have deemed relevant to our inquiry.
In conducting our review and arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and
other information that was provided to us or that was publicly available

and we have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of any such information or assumed any responsibility or liability for such
verification, accuracy or completeness. We have relied upon Independent management as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly
available consensus “street estimates” of Independent and Meridian, the assumed Independent long-term growth rates, the financial and operating
forecasts and projections of Meridian for periods beyond 2022, and the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Transaction on
Independent (including, without limitation, the cost savings, related expenses and operating synergies expected to result or be derived from the
Transaction), all as referred to above (and the assumptions and bases for all such information), and we have assumed that all such information has been
reasonably prepared and represents, or in the case of the Independent and Meridian “street estimates” referred to above that such estimates are
consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of Independent management and that the forecasts, projections and estimates
reflected in such information will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently estimated.
It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of Independent and Meridian that was provided to us was not prepared with
the expectation of public disclosure and that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of
Independent and Meridian referred to above, is based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain (including, without limitation,
factors related to general economic and competitive conditions, and in particular, assumptions regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and,
accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. We have assumed, based on discussions with the
management of Independent and with the consent of the Board, that all such information provides a reasonable basis upon which we can form our
opinion, and we express no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. Among other things, such information has assumed
that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact, which has been assumed to be limited, on Independent and Meridian. We have
relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and do not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the
accuracy or completeness thereof.
We also have assumed that there have been no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or
prospects of either Independent or Meridian since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made available to us. We are not
experts in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and we have assumed, without independent verification
and with your consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for Independent and Meridian are adequate to cover such losses. In
rendering our opinion, we have not made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent
or otherwise) of Independent or Meridian, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor have we
examined any individual loan or credit files, nor did we evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of Independent or Meridian under any state
or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be
appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty and
should not be taken as our view of the actual value of any companies or assets.
We have assumed, in all respects material to our analyses, the following: (i) that the Transaction and any related transactions (including, without
limitation, the Bank Merger) will be completed substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement (the final terms of which we have
assumed will not differ in any respect material to our analyses from the execution version reviewed by us and referred to above), with no adjustments to
the Exchange Ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of Meridian Common

Stock; (ii) that the representations and warranties of each party in the Agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in the
Agreement are true and correct; (iii) that each party to the Agreement and all related documents will perform all of the covenants and agreements required
to be performed by such party under such documents; (iv) that there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary
regulatory or governmental approval for the Transaction or any related transactions and that all conditions to the completion of the Transaction and any
related transactions will be satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the Agreement or any of the related documents; and (v) that in the course of
obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the Transaction and any related transactions, no restrictions,
including any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse
effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of Independent, Meridian or the pro forma entity or the contemplated benefits of the
Transaction, including without limitation the cost savings, related expenses and operating synergies expected to result or be derived from the
Transaction. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have
further been advised by representatives of Independent that Independent has relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate
sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Independent, Meridian, the Transaction and any related
transaction and the Agreement. KBW has not provided advice with respect to any such matters.
This opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, of the Exchange Ratio in the Merger to Independent.
We express no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the Transaction or any term or aspect of any related transaction (including the Bank
Merger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction or any such related transaction, any consequences of the Transaction to
Independent, its shareholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, consulting, voting, support,
shareholder, charitable giving or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the Transaction, any
such related transaction, or otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based upon conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on the date hereof and the
information made available to us through the date hereof. As you are aware, there is currently widespread disruption, extraordinary uncertainty and
unusual volatility arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of evolving governmental interventions and non-interventions.
It is understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion reached in this opinion and that KBW does not have an obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address, and we express no view or opinion with respect to, (i) the underlying business decision of
Independent to engage in the Transaction or enter into the Agreement; (ii) the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives
that are, have been or may be available to or contemplated by Independent or the Board; (iii) any business, operational or other plans with respect to
Meridian or the pro forma entity that may be currently contemplated by Independent or the Board or that may be implemented by Independent or the
Board subsequent to the closing of the Transaction; (iv) the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of Independent’s officers,
directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to any compensation to the holders of Independent Common Stock or relative to the
Exchange Ratio; (v) the effect of the Transaction or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class
of securities of Independent, Meridian or any other party to any transaction contemplated by the Agreement; (vi) the actual value of Independent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger; (vii) the prices, trading range or volume at which Independent Common Stock or Meridian Common Stock will
trade following the public announcement of the Transaction or the prices, trading range or volume at which Independent Common Stock will trade
following the consummation

of the Merger; (viii) any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the Transaction or any other transaction contemplated
by the Agreement; or (ix) any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Independent, Meridian, any of their respective shareholders
or stockholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the Transaction or any related transaction (including the Bank Merger), including
whether or not the Transaction will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes.
This opinion is for the information of, and is directed to, the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial
terms of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board as to how it should vote on the Transaction or to any holder of
Independent Common Stock or any shareholder or stockholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the Transaction or any other
matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not any such shareholder or stockholder should enter into a voting, shareholders’,
affiliates’ or other agreement with respect to the Transaction or exercise any dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder or
stockholder.
This opinion has been reviewed and approved by our Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with our policies and procedures established
under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio in the Merger is fair, from a financial point
of view, to Independent.
