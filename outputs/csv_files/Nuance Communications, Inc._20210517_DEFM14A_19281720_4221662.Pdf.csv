Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which we refer to as the DGCL, on the closing date and at the
time at which the merger will become effective, which we refer to as the effective time, Sub will merge with and into
Nuance, with Nuance continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As a
result of the merger, Nuance will cease to be a publicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own
any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.

If the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other
reason, Nuance stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Nuance common stock. Instead, Nuance
will remain an independent public company, Nuance common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq
and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act, and
Nuance will continue to file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as

termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement -

If the merger is completed, at the effective time, and without any action on the part of the holder, each share of
Nuance common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of Nuance
common stock (i) held by Nuance as treasury stock, (ii) owned by Microsoft or Sub or any of their respective direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and (iii) held by stockholders who have neither voted in favor of adoption of
the merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who have properly and validly exercised their statutory
rights of appraisal in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case immediately
prior to the effective time), and certain equity awards, the treatment of which is described under the sections entitled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and
Executive Officers of Nuance in the Merger - Treatment of Equity Compensation” and “Terms of the Merger
Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Treatment of Equity Compensation” beginning on pages 49 and 60, respectively,
will be converted into the right to receive $56.00 per share in cash, without interest, which we refer to as the merger
consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. All shares, when so converted at the effective time into the right
to receive the merger consideration, will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist.
As described under the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Exchange and Payment Procedures”
beginning on page 62, at or promptly following the effective time, Microsoft will deposit or cause to be

deposited with a designated paying agent (as defined herein) a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient
in the aggregate for the payment of the merger consideration.
After the merger is completed, under the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, you will have the right to
receive the per share merger consideration, but you no longer will have any rights as a Nuance stockholder as a
result of the merger (except for the right to receive the per share merger consideration and except that stockholders
who properly exercise and perfect, and do not validly withdraw or subsequently lose, their demand for appraisal will
instead have such rights as granted by Section 262 of the DGCL, as described under the section entitled “Appraisal
Rights” beginning on page 80).",11,12
"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",The Special Meeting,"The Special Meeting (page 21)
Date, Time and Place
The special meeting of our stockholders, which we refer to as the special meeting, will be held on June 15, 2021, at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time.
Due to the public health impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and to support the well-being of our employees and
stockholders, Nuance will hold the special meeting virtually via the Internet at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NUAN2021SM. You will not be able to attend the special meeting physically in
person. For purposes of attendance at the special meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present in
person” or “in person” shall mean virtually present at the special meeting.
Purpose
At the special meeting, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 17, 2021, which we
refer to as the record date, to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
the adoption of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement
accompanying this notice, which we refer to as the merger proposal; and
•
the approval, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable
to the named executive officers of Nuance in connection with the merger, which we refer to as the merger-
related compensation proposal.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of Nuance common stock as of the close of
business on the record date. You will have one vote at the special meeting for each share of Nuance common stock
you owned as of the close of business on the record date.
Quorum
The holders of a majority of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special
meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum at the special meeting. As of the close of
business on May 14, 2021, there were 286,094,629 shares of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote. We expect that a similar number of shares of Nuance common stock will be issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote at the special meeting as of the close of business on the record date. If you submit a properly
executed proxy by mail, telephone or the Internet, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In addition,
abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted for
purposes of establishing a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman
of the meeting pursuant to the authority granted in Nuance’s bylaws until a quorum is obtained, subject to the terms
of the merger agreement.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Nuance common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is
required to approve the merger proposal, which we refer to as stockholder approval. This means that the proposal will
be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” that proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of the votes
that can be cast in respect of our outstanding shares of common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
3TABLE OF CONTENTS
The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Nuance common stock entitled to vote which
are present, in person or by proxy, and voting at the special meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to
approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the merger-related compensation proposal. This means that the
proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” that proposal is greater than 50% of the total number
of shares of Nuance common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, and vote at the special
meeting, provided a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the merger-
related compensation proposal.
Share Ownership of Nuance Directors and Executive Officers
As of the close of business on May 14, 2021, Nuance directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were
entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,616,022 shares of Nuance common stock (excluding any shares of Nuance
common stock that would be delivered upon exercise or conversion of stock options or other equity-based awards),
which represented approximately 0.6% of the outstanding shares of Nuance common stock on that date.
It is expected that Nuance’s directors and executive officers will vote all of their shares “FOR” the merger proposal
and “FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal, although none of them has entered into any agreement
requiring them to do so.
Voting of Proxies
Any Nuance stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by returning a signed
and dated proxy card by mail, in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or voting electronically over the Internet
or by telephone or may vote in person by appearing at the special meeting. If your shares are held in a brokerage
account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or similar organization, then you are the “beneficial owner” of shares
held in “street name,” and you should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your
shares of Nuance common stock using the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee. Under
applicable stock exchange rules, if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares,
your broker, bank or other nominee only has discretion to vote your shares on discretionary matters. Each of the
merger proposal and the merger-related compensation proposal are non-discretionary matters, and brokers, banks
and other nominees therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important
that you cast your vote or instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at
the special meeting by submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the
earlier submitted proxy, signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting
or attending the special meeting and voting in person. Proxies submitted electronically over the Internet or by
telephone must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on June 14, 2021. If you hold your shares of Nuance common
stock in “street name,” you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee for instructions regarding how to
change your vote.",12,13

meeting of the stockholders of Nuance and (iv) resolved to recommend that Nuance stockholders vote in favor of

Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.
Nuance retained Evercore Group L.L.C., which we refer to as Evercore, to act as its financial advisor in connection
with the merger. As part of this engagement, Nuance requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Nuance common stock. At a meeting of
the Nuance Board of Directors held on April 9, 2021, Evercore rendered to the Nuance Board of Directors its opinion
to the effect that, as of April 9, 2021 and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and
conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the merger consideration of $56.00 per share to be received by the
holders of Nuance common stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated April 9, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of
review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated
herein by reference. Nuance encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore’s opinion
was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Nuance Board of Directors (in its capacity as
such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to
the Nuance Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of
shares of Nuance common stock should vote or act in respect of the merger. Evercore’s opinion does not address the
relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to
Nuance, nor does it address the underlying business decision of Nuance to engage in the merger.

The merger is not conditioned on Microsoft’s ability to obtain financing. Microsoft has represented to Nuance that it
has available and will have available at the effective time the funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger
consideration, including (i) payments to Nuance’s stockholders of the amounts due under the merger agreement and
(ii) payments in respect of certain of Nuance’s outstanding equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement.

"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",Treatment of Equity Compensation,"Treatment of Equity Compensation (page 49)
Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Nuance common stock in the
form of stock options and stock units. Our executive officers hold restricted stock units, which we refer to as RSUs,
and performance stock units, which we refer to as PSUs, and our non-employee directors hold RSUs and deferred
stock units, which we refer to as DSUs. Our executive officers and non-employee directors do not hold stock options.
The merger agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity awards:
Stock Options
Each stock option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration for each share of Nuance common stock
that would have been issuable upon exercise of the option, less the exercise price of the option and any applicable
withholding taxes. If the exercise price of a stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the
option will be cancelled as of the effective time for no consideration.
Stock Units
•
Each award of stock units that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the effective time or that will
become vested by its terms at the effective time and, in each case, by its terms is to be settled upon the
occurrence of vesting or the effective time will, as of the effective time, be deemed to be vested and will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of
Nuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes.
5TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Each outstanding and unvested award of stock units will, as of the effective time, be converted into a
stock-based award of Microsoft, which we refer to as a Rollover RSU, as follows:
○
Each RSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that is subject to the same time-based vesting
schedule as the RSU.
○
Each PSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that, following the effective time, will vest based
solely on time at the conclusion of the original performance period of the PSU.
○
The number of shares of common stock of Microsoft subject to each Rollover RSU will be equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Nuance shares of common stock
subject to the corresponding RSU or PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by a
specified exchange ratio (see below). The number of Nuance shares of common stock subject to each
PSU immediately prior to the effective time will be determined based on (i) maximum performance, for
any PSU that was subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, and (ii) target
performance, for any PSU that was subject to financial and/or operational performance goals. For each
PSU that is subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, Nuance is currently
performing at a level that would result in maximum performance payout.
○
Notwithstanding the treatment of awards of outstanding and unvested stock units described above,
Microsoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and
converting an award into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of
Nuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes).
•
If the treatment described above of an award of stock units held by a non-U.S. employee would be
prohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the
applicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance), Microsoft will
provide compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have
been provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and as would
not result in the imposition of additional taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. This
compensation will be provided in the form of a cash payment (less any applicable taxes) or a new equity
award, as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance.
•
For purposes of the conversion of Nuance stock units described above, the “exchange ratio” is defined as
a fraction, the numerator of which is the merger consideration and the denominator of which is the volume
weighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts 0.00005 and above rounded
up) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the last
trading day immediately prior to the closing.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In accordance with the terms of Nuance’s Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer
to as the ESPP, no ESPP participant in the current offering period, which began on February 16, 2021, may increase his
or her payroll contribution rate or make separate non-payroll contributions, and no new participants may enroll in the
current offering period. In connection with the transaction with Microsoft, Nuance will take all actions necessary to
provide that:
•
if the closing occurs prior to August 13, 2021, which is the last day of the current offering period:
○
cause the current offering period to terminate no later than five business days prior to the closing
date;
○
make any pro-rata adjustments necessary to reflect the shortened offering period; and
○
cause the exercise (as of no later than one business day before the effective time) of each outstanding
purchase right and apply the funds credited to each participant’s payroll withholding account to the
purchase of whole shares of Nuance common stock;
•
provide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence; and
•
terminate the ESPP in its entirety, effective as of the effective time.

Nuance non-employee directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Nuance Board of Directors was aware of and considered these
interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and overseeing the
negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and in recommending that
the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Nuance.

Any shares of Nuance common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and as
to which the holders thereof have not voted in favor of the merger proposal and are entitled to demand and properly
demand appraisal of such shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the
effective time, have neither failed to perfect, nor effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL,
such shares we collectively refer to as the dissenting shares, will not be converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration, unless and until such holder will have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder’s right to appraisal
under the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, at which time such shares of Nuance common stock will be treated as if they
had been converted into the right to receive, as of the effective time, the merger consideration, less applicable tax
withholdings upon surrender of such certificates that formerly represented such shares of Nuance common stock,
and such Nuance common stock will not be deemed dissenting shares, and such holder thereof will cease to have
any other rights with respect to such Nuance common stock. Each holder of dissenting shares will only be entitled to
such consideration as may be due with respect to such dissenting shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to Nuance before the vote is taken
on the merger proposal, you must not submit a blank proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the merger proposal and you
must continue to hold the shares of Nuance common stock of record through the effective time. Your failure to follow
the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for
exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of
Nuance common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should
consult with your broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand
for appraisal by such broker, bank or other nominee. Stockholders should refer to the discussion under the section
entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 80 and the DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights

The exchange of Nuance common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. holder (as defined herein) of Nuance common stock who exchanges shares
of Nuance common stock for cash in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in such shares. If you are a non-U.S. holder, the merger generally will not result in tax to you under U.S. federal
income tax laws unless you have certain connections with the United States.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. This
description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it pertain to state, local or other tax
consequences. Consequently, you are urged to contact your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax
consequences to you of the merger.

statement captioned “Terms of the Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Other Offers”) and to request any person
who executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring Nuance to promptly
return or destroy any non-public information furnished by or on behalf of Nuance prior to the date of the merger
agreement.
Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the earlier
termination of the merger agreement), Nuance has agreed to not, and to not authorize or direct, as the case may be, its
subsidiaries and its and their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives
and advisors, whom we collectively refer to as “representatives,” to, among other things: (1) solicit, initiate, propose
or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal,
offer or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal (as defined under the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Other Offers”); (2) furnish or
otherwise provide access to any non-public information regarding, or to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or personnel of, Nuance or its subsidiaries to any person in connection with or with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an acquisition proposal or any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; (3)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to an acquisition proposal or with
respect to any inquiries from third parties relating to making a potential acquisition proposal; (4) approve, endorse or
recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal; (5) enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, expense reimbursement agreement, acquisition
agreement or other contract relating to an acquisition transaction (as defined under the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Terms of the Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Other Offers”); or (6) authorize or commit
to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, under certain circumstances prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by
Nuance stockholders, Nuance may furnish information to, and enter into negotiations or discussions with, a person
regarding a bona fide written acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach of Nuance’s non-solicitation
obligations under the merger agreement if the Nuance Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel that (1) such proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a superior proposal (as defined in “Terms of the Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Other Offers”); and (2)
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. For more information, see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “Terms of the Merger Agreement - No Solicitation of Other Offers.”
Nuance is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal unless it
complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with
Microsoft during a specified period. If Nuance terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior
proposal, it must pay a $515 million termination fee to Microsoft. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Terms of the Merger Agreement - The Recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors;
Company Board Recommendation Change.”

The Nuance Board of Directors may not withdraw its recommendation that Nuance stockholders adopt the merger
agreement or take certain similar actions other than, under certain circumstances, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Nuance Board of Directors pursuant to applicable law and complies with the provisions of the
merger agreement.
However, the Nuance Board of Directors cannot withdraw its recommendation that Nuance stockholders adopt the
merger agreement or take certain similar actions unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement,

The following questions and answers are intended to address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger,
the merger agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may
be important to you as a Nuance stockholder. We encourage you to read carefully the more detailed information
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement (including the merger agreement),
and the documents we incorporate by reference in this proxy statement. You may obtain the documents and
information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the
section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 87. The merger agreement is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein.
Q:
Why am I receiving these proxy materials?
A:
On April 11, 2021, Nuance entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of Sub, with and into
Nuance, with Nuance surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. In order to complete the
merger, Nuance stockholders must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. The approval of
this proposal by our stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section entitled
“Terms of the Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” beginning on page 73. The Nuance
Board of Directors is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of Nuance common
stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and to
approve the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements
thereof. This proxy statement includes information that we are required to provide to you under the rules of the
SEC and is designed to assist you in voting on the matters presented at the special meeting. Stockholders of
record as of the close of business on May 17, 2021, which we refer to as the record date, may attend the special
meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement.
Q:
What is included in the proxy materials?
A:
The proxy materials include the proxy statement and the annexes to the proxy statement, including the merger
agreement, and a proxy card or voting instruction form.
Q:
When and where is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will take place on June 15, 2021, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time. Due to the possible public health
impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and to support the well-being of our employees and stockholders, Nuance
will hold the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website. The virtual meeting will
provide stockholders with the same rights and opportunities to participate as they would have at a physical
meeting. You will not be able to attend the special meeting physically in person.
Q:
What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Nuance?
A:
The proposed merger is the acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft through the merger of Sub with and into
Nuance pursuant to the merger agreement. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by the
requisite number of shares of Nuance common stock and the other closing conditions under the merger
agreement have been satisfied or waived, Sub will merge with and into Nuance, with Nuance continuing as the
surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Nuance will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft
and you will no longer own shares of Nuance common stock. Nuance expects to delist its common stock from
Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the effective time and deregister its common stock under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. Thereafter, Nuance will no longer be a publicly traded
company.
Q:
What will I receive if the merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration of $56.00 in
cash, without interest and less applicable tax withholdings, for each share of Nuance common stock that you
own, unless you have properly exercised and perfected and not withdrawn your demand for, or
1
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
otherwise lost your, appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100
shares of Nuance common stock, you will receive $5,600.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes, in exchange for your shares of Nuance common stock. In no case will you own shares in the
surviving corporation.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
If your shares of Nuance common stock are registered in your name in the records of our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, which we refer to as AST, as of the close of business on the
record date, you are a “stockholder of record” for purposes of the special meeting and are eligible to attend and
vote. If you hold shares of our common stock indirectly through a broker, bank or similar institution, you are not
a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares in “street name” and the record owner of your shares is
your broker, bank or similar institution. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name are described
under the question “How do I vote my shares?” below.
Q:
How many votes do I have?
A:
You will have one vote for each share of Nuance common stock owned by you, as a stockholder of record or in
street name, as of the close of business on the record date.
Q:
May I attend the special meeting?
A:
Yes. Subject to the requirements described in this proxy statement, all Nuance stockholders as of the close of
business on the record date may attend the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting
website and complete a virtual ballot, whether or not you sign and return your proxy card. If you are a
stockholder of record, you will need your assigned 16-digit control number to vote shares electronically at the
special meeting. The control number can be found on the proxy card, voting instruction form, or other applicable
proxy notices.
To ensure that your shares will be represented at the special meeting, we encourage you to grant your proxy in
advance electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy
card), or sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope. If you
attend the special meeting and complete a virtual ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If
you held your shares in “street name,” because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares at the special meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other
nominee.
Q.
Will I be able to participate in the virtual meeting on the same basis as I would be able to participate in a
physical meeting?
A.
The virtual meeting format for the special meeting will enable full and equal participation by all of our
stockholders from any place in the world. We believe that holding the special meeting online will help support
the health and well-being of our stockholders and other participants at the special meeting as we navigate the
public health impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19).
We designed the format of the virtual meeting to ensure that our stockholders who attend our special meeting
will be afforded the same rights and opportunities to participate as they would at a meeting attended physically
and to enhance stockholder access, participation and communication through online tools.
Q.
What if during the check-in time or during the meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing the
virtual meeting website?
A.
If you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual meeting during the check-in or meeting time, please call
the technical support number that will be posted on the special meeting log in page. If there are any technical
issues in convening or hosting the meeting, we will promptly post information to our website, including
information on when the meeting will be reconvened.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
A:
You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
the adoption of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement
accompanying this notice; and
•
the approval, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable
to the named executive officers of Nuance in connection with the merger.
Q:
How does Nuance’s Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
A:
The Nuance Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote
•
“FOR” the merger proposal; and
•
“FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal.
The Nuance Board of Directors, after considering various factors described under the section entitled “Proposal
1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons
for the Merger” beginning on page 35 and after consultation with independent legal and financial advisors,
unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Nuance and its stockholders to enter into the merger
agreement and consummate the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein and
declared the merger agreement advisable; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by
Nuance, the performance by Nuance of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation
of the merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger
agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of Nuance and (iv) resolved to recommend
that Nuance stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement in accordance with the DGCL.
Q:
How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of Nuance common stock prior to
the date on which the transaction was announced?
A:
The per share merger consideration represents a premium of (i) approximately 22.9% to Nuance’s closing stock
price on April 9, 2021, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger, (ii) approximately 28.4% to
the volume weighted average stock price of Nuance common stock during the 30 days ended April 9, 2021 and
(iii) approximately 10.9% to the highest closing stock price of Nuance common stock during the 52-week period
ended April 9, 2021.
Q:
Will Nuance pay a quarterly dividend before the completion of the merger?
A:
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, from April 11, 2021 until the effective time, Nuance may not declare, set aside or pay any dividend or
other distribution (whether in cash, shares or property or any combination thereof) in respect of any shares of
capital stock or other equity or voting interest, or make any other actual, constructive or deemed distribution in
respect of the shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interest, without Microsoft’s prior written
consent. See the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Conduct of Business Pending the Merger”
beginning on page 65.
Q:
Does Microsoft have the financial resources to complete the merger?
A:
Yes. Microsoft has represented to Nuance in that it has available and will have available at the effective time the
funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger consideration, including (i) payments to Nuance’s stockholders of
the amounts due under the merger agreement and (ii) payments in respect of certain of Nuance’s outstanding
equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement.
For a more complete description of sources of funding for the merger and related costs, see “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Financing of the Merger” beginning on page 54.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement (including the merger
agreement), and the documents we refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
affects you. Then grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or complete, sign, date and
return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, so that your
shares can be voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting
instruction forms provided by your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q:
How do I vote my shares?
A:
For stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the special meeting and are a stockholder of record, you
may submit your proxy or cast your vote in any of four ways:
•
By Internet - If you have Internet access, you may submit your proxy by following the instructions
provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card. Proxies submitted via Internet must be received
by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021.
•
By Telephone - You can also submit your proxy by telephone by following the instructions provided with
your proxy materials and on your proxy card. Proxies submitted via telephone must be received by 11:59
p.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021.
•
By Mail - You may submit your proxy by completing the proxy card enclosed with those materials, signing
and dating it and returning it in the prepaid envelope we have provided.
•
By Virtual Ballot - You may attend the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting
website and complete a virtual ballot.
For holders in street name: If you hold your shares in street name and, therefore, are not a stockholder of
record, you will need to follow the specific voting instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other
similar institution. If you wish to vote your shares by virtual ballot at our special meeting, you must obtain a
valid proxy from your broker, bank or similar institution, granting you authorization to vote your shares.
If you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your
shares of Nuance common stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions.
Even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of
Nuance common stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a valid proxy to vote shares
which you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Nuance common stock by virtual ballot at the
special meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the special meeting and vote
by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
Q:
Can I change or revoke my proxy?
A:
For stockholders of record: Yes. A proxy may be changed or revoked at any time prior to the vote at the special
meeting by submitting a later-dated proxy (including a proxy submitted via the Internet or by telephone) or by
giving written notice to our Secretary at our principal executive offices. You may not change your vote over the
Internet or by telephone after 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021. You may also attend the special meeting
and vote your shares by virtual ballot.
For holders in street name: Yes. You must follow the specific voting instructions provided to you by your
broker, bank or other similar institution to change or revoke any instructions you have already provided to them.
Q:
How will my shares be voted if I do not provide specific instructions in the proxy card or voting instructions
form that I submit?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record and if you sign, date and return your proxy card but do not provide specific
voting instructions, your shares of Nuance common stock will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal and “FOR”
the merger-related compensation proposal.
If your shares are held in street name at a broker, bank or similar institution, your broker, bank or similar
institution may under certain circumstances vote your shares on “discretionary” matters if you do not timely
provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions provided by them. However, if you do not
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
provide timely instructions, your broker, bank or similar institution does not have the authority to vote on any
“non-discretionary” proposals at the special meeting and a “broker non-vote” would occur, as explained in the
following question and explanation.
Q:
What is “broker discretionary voting”?
A:
If you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank or other similar institution may be able to vote your
shares without your instructions depending on whether the matter being voted on is “discretionary” or “non-
discretionary.” Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary voting
authority with respect to any of the two proposals, if a beneficial owner of shares of Nuance common stock held
in street name does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to any of the
proposals, then those shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If
there are any broker non-votes, then such broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
merger proposal, but will not have any effect on the merger-related compensation proposal. Therefore, it is
important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
Q:
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the special meeting. What constitutes a
quorum?
A:
The holders of a majority of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special
meeting, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at the special meeting. As of the close of
business on May 14, 2021, there were 286,094,629 shares of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote. We expect that a similar number of shares of Nuance common stock will be issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting as of the close of business on the record date. If you
submit a properly executed proxy by mail, telephone or the Internet, you will be considered a part of the quorum.
In addition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be
counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the special meeting may be
adjourned by the chairman of the meeting pursuant to the authority granted in Nuance’s bylaws until a quorum
is obtained, subject to the terms of the merger agreement.
Q:
What is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the annual meeting?
A:
The merger proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Nuance common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the merger proposal. This means that the proposal will be
approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” that proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of the
votes that can be cast in respect of our outstanding shares of common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
The merger-related compensation proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares
of Nuance common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, and voting at the special
meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the
merger-related compensation proposal. This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of shares
voted “FOR” that proposal is greater than 50% of the shares of Nuance common stock entitled to vote which
are present, in person or by proxy, and vote at the special meeting, provided a quorum is present. Abstentions
and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the merger-related compensation proposal.
Q:
How can I obtain a proxy card or voting instruction form?
A:
If you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card or a voting instruction form, please follow the
applicable procedure below.
For stockholders of record: Please contact our proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, at (877) 750-0854
from the U.S. or Canada, or at +1 (412) 232-3651 from other locations.
For holders in street name: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar
institution.

Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the merger is completed, under the terms of the merger agreement, you will receive shortly thereafter
the letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificates or surrender your book-entry shares to
the paying agent in order to receive the cash payment of the merger consideration for each share of your
Nuance common stock represented by the stock certificates or book-entry shares. You should use the letter of
transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled upon completion
of the merger. Please do not send in your stock certificates now.
Q:
I do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the merger consideration for my shares of Nuance
common stock?
A:
If the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will
include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificates. This will include an
affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to
post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Nuance common stock after the close of business on
the record date but before the special meeting?
A:
The record date is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date the merger is expected to be
completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of Nuance common stock after the close of business on the record
date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the provision of a proxy) are made
between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies
Nuance in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share merger
consideration if the merger is completed to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of Nuance
common stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or
otherwise transfer your shares of Nuance common stock after the close of business on the record date, we
encourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or vote via the Internet or telephone.
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible and currently intend to complete the
merger during this calendar year. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger cannot be predicted
because the completion of the merger is subject to conditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement
by our stockholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other
reason, Nuance stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Nuance common stock. Instead,
Nuance will remain an independent public company, Nuance common stock will continue to be listed and traded
on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and Nuance will continue to file periodic reports with the
SEC.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under certain specified circumstances, Nuance will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee upon the
termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement -
Termination Fee” beginning on page 75.
Q:
Are there any other risks to me from the merger that I should consider?
A:
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the merger. See the section entitled
“Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 20.
Q:
Do any of Nuance’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Nuance
stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors with respect to the merger proposal,
you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, the interests of Nuance stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the
merger agreement, (ii) approving the merger agreement and the merger, and (iii) unanimously recommending that
the merger agreement be adopted by Nuance stockholders, the Nuance Board of Directors was aware of and
considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For a description of
the interests of our directors and executive officers in the merger, see “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement - The Merger - Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Nuance in the
Merger” beginning on page 50.
Q:
What happens if the merger-related compensation proposal is not approved?
A:
Approval of the merger-related compensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote
is an advisory vote and is not binding. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the
merger is completed, Nuance may still pay such compensation to its named executive officers in accordance with
the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one
brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you
hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, date, sign and return (or vote via the Internet or telephone
with respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
Q:
Who counts the votes?
A:
Votes are counted by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., which we refer to as Broadridge, and are then certified
by a representative of Broadridge appointed by the Nuance Board of Directors to serve as the inspector of
election at the special meeting.
Q:
Who may attend the special meeting?
A:
Nuance stockholders who held shares of Nuance common stock as of the close of business on May 17, 2021.
Q:
Who pays for the expenses of this proxy solicitation?
A:
Nuance will bear the entire cost of this proxy solicitation, including the preparation, printing, mailing and
distribution of these proxy materials. We may also reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing
stockholders who hold their shares in street name for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding proxy
materials to such stockholders. In addition, certain directors, officers and other employees, without additional
remuneration, may solicit proxies in person, or by telephone, facsimile, email and other methods of electronic
communication.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Where can I find the vote results after the special meeting?
A:
We are required to publish final vote results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four
business days after our special meeting. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 87.
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Nuance common stock for cash pursuant to
the merger?
A:
The exchange of Nuance common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. holder of Nuance common stock who exchanges shares of
Nuance common stock for cash in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a non-U.S. holder, the merger generally will not result in tax to you
under U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections with the United States.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, see “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”
beginning on page 54.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.
This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it pertain to state, local or other tax
consequences. Consequently, you are urged to contact your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax
consequences to you of the merger.
Q:
What will the holders of outstanding Nuance equity awards receive in the merger?
A:
For information regarding the treatment of Nuance’s outstanding equity awards, see the section entitled “Terms
of the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Treatment of Equity Compensation” beginning on page 60.
Q:
What will happen to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan?
A:
For information regarding the treatment of Nuance’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, see the section entitled
“Terms of the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Treatment of Equity Compensation - Employee Stock
Purchase Plan” beginning on page 61.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the merger agreement is adopted by Nuance’s stockholders, stockholders who do not vote (whether in person
or by proxy) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly exercise and perfect their
demand for appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of Nuance common stock are entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value”
of the shares of Nuance common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any,
as determined by the court, subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders who wish to
seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the
exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. Stockholders should refer to the
discussion under the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 80 and the DGCL requirements for
exercising appraisal rights reproduced and attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.

This proxy statement, and the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement, as well as information
included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain certain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the proposed transaction and business combination between Microsoft
and Nuance, including statements regarding financial projections, the benefits of the transaction, the anticipated
timing of the transaction and the products and markets of each company. These forward-looking statements generally
are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “predicts,” “budget,” “forecast,” “continue,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will
be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or
expressions). Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that
are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many
factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this proxy
statement, including but not limited to: (i) the risk that the transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at
all, which may adversely affect Nuance’s business and the price of the common stock of Nuance, (ii) the failure to
satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the transaction, including the adoption of the merger agreement by the
stockholders of Nuance and the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals, (iii) the occurrence of any
event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, including in
circumstances that would require Nuance to pay a termination fee or other expenses, (iv) the effect of the
announcement or pendency of the transaction on Nuance’s business relationships, operating results, and business
generally, (v) risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of Nuance and potential
difficulties in Nuance employee retention as a result of the transaction, (vi) risks related to diverting management’s
attention from Nuance’s ongoing business operations, and (vii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be
instituted against us or against Microsoft related to the merger agreement or the transaction.
In addition, please refer to the documents that Nuance files with the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K (see the
section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 87). These filings identify and address
other important risks and uncertainties that could cause events and results to differ materially from those contained
in the forward-looking statements set forth in this press release. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the
date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and Nuance
assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Nuance stockholders are advised, however, to
consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects as may be detailed in our other filings made from time to
time with the SEC.

Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 17, 2021 are entitled to notice of the special meeting
and to vote at the special meeting or at any adjournments or postponements thereof. A list of stockholders entitled to
vote at the special meeting will be available at the virtual meeting website during the special meeting.
A majority in voting power of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special
meeting, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at the special meeting. As of the close of business
on May 14, 2021, there were 286,094,629 shares of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote. We expect that a similar number of shares of Nuance common stock will be issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote at the special meeting as of the close of business on the record date. If you submit a properly executed proxy
by mail, telephone or the Internet, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In addition, abstentions will be
counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of establishing a
quorum. If a quorum is not present, the special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting pursuant to
the authority granted in Nuance’s bylaws until a quorum is obtained, subject to the terms of the merger agreement.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Nuance common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is
required to approve the merger proposal. This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of shares
voted “FOR” that proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of the votes that can be cast in respect of our
outstanding shares of common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the merger proposal.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Nuance common stock entitled to vote which
are present, in person or by proxy, and voting at the special meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to
approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the merger-related compensation proposal. This means that the
proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” that proposal is greater than 50% of the total number
of shares of Nuance common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, and vote at the special
meeting, provided a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the merger-
related compensation proposal.
Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee that are present in person or represented by
proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee is not instructed by the
beneficial owner of such shares on how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary
voting power on such proposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not
21TABLE OF CONTENTS
have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the two proposals, if a beneficial owner of shares of
Nuance common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee
with respect to any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting. If there are any broker non-votes, then such broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the merger proposal, but will have no effect on the merger-related compensation proposal.",30,31

As of the close of business on May 14, 2021, Nuance directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were
entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,616,022 shares of Nuance common stock (excluding any shares of Nuance
common stock that would be delivered upon exercise or conversion of stock options or other equity-based awards),
which represented approximately 0.6% of the outstanding shares of Nuance common stock on that date. It is
expected that Nuance’s directors and executive officers will vote all of their shares “FOR” the merger proposal and
“FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal, although none of them has entered into any agreement requiring
them to do so.

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, AST, you may cause your shares to be voted by
returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or you may vote in person at
the special meeting. Additionally, you may submit electronically over the Internet or by phone a proxy authorizing the
voting of your shares by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card
available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically over the Internet or
by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares
according to your directions.
If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a virtual ballot at the meeting.
If your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special
meeting in person. If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by virtual ballot, your vote by virtual ballot
will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in
time for the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions of the
stockholder. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted (i) “FOR” the merger
proposal and (ii) “FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal. No proxy that is specifically marked against the
merger proposal will be voted in favor of the merger-related compensation, unless it is specifically marked “FOR” the
approval of such proposal.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may vote through your broker,
bank or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee,
or by the Internet or telephone through your broker, bank or other nominee if such a service is provided. To vote via
the Internet or telephone through your broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the
voting form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks
or other nominees have the discretion to vote your shares on discretionary matters if you fail to instruct your broker,
bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters. The merger proposal and the merger-
related compensation proposal are non-discretionary matters, and brokers, banks and other nominees therefore
cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. If you do not return your broker’s, bank’s or other
nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your broker, bank or other nominee, if
applicable, or do not attend the special meeting and vote in person with a proxy from your broker, bank or other
nominee, such actions will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the merger proposal but will not have
any effect on the merger-related compensation proposal.

delivering a written notice of revocation to our Secretary;

Please note that to be effective, your new proxy card, Internet or telephonic voting instructions or written notice of
revocation must be received by our Secretary prior to the special meeting and, in the case of Internet or telephonic
voting instructions, must be received before 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021. If you have submitted a proxy,
your appearance at the special meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an additional proxy or
revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.
If you hold your shares of Nuance common stock in “street name,” you should contact your broker, bank or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the special meeting if
you obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. Any adjournment of the special meeting for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies will allow Nuance stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to

If the merger proposal is approved by Nuance stockholders, stockholders who do not vote (whether in person or by
proxy) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly exercise and perfect their demand for
appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the
DGCL. This means that holders of Nuance common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Nuance
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,
together with interest to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court,
subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in
any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the
complexity of the appraisal process.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the $56.00 per share consideration payable
pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to Nuance before the vote is taken
on the merger proposal, you must not submit a blank proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the merger proposal and you
must continue to hold the shares of Nuance common stock of record through the effective time. Your failure to follow
the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for
exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL

This discussion of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached to
this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should read the entire
merger agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the merger.
Certain Effects of the Merger on Nuance
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, on the closing date and at the effective time, Sub will merge with and into Nuance, with
Nuance continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. Nuance expects to
delist its common stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the effective time and deregister its common
stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. Thereafter, Nuance will no longer be a
publicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving
corporation, and instead will only be entitled to receive the merger consideration, as described under the section
entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Common Stock” beginning on page 60.
The effective time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (or at such later time as Nuance, Microsoft and Sub may agree in writing and specify in the certificate of
merger).
Effect on Nuance if the Merger is Not Completed
If the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other
reason, Nuance stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Nuance common stock. Instead, Nuance
will remain an independent public company, Nuance common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq
and registered under the Exchange Act and Nuance will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Furthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be
consummated, it is likely that the price of Nuance common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is
uncertain when, if ever, the price of Nuance common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date
of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares of Nuance common stock. If the merger is not consummated, the
Board of Directors will continue to evaluate and review Nuance’s business operations, properties and capitalization,
among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder
value. If the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any
other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Nuance or its stockholders will be
offered or that Nuance’s business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.
Under certain specified circumstances, Nuance will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $515 million
upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled “Terms of the Merger
Agreement -Termination Fee” beginning on page 75.
Background of the Merger",35,35
"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
Mark Benjamin, Chief Executive Officer of Nuance, joined Nuance as Chief Executive Officer and a director on April
23, 2018. On the date prior to Mr. Benjamin’s appointment, the closing price of Nuance common stock was $14.91 per
share. Mr. Benjamin was charged by the Nuance Board of Directors with leading the planning and execution of a
strategic transformation of Nuance, with the goal of increasing shareholder value. In furtherance of that charge and in
keeping with the Nuance Board of Directors’ commitment to maximizing shareholder value, over the approximately
three-year period since Mr. Benjamin’s appointment, the Nuance Board of Directors and management have regularly
reviewed and discussed Nuance’s business strategy, performance and competitive position as well as various
strategic alternatives, including acquisitions, dispositions, commercial
26TABLE OF CONTENTS
partnerships and other strategic transactions. Since before Mr. Benjamin’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of
Nuance, Evercore Group L.L.C., which we refer to as Evercore, has rendered advice to Nuance regarding various
strategic and financial matters in support of these efforts by the Nuance Board of Directors.
Over the past three years, the Nuance Board of Directors have through these efforts directed a transformation of
Nuance’s business through a series of value-creating actions, including the sale of Nuance’s imaging business in
February 2019, the spin-off of Cerence, Nuance’s automotive business, in October 2019, and the sale of Nuance’s
Health Information Management Transcription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business
in March 2021, as well as share repurchases and debt reduction activities. Through these transactions and other
strategic initiatives, Nuance has streamlined its portfolio to focus on the healthcare and enterprise AI segments,
where the Nuance Board of Directors and management observed accelerated demand for advanced conversational AI
and ambient solutions.
In July 2019, a large private equity firm, which we refer to as Party A, contacted senior management of Nuance and
requested a meeting to discuss a potential acquisition of Nuance and requested that Nuance provide a form
nondisclosure agreement.
Also in July 2019, the chief executive officer of a global technology company, which we refer to as Party B, contacted
Mr. Benjamin and expressed interest in meeting to discuss conversational AI technologies, among other topics.
On July 22, 2019, Nuance and Party A signed a nondisclosure agreement. The nondisclosure agreement did not
contain a standstill provision.
On August 15, 2019, members of Nuance’s senior management met with representatives of Party A. The meeting
consisted of introductions of the Nuance and Party A teams and a high level discussion of Nuance’s business. Party
A made no proposal to acquire Nuance at that meeting and no immediate next steps were discussed. The closing
price of Nuance common stock on that date was $16.36 per share.
On August 21, 2019, Nuance and Party B amended an existing confidentiality agreement between the parties to,
among other matters, extend the expiration date of such agreement. The amended nondisclosure agreement did not
contain a standstill provision.
On August 23, 2019, executives of Party B and Nuance, including the chief executive officer of each company, met to
explore whether there could be mutually beneficial ways for the two companies to work together, including potentially
a strategic partnership or an acquisition of Nuance by Party B. Following this meeting, Party B informed Nuance that
it had elected not to proceed with further discussions regarding an acquisition transaction involving Nuance and
cited a lack of strategic fit with Party B. The closing price of Nuance common stock on that date was $16.99 per share.
Beginning prior to Mr. Benjamin’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of Nuance in April 2018 and through
October 2019, representatives of Nuance and representatives of Microsoft engaged in discussions regarding a
potential commercial partnership whereby Microsoft would become Nuance’s exclusive cloud provider and Nuance
and Microsoft would work together to develop and commercialize technology products and services for the
healthcare industry, including products that use AI technology.
healthcare industry, including products that use AI technology.
On October 1, 2019, Nuance completed the spin-off of Cerence that it had announced on November 19, 2018.
On October 9, 2019, Microsoft and Nuance formalized their strategic partnership by entering into a license and
collaboration agreement and an amendment to an existing cloud hosting agreement between the parties.
On October 17, 2019, at Party A’s request, representatives of Nuance and Party A spoke by telephone. Party A
advised the Nuance representatives that Party A would be interested in exploring an acquisition of Nuance and that it
believed it could offer a market-premium to Nuance’s then-current stock price of $15.75 if it could confirm a number of
assumptions with respect to Nuance’s business. Following that meeting, Party A provided Nuance with a due
diligence request list and proposed work plan that contemplated substantial engagement between the parties through
the end of the year.
Following receipt of Party A’s diligence request list and work plan, Nuance considered the risks and benefits of
pursuing a transaction with Party A at that time. In considering these matters, senior management noted that Nuance
had just completed its spin-off of Cerence and was nearing its first post-spin analyst day, scheduled for
27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
December 10, 2019, which Nuance had planned as a re-launch of the new, streamlined Nuance business. In light of
Nuance’s focus on, and the critical importance of, the re-launch of the Nuance business following the Cerence spin-
off and subsequent analyst day, the challenges and risks associated with diverting management time from those
execution priorities and the uncertainty regarding Party A’s interest, Nuance determined to defer further
conversations with Party A.
In late October 2019, representatives of Nuance spoke with representatives of Party A, and informed them that, in
light of the recently completed Cerence spin-off and the planned analyst day, Nuance was not prepared to engage in
discussions regarding a potential sale transaction at that time.
On December 10, 2019, Nuance hosted its planned analyst day. On that date, the closing price of Nuance common
stock was $17.60 per share.
In January 2020, a representative of Evercore reviewed in the ordinary course of business development activities with
representatives of a large healthcare services and technology company, which we refer to as Party C, a number of
potential acquisition opportunities, one of which was a potential acquisition of Nuance. During the conversation,
representatives of Party C expressed interest in scheduling a meeting with Nuance in the upcoming weeks. At the
request of Party C, the representative of Evercore discussed the possibility of an introduction to Party C with
members of Nuance senior management, who authorized scheduling such a meeting. The meeting was first scheduled
for February 13, 2020, then rescheduled to March 30, 2020. On March 24, 2020, the rescheduled meeting was
postponed indefinitely due to the developing COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying volatility in the broader
stock market, including a decline in the price of Nuance’s common stock, which had closed at $14.79 per share on
March 23, 2020.
On February 25, 2020, during a conversation regarding another company in the ordinary course of business
development activities, a representative of a leading cloud technology and e-commerce company, which we refer to
as Party D, conveyed to representatives of Evercore Party D’s interest in meeting with the senior leadership of
Nuance to explore potential opportunities involving Nuance, ranging from a potential strategic partnership in
healthcare to a potential acquisition of Nuance. The representative of Party D characterized their interest as
preliminary, and indicated that Party D was seeking the meeting to learn more about Nuance’s healthcare business in
light of its own nascent activities in the space. Following that conversation, a representative of Evercore
communicated to Nuance senior management Party D’s interest in a meeting with Nuance senior leadership.
Representatives of Nuance and Party D scheduled a meeting for April 9, 2020, but subsequently canceled that
meeting due to the developing COVID-19 pandemic. Following such cancellation, Party D did not seek to reengage
with Nuance and Nuance and Party D did not have further discussions.
On April 22, 2020, Mr. Benjamin and representatives of Party A had a telephone conversation for the purpose of
keeping in touch. During that conversation, Party A did not renew its request to meet with Nuance to discussion a
potential transaction.
On or around May 14, 2020, a representative of Party C in a conversation with a representative of Evercore, indicated
Party C’s desire to reengage in discussions with Nuance. Following that conversation, the representative of Evercore
communicated Party C’s interest to Nuance senior management, who scheduled such a meeting.
On June 19, 2020, representatives of Party C met with members of Nuance senior management at Nuance’s offices. At
that meeting, Nuance representatives provided a high level overview of Nuance’s Healthcare business based only on
publicly available information, and Party C requested a second meeting to review Nuance’s Enterprise business and
to address follow up questions relating to the Healthcare business.
On June 26, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin informed the Nuance
Board of Directors of the meeting with representatives of Party C. Following extensive discussion, the Nuance Board
of Directors instructed Nuance management to hold another in-person meeting with Party C as had been requested
by Party C.
On July 9, 2020, representatives of Party C had a phone conversation with Nuance senior executives to discuss
Nuance technology.
On July 22, 2020, representatives of Party C met with representatives of Nuance at Nuance’s offices, during which the
representatives of Party C and Nuance discussed Nuance’s Enterprise and Healthcare businesses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 27, 2020, a representative of Party C informed a representative of Evercore that Party C was interested in
further exploring a potential acquisition of Nuance. A representative of Evercore communicated Party C’s interests to
members of Nuance senior management.
On or around September 7, 2020, a senior executive of Party C contacted Mr. Benjamin and conveyed a request from
the Chief Executive Officer of Party C for another meeting at Nuance’s offices and a demonstration of Nuance’s
Dragon® Ambient eXperience™ product, which we refer to as DAX.
On September 11, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin updated the
Nuance Board of Directors on discussions with representatives of Party C. Also at that meeting, a representative of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, Nuance’s external legal counsel, which we refer to as Paul Weiss,
reviewed with the Nuance Board of Directors the directors’ duties in the context of a potential acquisition offer.
Following discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors instructed Mr. Benjamin to have the meeting with the Chief
Executive Officer of Party C.
On September 15, 2020, representatives of Nuance’s senior management met with the Chief Executive Officer of Party
C and the president of one of Party C’s divisions. At that meeting, Nuance representatives answered questions
regarding the business and gave a demonstration of DAX. During the meeting, Mr. Benjamin made clear that he
believed Nuance was in a strong position and expressed his view that the market was not overvaluing Nuance’s
shares. After such meeting, the representatives of Party C indicated to representatives of Evercore that the recent
increase in Nuance’s share price had created valuation challenges for Party C in pursuing an acquisition of Nuance,
noting that the price of Nuance common stock had increased from approximately $25.00 per share when Party C
began discussions in June 2020 to $32.97 as of close of trading on September 15, 2020. Representatives of Evercore
communicated Party C’s views to members of Nuance senior management.
On September 18, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin updated the
Nuance Board of Directors on discussions with representatives of Party C. Also at that meeting, the Nuance Board of
Directors received an update from Nuance management on Nuance’s stock performance, including Nuance’s 5-year
price performance and trading multiples relative to peers.
On September 29, 2020, representatives of Party C informed representatives of Nuance and Evercore that Party C did
not wish to pursue a strategic transaction with Nuance at that time or for the foreseeable future, primarily due to Party
C’s view on Nuance’s valuation and that any offer at a “market” premium to Nuance would be too dilutive to Party
C’s stockholders. They indicated that they could be interested in making an offer in the future if Nuance’s share price
were to fall appreciably from where it was then trading, and in the meantime would like to continue to build upon the
commercial aspects of the relationship between Nuance and Party C. The closing price of Nuance common stock on
that date was $33.07 per share, which was approximately 121.8% higher than the closing price of Nuance common
stock on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief Executive Officer (or approximately 165.0% higher if
including the value of the Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).
On October 2, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin informed the
Nuance Board of Directors of Party C’s decision not to pursue a transaction.
On November 11, 2020, a representative of Evercore had, in the ordinary course of business development activities,
an introductory conversation with a senior executive at Microsoft. In the course of such conversation, which
addressed multiple topics, including Microsoft’s activities in the healthcare sector, the Evercore representative
discussed recent developments with respect to Nuance. These discussions were preliminary and based solely on
publicly available information, and no valuations involving Nuance were discussed. The representative of Microsoft
expressed Microsoft’s strategic interest in Nuance’s healthcare business, especially given the success of the
ongoing partnership between the two companies, but noted that Microsoft’s willingness to consider a potential
transaction was tempered by the highly people-intensive nature of Nuance’s Health Information Management
Transcription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business.
On November 18, 2020, in conjunction with its earnings announcement, Nuance announced the sale of its Health
Information Management Transcription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business, which
Nuance had been negotiating over the prior several months.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 19, 2020, representatives of Microsoft contacted representatives of Evercore and requested a meeting
with Nuance’s management in order to begin evaluating the merits of a potential acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft.
During this discussion, the representatives of Microsoft noted that the process would include a series of business
and financial due diligence meetings to validate whether Microsoft did indeed want to pursue an acquisition of
Nuance. Representatives of Evercore conveyed this request to Mr. Benjamin.
On November 24, 2020, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting at which Mr. Benjamin
informed the Nuance Board of Directors of Microsoft’s request for a meeting to explore a potential acquisition.
Following discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors authorized a meeting with Microsoft to discuss with Microsoft
only publicly available information concerning Nuance.
On December 7, 2020, representatives of Microsoft and representatives of Nuance held an initial meeting at which
those present discussed Nuance’s business and the potential benefits of a combination.
On December 18, 2020, representatives of Party C and representatives of Nuance had a telephone discussion focused
on potential commercial partnership opportunities between Party C and Nuance. There was no discussion of an
acquisition of Nuance by Party C in that conversation.
Following the meeting on December 7, 2020, various representatives of Microsoft had follow-up conversations with
representatives of Nuance, in the course of which representatives of Microsoft requested follow-up meetings with
Nuance in January to review Nuance’s Healthcare and Enterprise businesses and the potential long-term
opportunities for the two companies on a combined basis. Representatives of Microsoft indicated that following
such meetings and shortly after Nuance’s next earnings release, Microsoft intended to either make a formal proposal
for an acquisition of Nuance or notify Nuance that it did not wish to move forward with making an offer.
On December 22, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Nuance management updated
the Nuance Board of Directors on its discussions with Microsoft. The Nuance Board of Directors authorized Nuance
management to schedule the additional meetings that Microsoft had requested.
On January 9, 2021, Microsoft and Nuance executed a nondisclosure agreement. The nondisclosure agreement did
not contain a standstill provision.
During January 2021, representatives of Microsoft and Nuance held several virtual due diligence sessions, focused
on issues including technology, enterprise, go-to-market, financials and potential synergies.
On February 2, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting with members of Nuance senior
management, as well as representatives of Evercore and Paul Weiss, attending. At the meeting, representatives of
Evercore updated the Nuance Board of Directors on the discussions with Microsoft, and members of Nuance
management presented to the Nuance Board of Directors financial forecasts for Nuance for the 2021-2025 fiscal years,
which are described in more detail in the section entitled “Financial Forecasts.” In anticipation of receiving a proposal
from Microsoft, representatives of Evercore presented a preliminary valuation analysis of Nuance. The members of
the Nuance Board of Directors, management and the legal and financial advisors also discussed other potential
acquirers, including the fact that an acquisition by certain large technology companies that had the financial
capability to afford an acquisition of Nuance would present substantially greater regulatory risk than the merger, as
well as the risk that Microsoft might decline to provide a proposal or discontinue its discussions with Nuance if it
were to become known that Nuance had approached other potential acquirers. At the same meeting, members of
Nuance senior management presented an overview of their go-forward business plan, and the opportunities and risks
associated with it, including potential disruption from companies with significantly more resources.
On February 15, 2021, in a telephone conversation between representatives of Microsoft and representatives of
Nuance, the representatives of Microsoft reaffirmed Microsoft’s interest in Nuance and indicated that an offer would
likely be forthcoming during the week of February 22, 2021, following approval of such offer by the Microsoft Board
of Directors. During this discussion, the representatives of Microsoft again noted that Microsoft would require its
customary confirmatory due diligence process and a co-terminus exclusivity period to complete that process.
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 28, 2021, representatives of Microsoft and representatives of Nuance had a telephone conversation in
which Microsoft indicated that it would be sending an offer letter for an acquisition of all of the outstanding shares
of Nuance. During this discussion, representatives of Microsoft noted that Microsoft would require an exclusivity
period for Microsoft to complete its confirmatory due diligence prior to entering into a transaction agreement.
Also on February 28, 2021, Microsoft submitted an offer letter containing a nonbinding preliminary expression of
interest to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Nuance for a purchase price of $53.50 per share, a 20% premium to
the volume-weighted average closing price of Nuance’s stock over the previous five trading days and a 6% premium
to Nuance’s 52-week high closing price. The letter noted that the transaction would not be subject to any financing
condition or require a vote of Microsoft’s stockholders and requested that Nuance deliver a response to Microsoft
no later than March 5, 2021; in addition, the letter did not specify the form of consideration, and was subject to
Nuance entering into a period of exclusive negotiations with Microsoft. On February 26, 2021, the last trading day
prior to February 28, 2021, the closing price of Nuance common stock was $44.60 per share, which was approximately
199.1% higher than the closing price of Nuance common stock on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became
Chief Executive Officer (or approximately 292.4% higher if including the value of the Cerence shares received by
Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).
On March 1, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Nuance senior
management, as well as representatives of Evercore and Paul Weiss, attending. At the meeting, representatives of
Paul Weiss reviewed the directors’ fiduciary duties in connection with a potential acquisition of Nuance. The
members of the Nuance Board of Directors, management and the legal and financial advisors then discussed the
terms of Microsoft’s offer, including the implied valuation, form of consideration, timetable and Microsoft’s insistence
that it would not proceed without exclusivity. The participants discussed the premium represented by Microsoft’s
offer, Nuance’s recent share price performance, the development of Nuance’s trading multiples, comparisons of the
Microsoft offer to selected measures of Nuance’s intrinsic value and multiples and premiums paid in relevant
precedent transactions, among other analyses.
At the March 1, 2021 meeting, the members of the Nuance Board of Directors, management and the legal and financial
advisors had an extensive discussion regarding whether Nuance should approach other potential buyers. In the
course of these discussions, the participants noted, among other factors, the dramatic rise in Nuance’s share price
over the preceding months, the limited number of potential buyers with the financial capacity to exceed the price
being offered by Microsoft, the fact that an acquisition by certain large technology companies, including Party D,
that had the financial capability to afford an acquisition of Nuance would present significantly greater regulatory risk
than the merger, the fact that Party C had stated the previous September (when Nuance’s share price was
substantially lower) that Nuance’s high valuation would preclude it from pursuing a transaction and the potential that
Microsoft would withdraw its offer if it were to become known that Nuance had approached other potential acquirers,
as well as other risks to Nuance in the event of a leak. At the conclusion of the meeting, following extensive
discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors instructed the representatives of Evercore to revert to Microsoft and ask it
to significantly increase its offer, without specifying a target price or range.
On March 3, 2021, acting on the instruction of the Nuance Board of Directors, representatives of Evercore advised
representatives of Goldman Sachs, Microsoft’s financial advisor, that while the Nuance Board of Directors was open
to engaging regarding a potential transaction, Microsoft would need to put forward a materially improved offer in
order to compel the Nuance Board of Directors to deviate from its compelling standalone path.
On March 4, 2021, at the instruction of Microsoft, representatives of Goldman Sachs informed representatives of
Evercore that, while Microsoft remained enthusiastic about a potential transaction, Microsoft was highly sensitive to
valuation given the recent significant run-up in Nuance’s share price, was not willing to negotiate against itself and
proposed that Nuance make a counteroffer.
On March 4, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting with members of Nuance senior
management. Representatives of Evercore and Paul Weiss were also in attendance. At that meeting, in response to a
February 2021 request from the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin reviewed for the Nuance Board of Directors
his thoughts regarding the execution and market risks underlying Nuance’s current management plan. Among other
topics, Mr. Benjamin addressed the extent to which Nuance’s future successful
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
execution of its plan was already embedded in its share price, the competitive threats to Nuance, particularly from
companies with significantly greater resources, and the extent to which Nuance’s balance sheet limited its ability to
accelerate its growth organically or inorganically.
Following Mr. Benjamin’s presentation at the March 4, 2021 Board meeting, a representative from Evercore updated
the Nuance Board of Directors on the response from Goldman Sachs. The members of the Nuance Board of Directors,
management and legal and financial advisors discussed alternatives for responding to Microsoft and comparisons of
the Microsoft offer to measures of Nuance’s value. The participants also again discussed the benefits and risks of
approaching other potential acquirers. Following extensive discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors instructed the
representatives of Evercore to revert to Goldman Sachs with a counteroffer of $62 per share.
On March 5, 2021, acting on the instructions of the Nuance Board of Directors, a representative of Evercore provided
feedback to representatives of Goldman Sachs that the Nuance Board of Directors would consider entering into a
transaction with Microsoft at a price of $62 per share. On that date, the closing price of Nuance common stock was
$42.58 per share, which was approximately 185.6% higher than the closing price of Nuance common stock on April 23,
2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief Executive Officer (or approximately 261.7% higher if including the
value of the Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).
On March 8, 2021, at the instruction of Microsoft, a representative of Goldman Sachs informed a representative of
Evercore that Microsoft needed more time to respond to the counterproposal given ongoing market volatility and
restated Microsoft’s sensitivity to valuation given the recent significant run-up in Nuance’s share price.
On March 9, 2021, Microsoft submitted a revised written, nonbinding preliminary expression of interest to Nuance to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Nuance for a purchase price of $54.50 per share, a 30% premium to the
volume-weighted average closing price of Nuance’s stock over the previous five trading days and an 8% premium to
Nuance’s 52-week high closing price. The letter did not specify the form of consideration, and was subject to Nuance
entering into a period of exclusivity with Microsoft.
At the instruction of Nuance, a representative of Evercore and representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke later on
March 9, 2021. In that call, at the instruction of Nuance, the Evercore representative expressed disappointment that
the offer was not higher.
Later on March 9, 2021, Mr. Benjamin spoke by telephone with a representative of Microsoft. The Microsoft
representative expressed Microsoft’s excitement about the proposed transaction and optimism about the potential
combined business. The parties did not discuss in detail the proposed purchase price.
The Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting on March 10, 2021, with representatives of Nuance
management, Evercore and Paul Weiss participating. A representative of Evercore reported on the revised Microsoft
offer and the discussion with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Mr. Benjamin reported on the discussion with
Microsoft. The members of the Nuance Board of Directors, management and advisors then discussed the revised
offer and the respective premiums it represented to Nuance’s stock price over various periods and points in time, and
relative to Nuance’s revenue and EBITDA multiples, as well as a summary of the revised offer relative to various
valuation analyses. The meeting participants engaged in an extensive discussion regarding potential responses to
Microsoft’s offer and the potential benefits and risks of each. Following such discussion, the Nuance Board of
Directors instructed the representatives of Evercore to revert to Microsoft with a counteroffer of $57.50 per share.
On March 10, 2021, acting on the instructions of the Nuance Board of Directors, a representative of Evercore
provided feedback to representatives of Goldman Sachs that the Nuance Board of Directors would consider
transacting at a price of $57.50 per share, and asked that Microsoft confirm that the proposal contemplated all cash.
On March 11, 2021, Microsoft submitted a revised written, nonbinding preliminary expression of interest to Nuance to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Nuance for a purchase price of $55.50 per share in cash, a 31.7% premium to
the volume-weighted average closing price of Nuance’s stock over the previous five trading days and a 10% premium
to Nuance’s 52-week high closing price. In a conversation later that day, a representative of Goldman Sachs
characterized that offer as “the final move” to a representative of Evercore and stated that Microsoft’s offer was
conditioned on Nuance agreeing to a 30-day exclusivity period to negotiate a
32
TABLE OF CONTENTS
transaction and allow Microsoft to complete its due diligence. On that date, the closing price of Nuance common
stock was $44.41 per share, which was approximately 197.9% higher than the closing price of Nuance common stock
on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief Executive Officer (or approximately 292.3% higher if
including the value of the Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).
The Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting on March 11, 2021, with representatives of Nuance
management, Evercore and Paul Weiss participating. A representative of Evercore reported on the revised Microsoft
offer. The members of the Nuance Board of Directors, management and legal and financial advisors again discussed
the financial analyses previously reviewed, the likelihood that Microsoft could be negotiated to a higher price and
whether Nuance should grant the requested exclusivity period. Following extensive discussion, the Nuance Board of
Directors instructed Evercore to revert to Microsoft with a counteroffer of $56.00 per share, at which price Nuance
would agree to the requested exclusivity period.
On March 11, 2021, in accordance with the instructions of the Nuance Board of Directors, a representative of
Evercore communicated to a representative of Goldman Sachs that the Nuance Board of Directors would be willing to
transact at a price of $56.00 per share and to grant the requested exclusivity period at that price.
On March 12, 2021, acting on the instructions of Microsoft, Goldman Sachs submitted to Evercore a revised written,
nonbinding preliminary expression of interest for Microsoft to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Nuance for a
purchase price of $56.00 per share, a 32.6% premium to the volume-weighted average closing price of Nuance’s stock
over the previous five trading days and an 11% premium to Nuance’s 52- week high closing price, and indicated that
Microsoft was not willing to proceed in further discussions unless exclusivity was granted. Microsoft also provided
Nuance with a draft exclusivity agreement, providing for a period of exclusivity ending on April 12, 2021. At the time
of the offer, the prior closing price of Nuance common stock was $44.41 per share, which was approximately 197.9%
higher than the closing price of Nuance common stock on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief
Executive Officer (or approximately 292.3% higher if including the value of the Cerence shares received by Nuance
stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).
Over the course of March 12, 2021, representatives of Paul Weiss and representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett
LLP, Microsoft’s external legal counsel, which we refer to as Simpson Thacher, negotiated the terms of the exclusivity
agreement. Later that day, Microsoft and Nuance executed the exclusivity agreement, pursuant to which Nuance
agreed to work with Microsoft on an exclusive basis through April 12, 2021 to pursue the potential transaction.
On March 13, 2021, Microsoft provided Nuance with a preliminary due diligence request list. Over the following
weeks, until the execution of the merger agreement, representatives of Microsoft, Nuance and their respective
advisors communicated frequently with respect to outstanding diligence material requests and questions.
On March 22, 2021, Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, sent an initial draft of the merger agreement to Paul
Weiss. The agreement provided for, among other terms, a termination fee that would have equaled approximately $734
million based on transaction equity value, which would be payable by Nuance under certain circumstances, including
if Nuance terminated the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal.
On March 30, 2021, Paul Weiss, on behalf of Nuance, sent a markup of the draft merger agreement to Simpson
Thacher. The Paul Weiss markup, among other changes, included a termination fee that would have equaled
approximately $392 million based on transaction equity value and numerous revisions to the terms of merger
agreement that would preserve closing certainty, including an enhanced obligation by Microsoft to take actions
necessary to obtain required regulatory clearances.
On March 30, 2021, a representative from Simpson Thacher advised a representative from Paul Weiss that the
continued employment following closing of Mr. Benjamin and of Dan Tempesta, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer of Nuance, was essential to Microsoft’s willingness to proceed with the transaction, that Microsoft
would not consider entering into a transaction with Nuance if Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta did not agree to
continue their employment with Nuance following the closing of the transaction (which would include Messrs.
Benjamin and Tempesta waiving certain contractual rights under their respective employment agreements) and that
Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta should consider retaining counsel to represent themselves in connection with a
forthcoming proposal by Microsoft for Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta to waive certain rights in connection with
their existing employment agreements.
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On March 31, 2021, Nuance entered into an engagement letter with Evercore for the provision of financial advisory
services with respect to strategic and financial alternatives. Nuance selected Evercore to act as its financial advisor
based on Evercore’s qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business of Nuance and the industry
in which it operates.
On April 2, 2021, Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, sent a markup of the merger agreement to Paul Weiss. The
Simpson Thacher markup, among other changes, provided for a termination fee that would have equaled
approximately $636 million based on transaction equity value.
On April 5, 2021, representatives of Paul Weiss and Simpson Thacher held a videoconference in which they
discussed outstanding open issues in the merger agreement. Later that day, Paul Weiss, on behalf of Nuance, sent a
markup of the Merger Agreement to Simpson Thacher which, among other terms, provided for a termination fee that
would have equaled approximately $431 million based on transaction equity value.
Also on April 5, 2021, after having been informed by a representative of Paul Weiss that they believed that there was
a clear path to resolving all remaining issues under the Merger Agreement, the Nuance Board of Directors granted
approval for Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta to engage in discussions with Microsoft regarding their respective
employment agreements for the period following the closing of the merger. Between April 6 and April 11, 2021, a
representative of Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, presented draft retention letters to each of Messrs.
Benjamin and Tempesta and legal counsel to Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta negotiated with representatives of
Simpson Thacher regarding the terms of each of Mr. Benjamin’s and Mr. Tempesta’s continued employment following
closing. During such discussions, the representatives of Simpson Thacher reiterated that Mr. Benjamin’s and Mr.
Tempesta’s continued employment following closing was essential to Microsoft’s willingness to proceed with the
transaction, and that Microsoft would not consider entering into a transaction with Nuance if Messrs. Benjamin and
Tempesta did not agree to continue their employment with Nuance following the closing of the transaction (which
would include Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta waiving certain contractual rights under their respective employment
agreements).
Between April 5, 2021 and April 9, 2021, representatives of Paul Weiss, representatives of Simpson Thacher and
members of management of each of Nuance and Microsoft and representatives of their respective financial advisors
had multiple conversations to resolve outstanding issues under the merger agreement and ancillary agreements and
exchanged multiple drafts of those agreements. As part of those discussions, on April 9, 2021, Microsoft and Nuance
agreed to set the termination fee at $515 million. On April 9, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a
videoconference meeting, with representatives of Nuance management, Evercore and Paul Weiss participating.
Representatives of Evercore made a presentation to the directors that reviewed the terms of the transaction, the
premium to various benchmarks and multiples implied by the proposed $56.00 per share price, as well as a summary of
the revised offer relative to various valuation analyses. Also at this meeting, Evercore reviewed with the Nuance
Board of Directors its financial analysis of the merger consideration and delivered to the Nuance Board of Directors
its opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 9, 2021, to the effect that,
as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described
in Evercore’s opinion, the merger consideration of $56.00 per share to be received by the holders of shares of Nuance
common stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For more information about
Evercore’s opinion, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Fairness Opinion of Evercore.” A
representative of Paul Weiss then made a presentation to the Nuance Board of Directors that reviewed the fiduciary
duties of directors as previously discussed, and then reviewed the proposed terms of the merger agreement,
including the conditions to closing, each party’s termination rights, the ability of the Nuance Board of Directors to
respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals, Microsoft’s obligations with respect to obtaining regulatory clearances
and the provisions of the merger agreement relating to employee benefits, incentive equity and bonus payments and
related matters. A representative of Paul Weiss explained the circumstances under which Nuance could be required to
pay a termination fee and the fact that the termination fee as negotiated was at the low end of the range of termination
fees for comparable transactions. A representative of Paul Weiss reported on the retention letters presented to
Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta. After extensive discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors (i) determined that it was
advisable and in the best interests of Nuance and its stockholders for Nuance to enter into the merger agreement; (ii)
approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement; (iii) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of Nuance vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; and (iv) resolved to submit the merger
agreement to Nuance’s stockholders for adoption at the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Over April 10, 2021 and April 11, 2021, representatives of Simpson Thacher and Paul Weiss spoke on numerous
occasions to finalize the terms of ancillary documents and prepare for execution of the merger agreement. At the same
time, counsel to Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta finalized the terms of the retention letter agreements with Microsoft,
which are described below under “Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
On April 11, 2021, the merger agreement was executed and delivered by the parties.
On April 12, 2021, Nuance and Microsoft issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger
agreement.
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger
Recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors to Adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby Approving the
Transactions Contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
On April 9, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors, after considering various factors described below, and after
consultation with independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests
of Nuance and its stockholders to enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein and declared the merger agreement advisable; (ii) approved the execution
and delivery of the merger agreement by Nuance, the performance by Nuance of its covenants and other obligations
thereunder, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; (iii) directed that
the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of Nuance and (iv)
resolved to recommend that Nuance stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement in accordance
with the DGCL.
The Nuance Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, thereby approving the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.
Reasons for the Merger
In recommending that Nuance’s stockholders vote in favor of the merger proposal, the Nuance Board of Directors
considered a number of potentially positive factors, including, but not limited to, the following (which factors are not
necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
•
Premium to Market Price. The fact that the merger consideration of $56.00 per share in cash to be received
by the holders of shares of Nuance common stock in the merger represents a significant premium over the
market price at which shares of Nuance common stock traded prior to the announcement of the execution of
the merger agreement, including the fact that the merger consideration represents a premium of:
•
approximately 275.6% over the closing stock price on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin
became Chief Executive Officer of Nuance (or approximately 353.3% higher if including the value of the
Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off);
•
approximately 277.7% over the closing stock price on October 2, 2019, the date after the date that
Nuance completed the Cerence spin-off (or approximately 303.7% higher if including the value of the
Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off);
•
approximately 96.3% over the volume-weighted average closing price of Nuance common stock for the
period beginning October 2, 2019, the date after the date that Nuance completed the Cerence spin-off,
and ended April 8, 2021;
•
approximately 66.0% over the volume-weighted average closing stock price of shares of Nuance
common stock for the one-year period ended April 8, 2021;
•
approximately 23.8% over the closing stock price of Nuance common stock on April 8, 2021, the last
trading day prior to the approval of the transaction;
•
approximately 28.6% over the volume-weighted average closing stock price of shares of Nuance
common stock during the 30 days ended April 8, 2021; and
•
approximately 10.9% over the highest closing stock price of shares of Nuance common stock during
the 52-week period ended April 8, 2021.
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Form of Consideration. The fact that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, which provides
stockholders certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Nuance common stock following a period of
dramatic growth in Nuance’s stock price while eliminating long term business and execution risks.
•
Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C. The delivery of the opinion of Evercore, dated April 9, 2021, to the
Nuance Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the
opinion and based upon and subject to the various qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, of the
merger consideration to the holders of Nuance common stock, as more fully described below in the section
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - Opinion of Nuance’s Financial
Advisor - Opinion of Evercore Group, L.L.C.” beginning on page 39.
•
Fair Value. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors that the merger represents fair value for the shares
of Nuance common stock, taking into account the Nuance Board of Directors’ familiarity with Nuance’s
current and historical financial condition, results of operations, business, competitive position and
prospects, as well as Nuance’s future business plan and potential long-term value.
•
Loss of Opportunity. The possibility that, if the Nuance Board of Directors declined to adopt the merger
agreement, there may not be another opportunity for Nuance’s stockholders to receive a comparably priced
transaction with a comparable level of closing certainty.
•
Risks Inherent in Nuance’s Business Plan. Nuance’s short-term and long-term financial projections and the
perceived challenges and risks associated with Nuance’s ability to meet such projections, including the
competitive threats facing Nuance, particularly from companies with significantly more resources, as well as
the risks and uncertainties described in the “risk factors” and “forward looking statements” sections of
Nuance’s disclosures filed with the SEC, including the fact that Nuance’s actual financial results in future
periods could differ materially and adversely from the projected results.
•
Arm’s-Length Negotiations. The fact that the Nuance Board of Directors and Nuance’s senior management,
in coordination with Nuance’s outside legal and financial advisors, vigorously negotiated on an arm’s-
length basis with Microsoft with respect to price and other terms and conditions of the merger agreement,
including obtaining a price increase by Microsoft from its initial price of $53.50 per share to a price of $56.00
per share as well as the stated position of Microsoft that the agreed price was the highest price per share to
which Microsoft was willing to agree. In addition, the Nuance Board of Directors considered the fact that,
as to matters related to retention arrangements for key executives, such retention arrangements were not
discussed with Microsoft until after Microsoft increased its price per share to a price of $56.00 per share
and substantially all terms of the merger agreement were agreed.
•
Other Strategic Alternatives. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors, following multiple years of
reviews of strategy alternatives and transformative transactions, and considering the remaining strategic
alternatives reasonably available to Nuance (including continuing to operate on a stand-alone basis), in
each case taking into account the potential benefits, risks and uncertainties associated with those
alternatives, that the merger represents Nuance’s best reasonably available prospect for maximizing the
value to Nuance’s stockholders.
•
Board Review of Transaction. The fact that the Nuance Board of Directors met, along with Nuance’s
financial and legal advisors, to evaluate and discuss the material terms and conditions of, and other matters
related to, the merger, in person and telephonically eight times between November 19, 2020, the date that
representatives of Microsoft requested a meeting with Nuance’s management to begin evaluating the
merits of a potential acquisition, and April 11, 2021, the date the merger agreement was signed, and the fact
that, during the prior September (when Nuance’s share price was substantially lower), Party C had stated
that Nuance’s high valuation would preclude Party C from pursuing a transaction with Nuance.
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors that the provisions of the
merger agreement, including the respective representations, warranties and covenants and termination
rights of the parties and termination fees payable by Nuance, are reasonable and customary. The Nuance
Board of Directors also believed that the terms of the merger agreement include the most favorable terms
reasonably attainable from Microsoft.
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Conditions to the Consummation of the Merger; Likelihood of Closing. The fact that the Nuance Board of
Directors considered the reasonable likelihood of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement in light of the conditions in the merger agreement to the obligations of Microsoft, as
well as Nuance’s ability to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement,
including to cause the merger to be consummated if all of the conditions to Microsoft’s obligations to
effect the merger closing have been satisfied or waived.
•
Regulatory Approvals. The fact that the merger agreement requires that Microsoft use its reasonable best
efforts to take certain actions necessary to obtain regulatory clearance and satisfy the regulatory
conditions, including the fact that Microsoft agreed to accept potential remedies in order to obtain
regulatory approval, including Microsoft’s commitment to divest or take other actions with respect to
businesses or assets of Nuance, unless such additional remedies would reasonably be expected to result in
a material adverse effect on Nuance and its subsidiaries, and Microsoft’s commitment to divest or take
other actions with respect to businesses or assets of Microsoft, unless such additional remedies would
reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by
Microsoft or have more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft and its
subsidiaries. For a more complete description of Microsoft’s obligations to obtain required regulatory
approvals, see the section below entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Efforts to Close the Merger”
beginning on page 72. The merger agreement also provides an appropriate “termination date” by which
time it is reasonable to expect that the regulatory conditions are likely to be satisfied. For a more complete
description of the termination date, see the section below entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement -
Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 74.
•
No Financing Condition. The fact that Microsoft’s representations contained in the merger agreement
include a representation that Microsoft will have all available funds necessary for the payment of the
aggregate merger consideration and the fact that the merger is not subject to a financing condition.
•
Ability to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Takeover Proposals. The fact that, while the merger agreement
prohibits Nuance from actively soliciting competing bids to acquire it, the Nuance Board of Directors has
rights, under certain circumstances, to engage in discussions with, and provide information to, third parties
submitting written unsolicited takeover proposals and to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter
into an alternative acquisition agreement that the Nuance Board of Directors determines to be a superior
proposal, provided that Nuance pays a $515,000,000 termination fee. The Nuance Board of Directors further
considered that the timing of the merger would provide ample opportunity for such third parties to submit
proposals.
•
Change of Recommendation. The fact that the Nuance Board of Directors has the right to make an adverse
recommendation change to Nuance stockholders if a superior proposal is available or an intervening event
has occurred, provided that Nuance pays a $515,000,000 termination fee if Microsoft terminates the merger
agreement.
•
Termination Fee. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors that the termination fee of $515,000,000 is
reasonable in amount, at the low end of the range of termination fees for comparable transactions and will
not unduly deter any other party that might be interested in acquiring Nuance.
•
Retention of Key Employees. The belief of the Nuance Board of Directors that a retention plan for certain
employees of Nuance that Nuance would be permitted to implement in connection with the merger would
help assure the continuity of management, and increase the likelihood of the successful operation of
Nuance during the period prior to closing.
•
Appraisal Rights. The availability of appraisal rights with respect to the merger for Nuance stockholders
who properly exercise their rights under the DGCL, which would give these stockholders the ability to seek
and be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the “fair value” of their shares at the completion of the
merger.
•
Recommendation of Senior Management. The recommendation of Nuance’s senior management in favor of
the merger.
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Nuance Board of Directors also considered and balanced against the potentially positive factors a number of
uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (not necessarily in
order of relative importance):
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The fact that Nuance’s stockholders will
lose the opportunity to realize additional potential long-term value through Nuance’s successful execution
as an independent public company.
•
Impact of Announcement on Nuance. The fact that the announcement and pendency of the merger, or the
failure to complete the merger, may result in significant costs to Nuance and cause substantial harm to
Nuance’s relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to attract and retain key
personnel and the possible loss of key management and other personnel) and its customers, partners,
providers and suppliers, particularly in the event that the merger is not consummated.
•
Diversion of Management Attention. The substantial time and effort of management required to
consummate the merger, which could disrupt Nuance’s business operations and may divert employees’
attention away from Nuance’s day-to-day operations, and the impact of such efforts on Nuance’s business
in the event that the merger is not consummated.
•
Tax Treatment. The fact that the all-cash transaction would be taxable to holders of Nuance common stock
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•
Closing Certainty. The fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to
consummate the merger will be satisfied, including approval by the holders of Nuance common stock and
the approval of certain regulatory authorities.
•
Pre-Closing Covenants. The restrictions on Nuance’s conduct of business prior to completion of the
merger contained in the merger agreement, which could delay or prevent Nuance from undertaking
business opportunities that may arise or taking other actions with respect to its operations during the
pendency of the merger without Microsoft’s consent, and the impact of such delay or loss of business
opportunities on Nuance’s business in the event that the merger is not consummated.
•
No Solicitation. The restrictions in the merger agreement on Nuance’s ability to actively solicit competing
bids to acquire it.
•
Termination Fee. The fact that a termination fee of $515,000,000 could become payable to Microsoft under
specified circumstances, including upon the termination of the merger agreement in order to enter into an
alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal.
•
No Reverse Termination Fee. The fact that if the merger is not completed as a result of regulatory
impediments, Microsoft will not be obligated to pay any “reverse termination fee” to Nuance.
•
Loss of Key Personnel. The risk that, despite retention efforts prior to consummation of the merger, Nuance
may lose personnel, and the impact of such losses in the event that the merger is not consummated.
•
Timing of Closing. The amount of time it could take from the date of its deliberations and the special
meeting to complete the transactions, including the fact that an extended period of time may exacerbate the
impact of other risks considered by the Nuance Board of Directors described herein.
After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Nuance Board of Directors
concluded that the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the merger were
outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger to Nuance’s stockholders.
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Nuance Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive,
but summarizes the material factors considered by the Nuance Board of Directors. In light of the variety of factors
considered in connection with their evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the Nuance Board of
Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific
factors considered in reaching their determinations and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Nuance
Board of Directors applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have given different
weight to different factors. The Nuance Board of Directors did not undertake to make
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not
support their ultimate determinations. The Nuance Board of Directors based their recommendations on the totality
of the information presented, including thorough discussions with, and questioning of, Nuance’s senior
management and the Nuance Board of Directors’ financial advisors and outside legal counsel. It should be noted
that this explanation of the reasoning of the Nuance Board of Directors and certain information presented in this
section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in “Forward-Looking
Statements” beginning on page 20.
Opinion of Nuance’s Financial Advisor
Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.
Overview
Nuance retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. As part of this engagement,
Nuance requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to
be received by the holders of Nuance common stock. At a meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors held on April 9,
2021, Evercore rendered to the Nuance Board of Directors its opinion to the effect that, as of April 9, 2021 and based
upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the
merger consideration of $56.00 per share to be received by the holders of Nuance common stock in the merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated April 9, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of
review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated
herein by reference. Nuance encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore’s opinion
was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Nuance Board of Directors (in its capacity as
such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to
the Nuance Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of
shares of Nuance common stock should vote or act in respect of the merger. Evercore’s opinion does not address the
relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to
Nuance, nor does it address the underlying business decision of Nuance to engage in the merger.
In connection with rendering its opinion Evercore, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Nuance that Evercore
deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to Nuance prepared and furnished to Evercore
by management of Nuance, as approved for Evercore’s use by Nuance, which we refer to as the Nuance
Forecasts, which are described in more detail in the section entitled “Financial Forecasts”;
(iii)
discussed with management of Nuance their assessment of the past and current operations of Nuance,
the current financial condition and prospects of Nuance, and the Nuance Forecasts;
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of Nuance common stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of Nuance and its stock market trading multiples with those of
certain other publicly traded companies that Evercore deemed relevant;
(vi)
compared the financial performance of Nuance and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with
the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Evercore deemed
relevant;
(vii)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated April 8, 2021, of the Merger Agreement; and
(viii)
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore
deemed appropriate
Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Nuance Board of

For each of the selected companies, Evercore calculated (i) total enterprise value (defined as equity market
capitalization plus total debt (assuming conversion of convertible debt if in the money), plus preferred equity and
non-controlling interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of estimated revenue for the 2021 calendar
year, which we refer to as TEV / CY21E Revenue, (ii) total enterprise value as a multiple of estimated earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization before stock-based compensation expense, and certain non-recurring items,
which we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA (which, with respect to Nuance, excludes restructuring and other costs, net,
acquisition-related costs, net, and certain other expenses that result from unplanned events outside the ordinary
course of continuing operations), for the 2021 calendar year, which we refer to as 2021E Adjusted EBITDA, which
multiple we refer to as TEV / CY21E Adjusted EBITDA, and (iii) market value of equity (defined as equity market
capitalization) as a multiple of levered, after-tax free cash flows, which we refer to as LFCF, defined as cash flow from
operations less capital expenditures, which we refer to as MEV / CY21E LFCF, in each case, based on closing share
prices as of April 8, 2021. For purposes of calculating such multiples with respect to the HC & ENT companies,
Evercore assigned a weight of 60% to such healthcare technology companies and a weight of 40% to such enterprise
call center technology companies based on its professional judgment and experience. Estimated financial data of the
selected companies were based on publicly available filings and research analysts’ estimates.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to Nuance, Evercore selected these companies
because they are publicly traded companies that Evercore, in its professional judgment and experience, considered
generally relevant to Nuance for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the selected companies, Evercore
made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market conditions affecting the
selected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected companies’ financial, business and
operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the
relative values of the selected companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies. Mathematical
analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the
selected companies.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Nuance to calculate the estimated present value of the
standalone unlevered free cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus the expense of stock-based compensation,
minus taxes, minus changes in net working capital and capital expenditures, that Nuance was forecasted to generate
during the second half of Nuance’s fiscal year 2021 and Nuance’s fiscal years 2022 through 2025 based on the
Nuance Forecasts. Evercore calculated terminal values for Nuance by applying perpetuity growth rates of 4.0% to
5.0%, which range was selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal year
estimate of the unlevered free cash flow that Nuance was forecasted to generate based on the Nuance Forecasts. The
cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to present value as of March 31, 2021, using
discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.0%, which were based on an estimate of Nuance’s weighted average cost of
capital based on Evercore’s professional judgment and experience. Based on this range of implied enterprise values,
Nuance’s estimated net debt as of December 31, 2020, and the number of fully diluted shares of Nuance common
stock, in each case as provided by Nuance’s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per
share of Nuance common stock of $29.23 to $48.14, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of
Nuance common stock.
Other Factors
Evercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to
its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:
Sum-of-the-Parts Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) cash flow analysis of Nuance to calculate the estimated
present value of the unlevered free cash flow that Nuance was forecasted to generate during the second half of
Nuance’s fiscal year 2021 and Nuance’s fiscal years 2022 through 2025 based on the Nuance Forecasts. Evercore
calculated terminal values for Nuance (excluding the Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience, which we refer to as DAX)
by applying perpetuity growth rates of 3.5% to 4.5%, which range was selected based on Evercore’s professional
judgment and experience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow that Nuance was forecasted to
generate based on the Nuance Forecasts. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to
present value as of March 31, 2021, using discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.0%, which were based on an estimate
of Nuance’s weighted average cost of capital. Evercore also calculated terminal values for DAX by applying a
revenue multiple of 15.0x - 20.0x, which range was selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and
experience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow that DAX was forecasted to generate based on
the Nuance Forecasts. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to present value as of
March 31, 2021, using discount rates ranging from 17.5% to 22.5%, which were based on an estimate of the weighted
average cost of capital for Nuance in relation to DAX based on Evercore’s professional judgment and experience.
Based on this range of implied aggregate enterprise values, Nuance’s estimated net debt as of December 31, 2020, and
the number of fully diluted shares of Nuance common stock, in each case as provided by Nuance’s management, this
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Nuance common stock of $33.34 to $52.10, compared
to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Nuance common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Last 52-Week Trading Range
Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Nuance common stock during the 12-month period ended
April 8, 2021, noting that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged from $16.99 to $50.51 per share of
Nuance common stock, respectively.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Evercore reviewed public market trading price targets for the shares of Nuance common stock prepared and
published by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of April 8, 2021, the last trading date prior to the
rendering of Evercore’s opinion to the Nuance Board of Directors. These price targets reflect analysts’ estimates of
the future public market trading price of the shares of Nuance common stock at the time the price target was
published. As of April 8, 2021, the range of selected equity research analyst price targets per share of Nuance
common stock was $45.00 to $65.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not
necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of Nuance common stock and these target prices and
the analysts’ earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors
affecting the financial performance of Nuance and future general industry and market conditions.
Selected HC & ENT Transactions Analysis
Evercore reviewed financial information related to selected transactions involving target companies in the healthcare
technology and enterprise call center technology industry announced since, in the case of healthcare technology
transactions, 2018, and in the case of enterprise call center technology transactions, 2011, which we refer to as the HC
& ENT selected transactions.
For each healthcare technology selected transaction, Evercore calculated the announced transaction value or, if
unavailable, the implied enterprise value (defined as the target company’s implied equity value based on the
consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus preferred equity and non-controlling interest,
less cash and cash equivalents), as a multiple of the last 12-month revenue, which we refer to as LTM Revenue, if
available, for the target company at the time of the announcement of the applicable transaction (or where last 12-
month revenue information was not publicly available, as a multiple of the most recent calendar year revenue).
Estimated financial data of the healthcare technology selected transactions were based on publicly available
information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction.
This analysis indicated the following:

Nuance provided by Nuance’s management. Based on this range of implied enterprise values,

Nuance’s estimated net debt as of December 31, 2020, and the number of fully diluted shares of Nuance common
stock, in each case as provided by Nuance’s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per
share of Nuance common stock of $22.43 to $30.21, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of
Nuance common stock.
Although none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly
comparable to Nuance and none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the merger, Evercore selected
these transactions because they involve companies or businesses that Evercore, in its professional judgment and
experience, considered generally relevant to Nuance for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the selected
transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market
conditions and other factors existing at the time of the selected transactions, and other matters, as well as differences
in financial, business and operating characteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or businesses
in the selected transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the
relative values of the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions and the multiples derived from the
selected transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful
method of using the data of the selected transactions.
Selected Vertical Software Transactions Analysis
Evercore reviewed financial information related to selected transactions involving target companies in the vertical
software industry announced since 2017, which we refer to as the vertical software selected transactions. The vertical
software selected transactions reviewed by Evercore, and the month and year each was announced, were as follows:
For each vertical software selected transaction, Evercore calculated the announced transaction value, or if
unavailable, the implied enterprise value (defined as the target company’s implied equity value based on the
consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus preferred equity and non-controlling interest,
less cash and cash equivalents), as a multiple of the LTM Revenue, if available, for the target company at the time of
the announcement of the applicable transaction (or where last 12-month revenue information was not publicly
available, as a multiple of the most recent calendar year revenue). Estimated financial data of the vertical software
selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant
transaction.
This analysis indicated the following:

Based on the multiples it derived from the vertical software selected transactions and based on its professional

10.0x and applied this range of multiples to Nuance’s LTM Revenue as of March 31, 2021 based on the financial
results for Nuance provided by Nuance’s management. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Nuance’s
estimated net debt as of December 31, 2020, and the number of fully diluted shares of Nuance common stock, in each
case as provided by Nuance’s management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of
Nuance common stock of $34.03 to $37.86, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of Nuance
common stock.
Although none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly
comparable to Nuance and none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the merger, Evercore selected

Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 80 transactions and announced bids for control of U.S.
public targets with an aggregate transaction value greater than $10 billion announced from January 1, 2010 to April 1,
2021. Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the per
share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such transaction exceeded the closing market prices per
share of the target companies one day, one week and four weeks prior to announcement of each transaction.

Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium range
of 20.0% to 40.0% to the closing price per share of Nuance common stock of $45.22 as of April 8, 2021 (the last
trading date prior to the rendering of Evercore’s opinion to the Nuance Board of Directors) and $44.21 as of March 11,
2021 (last trading day prior to receipt of the offer of $56.00 per share of Nuance common stock), and applied a
premium range of 0.0% to 15.0% to the closing price per share of Nuance common stock of $50.51 as of February 8,
2021 (the 52-Week High). This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Nuance common stock
of $54.26 to $63.31, $53.29 to $62.17, and $50.51 to $58.09, compared to the merger consideration of $56.00 per share of
Nuance common stock.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of Evercore’s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by Evercore to the Nuance Board of Directors. In connection with the review of the
merger by the Nuance Board of Directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary
described above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Evercore’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of all the
analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it
for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional
judgment and experience after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given
various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various
assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis or combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with
respect to the actual value of the shares of Nuance common stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this
section not equaling the total of the figures shown.
Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Nuance Board of Directors as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of shares of Nuance common stock.
These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the business or securities
actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly,
estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty,
and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such
estimates.
Evercore’s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Nuance
Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger. The issuance of
Evercore’s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Nuance Board of Directors or Nuance’s
management or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the
merger for the holders of Nuance common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of Evercore’s engagement letter with Nuance, Nuance has agreed to pay Evercore a fee for its
services that is estimated as of the date of the Merger Agreement to be approximately $70 million, of which $7 million
was paid upon delivery of Evercore’s opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the
consummation of the merger. Nuance has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses and to indemnify
Evercore against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial advisory
services to Nuance and received fees for the rendering of these services in the amount of approximately $1.4 million.
During the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to
provide financial advisory or other services to Parent and Evercore has not received any compensation from Parent
during such period. Evercore may provide financial advisory or other services to Nuance and Parent in the future,
and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of
customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity,
placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or otherwise,
Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which any of them
may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or
otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior
loans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to Nuance or its affiliates, Parent,
potential parties to the merger and their respective affiliates or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers
of Nuance.
Nuance engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore’s qualifications, experience and reputation.
Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides fairness opinions to its
clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and valuations for corporate and other
purposes.",35,56
"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",Financial Forecasts,"Financial Forecasts
In connection with Nuance’s evaluation of the merger, Nuance management prepared non-public financial forecasts
as to the potential future performance of Nuance for the fiscal years 2021 to 2025, which we refer to as the “Nuance
Forecasts”. Nuance provided the Nuance Board of Directors and Evercore with the Nuance Forecasts in connection
with Evercore’s financial analyses summarized under Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger
“Opinion of Nuance’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 39 and also provided the Nuance Forecasts to
Microsoft.
Nuance does not normally publicly disclose long-term forecasts or projections as to future revenue, earnings or other
results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions
and estimates, including the difficulty of predicting general economic and market conditions. The Nuance Forecasts
were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement only because such
information was made available as described above. The Nuance Forecasts were not prepared with a view to
compliance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP,
the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information. The prospective financial information included in this proxy statement has been
prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Nuance’s management. BDO USA, LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined,
compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information
and, accordingly, BDO USA, LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
Although a summary of the Nuance Forecasts is presented with numerical specificity, the Nuance Forecasts reflect
numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management, including with respect to
demand for Nuance’s products and services, capital expenditure levels for the applicable periods, acquisition-related
expenditure levels for the applicable periods and other matters, many of which are difficult to

predict and subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties beyond Nuance’s control, that our
management believed in good faith were reasonable at the time the Nuance Forecasts were prepared, taking into
account the relevant information available to management at the time. However, this information is not fact and
should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual
results and cause the Nuance Forecasts not to be achieved include general economic and financial conditions,
industry performance, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows,
competitive pressures and other factors described or referenced under the section entitled “Forward-Looking
Statements” beginning on page 20. In addition, the Nuance Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or
events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be
no assurance that the Nuance Forecasts will or would be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse
than those contained in the Nuance Forecasts.
The Nuance Forecasts are not a reliable indication of future results, and Nuance and its management team and
advisors do not endorse the Nuance Forecasts as such, and they do not make any representation to readers of this
document concerning the ultimate performance of Nuance or the combined company compared to the Nuance
Forecasts. Nuance is including these Nuance Forecasts in this document solely because they were among the
financial information made available to the Nuance Board of Directors and Evercore in connection with their
evaluation of the merger, and not to influence your decision on how to vote on any proposal.
The Nuance Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
information regarding Nuance contained in our public filings with the SEC. Our management reviewed the Nuance
Forecasts with the Nuance Board of Directors, which considered the Nuance Forecasts in connection with its
evaluation and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.
The Nuance Forecasts constitute forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Nuance’s
future results to materially vary, see the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 20.
Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any
responsibility, to update or otherwise revise the Nuance Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date
when Nuance prepared the Nuance Forecasts or to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general
economic or industry conditions, even in the event that any of the assumptions underlying the Nuance Forecasts are
shown to be in error.
Certain of the measures included in the Nuance Forecasts may be considered non-GAAP financial measures,
including Adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered
in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP
financial measures as used by Nuance may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.
Pursuant to the published guidelines of the SEC, the non-GAAP financial measures are not required to be reconciled
to GAAP financial measures.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Treatment of Equity Compensation
Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Nuance common stock in the
form of stock options and stock units. Our executive officers hold RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of
Nuance common stock based on service over a time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to
receive shares of Nuance common stock ranging from 0% to 200% of the target number of shares based on both
service and achievement of performance goals for a specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold
RSUs and DSUs, which represents a right to receive shares of Nuance common stock, subject to vesting
requirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as separation from service. Our
executive officers and non-employee directors do not hold stock options. The merger agreement provides for the
treatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity awards:
Stock Options
Each stock option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration for each share of Nuance common stock
that would have been issuable upon exercise of the option, less the exercise price of the option and any applicable
withholding taxes. If the exercise price of a stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the
option will be cancelled as of the effective time for no consideration.
Stock Units
•
Each award of stock units that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the effective time or that will
become vested by its terms at the effective time and, in each case, by its terms is to be settled upon the
occurrence of vesting or the effective time will, as of the effective time, be deemed to be vested and will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of
Nuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes.
•
Each outstanding and unvested award of stock units will, as of the effective time, be converted into a
Rollover RSU as follows:
○
Each RSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that is subject to the same time-based vesting
schedule as the RSU.
○
Each PSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that, following the effective time, will vest based
solely on time at the conclusion of the original performance period of the PSU.
○
The number of shares of common stock of Microsoft subject to each Rollover RSU will be equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Nuance shares of common stock
subject to the corresponding RSU or PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by a
specified exchange ratio (see below). The number of Nuance shares of Nuance common stock subject
to each PSU immediately prior to the effective time will be determined based on (i) maximum
performance, for any PSU that was subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, and
(ii) target performance, for any PSU that was subject to financial and/or operational performance goals.
For each PSU that is subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, Nuance is
currently performing at a level that would result in maximum performance payout.
○
Notwithstanding the treatment of awards of outstanding and unvested stock units described above,
Microsoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and
converting an award into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of
Nuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes).
•
If the treatment described above of an award of stock units held by a non-U.S. employee would be
prohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the
applicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance), Microsoft will
provide compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have
been provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
as would not result in the imposition of additional taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
This compensation will be provided in the form of a cash payment (less any applicable taxes) or a new
equity award, as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance.
•
For purposes of the conversion of Nuance stock units described above, the “exchange ratio” is defined as
a fraction, the numerator of which is the merger consideration and the denominator of which is the volume
weighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above
rounded up) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the
last trading day immediately prior to the closing.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In accordance with the plan terms, each ESPP participant in the current offering period, which began on February 16,
2021, may not increase his or her payroll contribution rate or make separate non-payroll contributions, and no new
participants may enroll in the current offering period. In connection with the transaction with Microsoft, Nuance will
take all actions necessary to provide that:
•
if the closing occurs prior to August 13, 2021, which is the last day of the current offering period:
○
cause the current offering period to terminate no later than five business days prior to the closing
date;
○
make any pro-rata adjustments necessary to reflect the shortened offering period; and
○
cause the exercise (as of no later than one business day before the effective time) of each outstanding
purchase right and apply the funds credited to each participant’s payroll withholding account to the
purchase of whole shares of Nuance common stock;
•
provide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence; and
•
terminate the ESPP in its entirety, effective as of the effective time.
Accelerated Vesting of Equity Compensation Upon Certain Terminations
None of the Nuance equity awards provide for “single trigger” vesting immediately at the effective time (i.e., as a
result of the transaction with Microsoft without a termination of employment). However, under the terms of our
equity incentive plans and the award agreements for the RSUs and PSUs (as such agreements may be amended in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement) and, for certain employees, individual employment or change of
control severance agreements, the vesting of the Rollover RSUs (i.e., the stock-based awards of Microsoft) that are
converted at the effective time from unvested RSUs and PSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger
agreement will accelerate on a “double trigger” basis on qualifying terminations of employment after the effective
time, as follows:
•
Any such award held by an executive with the title of senior vice president or above (including our
executive officers) who is a party to a change of control severance agreement will accelerate if, during the
one-year period immediately following the effective time, the executive’s employment is terminated by the
employer without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason.”
•
Any such award held by an executive with the title of senior vice president or above who is not a party to a
change of control severance agreement will accelerate if, during the one-year period immediately following
the effective time, the executive’s employment is terminated by the executive for “good reason.”
•
Any such award held by any employee (including our executive officers) will accelerate if, at any time
before the award is scheduled to vest, the employee’s employment is terminated by the employer without
“cause” or due to the employee’s resignation as a result of the employee’s refusal to consent to a required
relocation of the employee’s principal place of employment of more than 50 miles.
Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Nuance in the Merger
When considering the recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our non-employee directors and executive officers may have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Nuance
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among
other matters, in evaluating and overseeing the negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger
agreement and the merger and in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of
Nuance.
Value of Shares and Equity Awards Held by Directors and Executive Officers
The estimated aggregate amount of the merger consideration payable with respect to Nuance shares held by our non-
employee directors and executive officers, as a group, assuming the merger closed on May 14, 2021, is approximately
$90.5 million.
The estimated aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by our non-employee directors and executive officers,
including our named executive officers, that would accelerate in connection with the merger, assuming the merger
closed on May 14, 2021, and, immediately thereafter, the director’s service terminated, or the executive officer’s
employment was terminated by the company without “cause” or the executive officer resigned for “good reason”
(each such term, as defined in the applicable agreement with Nuance) is approximately $5.2 million for our non-
employee directors, and approximately $228.2 million for our executive officers. These values do not include any new
Nuance equity awards that may be granted before the merger closes, as such awards will not have termination of
employment protections. These values are calculated based on the multiplying the number of shares underlying
awards by the cash consideration (based on the maximum number of shares underlying the relative TSR PSUs and
target number of shares underlying the financial metric PSUs). For estimates of the value of such unvested equity
awards for each of our named executive officers individually, see below under “Golden Parachute Compensation.”
Potential Payments to Executive Officers upon Termination in Connection with the Merger
We have entered into agreements with our executive officers, including our named executive officers, which would
entitle the executives to severance payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in
connection with the merger:
•
Mr. Benjamin’s executive employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by the
company without “cause” or if he resigns for “good reason” (as each such term is defined in his
agreement), in either case during the period beginning three months before and ending 12 months after a
change of control (which will occur at the effective time), he will be entitled to receive:
○
a lump sum payment equal to 250% of his annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the
termination date or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to the change of control;
○
a lump sum payment equal to 200% of his target annual bonus for the year in which his termination
occurs;
○
a pro-rated payment of his target annual bonus for the year of termination based on the percentage of
the fiscal year completed;
○
full vesting of his outstanding time-based equity awards (including any Rollover RSUs that are
converted from PSUs at the effective time, as described above under “Treatment of Equity
Compensation”); and
○
continued company-paid health insurance coverage for 18 months for him and his eligible dependents.
•
Each of our other executive officers (including our other named executive officers) has a change of control
and severance agreement that provides that if within one year after a change of control (which will occur at
the effective time), the officer’s employment is terminated by the company without “cause” or the officer
resigns for “good reason” (as each such term is defined in the agreement), the officer will be entitled to
receive:
○
a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of base salary as in effect immediately prior to the termination
date or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to the change of control;
○
a lump sum payment equal to 100% of the greater of the executive’s annual target bonus for the year
of termination or the executive’s target bonus in effect immediately prior to the change of control;
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
○
full vesting of the officer’s outstanding time-based equity awards (including any Rollover RSUs that
are converted from PSUs at the effective time, as described above under “Treatment of Equity
Compensation”); and
○
continued company-paid health insurance coverage for 12 months.
As a condition to receipt of the severance payments and benefits described above, each executive officer is required
to execute a separation and release of claims agreement in favor of the company and its affiliates and to continue to
comply with certain post-termination covenants in favor of the company and its affiliates.
The estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance our executive officers, including our named executive officers,
would have received upon a qualifying termination of employment, assuming the merger closed on May 14, 2021, and
the qualifying termination occurred immediately thereafter, is approximately $10.3 million. For estimates of the
amounts of such cash severance that each of our named executive officers would have received individually, see
below under “Golden Parachute Compensation.”
The employment agreement with Mr. Benjamin and the change of control and severance agreement with Mr.
Tempesta will be modified, effective upon the closing of the merger, as further described below under “New
Arrangements with Microsoft.”
Future Nuance Equity Grants
Under the terms of the merger agreement, we may continue to grant ordinary course equity awards, including annual
awards to employees with the title of vice president or below on or about July 1, 2021 (with an aggregate value of up
to $41.5 million), annual awards to employees with the title of senior vice president or above (including our executive
officers) on or about November 1, 2021 (with an aggregate value of up to $38 million), and awards to new hires (with
an aggregate value of up to $7.4 million), in each case, if the effective time has not yet occurred. These awards will be
granted in the form of time-vesting RSUs that will not accelerate in connection with the merger or termination of
employment (whether occurring before or after the effective time). We may also make ordinary course annual awards
to our non-employee directors in January 2022, if the effective time has not yet occurred, in the form of time-vesting
RSUs (with a grant date value not to exceed $250,000 per director, as provided under our 2020 Stock Plan).
Special Bonuses
Under the terms of the merger agreement, we may grant special cash bonuses to employees (including our executive
officers) in an aggregate amount of up to $25 million and enter into agreements to provide for such bonuses. As of
the date of this proxy statement, no such bonuses have been granted.
New Arrangements with Microsoft
CEO and CFO Letter Agreements with Microsoft
The following is a summary of the material terms of the letter agreements entered into on April 11, 2021, between each
of Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta and Microsoft, in each case, subject to the closing of the merger:
•
Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta will continue to serve as Nuance’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, respectively;
•
Mr. Benjamin will report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft’s Executive Vice President of Cloud + AI Group (or his
successor), and Mr. Tempesta will report to Mr. Benjamin (or, upon his death, his successor);
•
Their annual salaries and target annual bonuses will remain the same as currently in effect ($800,000 salary
and target bonus of 150% of salary, for Mr. Benjamin; $500,000 salary and target bonus of 75% of salary, for
Mr. Tempesta);
•
Following the closing, Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta will be eligible for annual equity awards, with a
target grant date value of $9,000,000 for Mr. Benjamin and $2,750,000 for Mr. Tempesta, with vesting and
performance terms similar to those applicable to similarly situated executives of Nuance, subject to any
stub period as the equity grant cycles of Microsoft and Nuance are harmonized; and
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Mr. Benjamin will be granted an on-hire performance stock award for shares of Microsoft common stock,
which will be eligible to vest between 0% and 200% of target based on the achievement of performance
goals over four performance periods ending June 30, 2025. The number of shares underlying such award
will be equal to $15,000,000 divided by Microsoft’s closing stock price as of the closing date.
The letter agreements also amend Mr. Benjamin’s employment agreement and Mr. Tempesta’s change of control and
severance agreement, as follows:
•
The employment and change of control and severance agreements will remain in effect until the third
anniversary of the effective time, unless earlier terminated in accordance with their terms;
•
The “good reason” definitions in the employment and change of control severance agreements will be
modified, including to provide that the executives will not be considered to have an adverse change in
duties or responsibilities that would constitute “good reason” solely by reason of the merger or Nuance
becoming a subsidiary of Microsoft. Instead:
○
Mr. Benjamin will have “good reason” if he ceases to run the Nuance business unit reporting directly
to Mr. Guthrie or his successor, as such business unit evolves based on Microsoft’s additions to or
subtractions from the business unit from time to time; and
○
Mr. Tempesta will have “good reason” if he is assigned duties and responsibilities that, in the
aggregate, are materially inconsistent with being a chief financial officer of an operating business of a
public company or if he ceases to report directly to Mr. Benjamin or his successor;
•
Any equity awards granted to either executive after the date of the letter agreement will not be subject to
the accelerated vesting provisions of the employment or change of control severance agreement;
•
Each executive will receive the severance payments and benefits provided under the employment or change
of control severance agreement, and full vesting of the equity awards granted to each executive before the
date of the letter agreement on any of the following terminations of employment,:
○
if at any time on or following the effective time, the executive’s employment is terminated by Microsoft
without “cause” (as defined in Microsoft’s Senior Executive Severance Plan) or terminates due to the
executive’s death or disability;
○
if on or within 12 months after the effective time, the executive resigns for “good reason” (as modified
pursuant to the letter agreement); or
○
if between the 12-month and three-year anniversaries of the effective time, the executive resigns for
any reason.
•
Following the third anniversary of the effective time, each executive will be eligible to participate in
Microsoft’s severance plan applicable to similarly situated employees of Microsoft.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the estimated amounts of the payments
and benefits that each named executive officer of Nuance would have received in connection with the merger,
assuming the merger closed on May 14, 2021 and, immediately thereafter, the employment of the named executive
officer was terminated by the company without “cause” or the named executive officer resigned for “good reason”
(each such term, as defined in the applicable agreement with the named executive officer). This compensation is
subject to an advisory vote of Nuance’s stockholders, as described below under the section entitled “Proposal 2:
Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements” beginning on page 77.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The calculations in the tables below do not include any new Nuance equity awards or special bonuses that may be
granted to the named executive officers before the merger closes. In addition to the assumptions regarding the
closing date of the merger and termination of the employment of the named executive officers, these estimates are
based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the tables below. Accordingly,
the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the
amounts set forth below.

Cash. The amounts in this column reflect the value of the cash severance payments payable to each named executive officer and,
for Mr. Benjamin, a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination. For Mr. Benjamin, his severance is equal to the sum of
250% of his annual base salary plus 200% of his target bonus. For the other named executive officers, the severance is equal to
100% of the officer’s base salary and target bonus for the year of termination (or, if greater, the target bonus for the year of the
merger). The breakdown of the amounts in this column for Mr. Benjamin are $4,400,000 for severance and $743,014 for
prorated annual bonus. The severance and prorated bonus payments are all “double trigger” in nature, which means that payment
of these amounts is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or within the 12 months following the merger
(except for Mr. Benjamin, upon a qualifying termination of employment three months prior to or within 12 months following
the merger).
(2)
Equity. The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate values of the accelerated vesting of the Rollover RSUs. These amounts
are “double trigger” in nature, which means that the accelerated vesting is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of
employment on or after the merger (except for Mr. Benjamin, upon a qualifying termination of employment three months prior
to or within 12 months following the merger). In connection with the merger, Mr. Benjamin will be entitled to receive a
Microsoft equity award with a number of shares underlying such award equal to $15,000,000, divided by Microsoft's closing stock
price as of the closing date, as described above under “New Arrangements with Microsoft”. The equity award will be eligible to
vest between 0% and 200% of target based on the achievement of performance goals over four performance periods ending June
30, 2025, but this award does not provide for acceleration upon any termination of Mr. Benjamin’s employment and is not
included in this table.
(3)
Perquisites/Benefits. The amounts in this column reflect the value of continued company-paid health insurance coverage for 12
months (except for Mr. Benjamin, coverage for 18 months). The amounts in this column are “double trigger” in nature, which
means that payment of these amounts is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or within the 12 months
following the merger (except for Mr. Benjamin, upon a qualifying termination of employment three months prior to or within
12 months following the merger).
Financing of the Merger
The merger is not conditioned on Microsoft’s ability to obtain financing. Microsoft has represented to Nuance that it
has available and will have available at the effective time the funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger
consideration, including (i) payments to Nuance’s stockholders of the amounts due under the merger agreement and
(ii) payments in respect of certain of Nuance’s outstanding equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S.
holders (each as defined below) of Nuance common stock who hold their stock as a capital asset within the meaning
of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which we refer to as the Code. This summary is based on the
Code, the U.S. Treasury Department regulations issued under the Code, which we refer to as the Treasury
Regulations, and administrative rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, all of
which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary is not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, or a court and there can be no assurance that the tax consequences
described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that they would be sustained by a court if so
challenged. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Nuance common stock that is for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or
other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in gross
income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if (A) a court within the United
States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) the trust has a
valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. A “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Nuance common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This summary is not a complete description of all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and, in
particular, may not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of Nuance common stock
who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law including, for example, partnerships (or an
entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and partners therein, financial
institutions, dealers in securities, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, mutual funds, real estate investment
trusts, personal holding companies, regulated investment companies, securities or currency dealers, traders in
securities who elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting, non-U.S. holders that hold, directly or
constructively (or that held, directly or constructively, at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of
the merger), 5% or more of the outstanding Nuance common stock, tax-exempt investors, S corporations or other
pass-through entities, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-deferred or other retirement
accounts, U.S. expatriates, former long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired Nuance common
stock pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option or right or otherwise as compensation, and holders who
hold Nuance common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, or other
integrated investment. Also, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to
holders of Nuance common stock who exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law. In addition, no information is
provided with respect to the tax consequences of the merger under any U.S. federal law other than income tax laws
(including, for example the U.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare, and alternative minimum tax laws), or any applicable
state, local, or foreign tax laws. This summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than
the merger.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Nuance common stock,
the tax treatment of a partner in such a partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. Any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds
Nuance common stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult their own independent tax advisors
regarding the tax consequences of the merger to their specific circumstances.
The tax consequences of the merger will depend on a holder’s specific situation. Holders should consult their tax
advisor as to the tax consequences of the merger relevant to their particular circumstances, including the
applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes
in those laws.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder
who receives cash in exchange for shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize capital gain
or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the merger and (ii) the
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Nuance common stock exchanged therefor.
A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Nuance common stock will generally equal the price the U.S. holder
paid for such shares. If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Nuance common stock surrendered in the
merger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss.
Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal
income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject to limitations.
If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Nuance common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S.
holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Nuance
common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain, if any, on such shares of Nuance common stock is effectively connected with a trade or business
of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment in the United States) in which case such gain
will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates applicable to U.S. holders and, if such non-U.S.
holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or
lower applicable treaty rate); or
•
the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
exchange of shares of Nuance common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger and
certain other conditions are met, in which case the gain, if any, on such shares of Nuance common stock
will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) and such gain may be offset by U.S.
source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments of cash to a U.S. holder of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger may, under certain circumstances,
be subject to backup withholding, unless the holder furnishes its taxpayer identification number, certifies that the
number is correct, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain
holders (such as corporations and non-U.S. holders) are exempt from backup withholding. Cash received in the
merger will also be subject to information reporting unless an exemption applies.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the
required information to the IRS in a timely manner. Non-U.S. holders may be required to comply with certification
requirements and identification procedures in order to establish an exemption from information reporting and backup
withholding.
The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above are not intended to constitute a complete description of
all tax consequences relating to the merger. Holders of Nuance common stock are urged to consult their own tax
advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the merger in their particular circumstances, including the
applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes
in those laws.
Regulatory Approvals
General
Nuance and Microsoft have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory filing and
notification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required or recommended to consummate the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These approvals include approval under, or
notifications pursuant to, the HSR Act and the competition laws of the European Union and any relevant European
Union Member States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
In addition, each of Nuance and Microsoft have agreed to (1) cooperate and coordinate with each other to make such
filings; (2) use its reasonable best efforts to supply the other with any information that may be required in order to
make such filings; (3) use its reasonable best efforts to supply any additional information that reasonably may be
requested to obtain regulatory approvals; (4) use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to obtain
regulatory approvals as soon as practicable; and (5) provide notice to the other party if it plans to participate in any
material meeting or substantive conversation with respect to the merger.
If and to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the merger, Microsoft, Sub and, solely to the extent
requested by Microsoft, Nuance will (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,
products or businesses of Nuance (whether directly or by the disposition of the capital stock or other equity or
voting interest in the entities in which such assets, rights, products or businesses are held); and
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(B) any other restrictions on the activities of the Nuance; and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microsoft is not required to offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or otherwise take any
action with respect to Nuance that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of the operations of Nuance. Microsoft is also not required to offer,
negotiate, commit to, effect or otherwise take any action with respect to its business if taking such action would
reasonably be expected to (1) have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by
Microsoft or (2) have more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft and its
subsidiaries.
HSR Act and Other Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the merger cannot be completed until Nuance and
Microsoft file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission, which we refer to as the “FTC,” and
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the “DOJ,” under the HSR Act and the
applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be
completed until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR
Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The DOJ or the FTC may extend the 30 day
waiting period by issuing a Request for Additional Information and documentary materials (also known as a Second
Request). If either agency issues a Second Request, the waiting period is extended until 30 days after the parties
substantially comply with the request.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and
notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin
the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek
to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
Foreign Competition Laws
Nuance and Microsoft conduct business in Member States of the European Union. Council Regulation (EC) No.
139/2004, as amended, and accompanying regulations allow parties to ask the European Commission to review
mergers and acquisitions that trigger national merger control filing requirements in at least three European Union
Member States. The parties will file such a referral request as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable following
which competent Member States have 15 working days to object to the referral. In the event that there is no such
objection, the transaction will be reviewable by the European Commission and the parties will then file a formal
notification of the merger with the European Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable.
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004, the European Commission has 25 business days from the day
following the date of receipt of a complete notification, which period may be extended to 35 business days under
certain circumstances, in which to consider whether the merger would significantly impede effective competition in
the common market (as defined by European Community regulations) or a substantial part of it, in particular as a
result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position. By the end of that period, the European Commission
must issue a decision either clearing the merger, which may be conditional upon the parties offering suitable
remedies, or opening an in-depth “Phase II” investigation. A Phase II investigation lasts for 90 business days, which
may be extended by an additional 35 business days under certain circumstances. At the end of the Phase II
investigation the European Commission may either unconditionally approve the merger, conditionally approve the
merger subject to remedies or prohibit the merger if no adequate remedies have been proposed by Microsoft. The
merger cannot be completed during the European Commission’s review of the merger.
In the event that a competent Member State of the European Union objects to the referral to the European
Commission requested by the parties, the merger agreement contemplates that the necessary clearances, approvals or
decisions under the national competition laws of Austria, Germany, Denmark, Spain and Portugal (to the extent filings
in such jurisdictions are required) will be conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the merger.
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The completion of the merger is also subject to obtaining a favorable outcome from the UK’s Competition and
Markets Authority, which we refer to as the CMA. Such an outcome can take the form of either (i) the CMA
indicating that it has no further questions about the merger in response to a briefing paper submitted by the parties;
or (ii) if a formal notification is made, the CMA approving the merger unconditionally or conditional upon adequate
remedies being offered.
If a formal notification is made, the CMA has 40 business days in which to complete its initial review (Phase I), at the
end of which it must confirm whether it believes that the merger results in a realistic prospect of a substantial
lessening of competition. If so, the merger must be referred to an in-depth review (Phase II), unless adequate
remedies are offered by the parties within 5 working days of the CMA’s Phase I decision. Where Phase I remedies are
offered, the CMA must decide whether to accept the remedies “in principle” within 10 working days of the Phase I
decision and must take a final decision on whether to accept the remedies within 50 working days of the Phase I
decision, subject to a possible 40 working day extension at the CMA’s discretion. If a Phase II investigation is
launched, the CMA has 24 weeks, extendable by up to eight weeks at the CMA’s discretion if it considers there are
special reasons for doing so, to decide if the merger should be prohibited or approved conditional on remedies.
The completion of the merger is also subject to certain notifications and/or approvals in accordance with the
competition laws of Australia. The parties must also observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary
approvals, clearances or consents in the required foreign jurisdictions before completing the merger.
The parties will file merger notifications with the appropriate regulators in each of the required foreign jurisdictions as
promptly as practicable and work cooperatively toward expedited regulatory clearances.
Foreign Direct Investment Laws
Completion of the merger is further subject to receipt of certain other foreign direct investment review approvals,
including notification, clearance and/or expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period in certain specified
countries.
Other Regulatory Approvals
One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it
grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory
process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even
preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain
all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a
substantial period of time between the approval by Nuance stockholders and the completion of the merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these
regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the
merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the
conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT,"TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT
The following summary describes certain material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the
merger agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and
in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement that is
important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger
agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement
(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and
supplemental information agreed to by Nuance, Microsoft and Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the
merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those
generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential
matters disclosed to Microsoft and Sub by Nuance in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the
representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating
contractual risk between Nuance, Microsoft and Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject
to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the
representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in
which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and
warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise. Nuance
stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the
actual state of facts or condition of Nuance, Microsoft or Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the
date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or
warranty may have been included in this proxy statement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the
merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Nuance, Microsoft and Sub, because the
parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the
merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior
notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with
information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding
Nuance, Microsoft, Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and
other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided
elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Nuance and our business.",68,68

terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such
conditions, or such other time agreed to in writing by Microsoft, Nuance and Sub. Concurrently with the closing of
the merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided
under the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger, or at such later time
agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.

At the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of Nuance as the surviving corporation will be
amended and restated in its entirety in the form attached to the merger agreement. The parties will take all necessary
action to ensure that, at the effective time of the merger, the bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, will become the bylaws of the surviving corporation, until thereafter amended.
The parties will take all necessary action to ensure that, effective as of, and immediately following, the effective time
of the merger, the board of directors of the surviving corporation will consist of the directors of Sub as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger, to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the surviving corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The parties will take all
necessary action to ensure that at the effective time of the merger, the officers of the Company as of immediately prior

Conversion of Shares",68,69
"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",Conversion of Shares,"Conversion of Shares
Common Stock
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Nuance common stock (other than shares held by (1)
Nuance as treasury stock; (2) Microsoft, Sub or their respective subsidiaries; and (3) Nuance stockholders who have
properly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under Delaware law with respect to such shares)
will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration (which is
$56.00 per share, without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding taxes).
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock held by (1) Nuance or (2) Microsoft, Sub
or their respective subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.
Treatment of Equity Compensation
Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Nuance common stock in the
form of stock options and stock units. Our executive officers hold RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of
Nuance common stock based on service over a time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to
receive shares of Nuance common stock ranging from 0% to 200% of the target number of shares based on both
service and achievement of performance goals for a specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold
RSUs and DSUs, which represents a right to receive shares of Nuance common stock, subject to vesting
requirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as separation from service. Our
executive officers and non-employee directors do not hold stock options. The merger agreement provides for the
treatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity awards:
Stock Options
Each stock option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration for each share of Nuance common stock
that would have been issuable upon exercise of the option, less the exercise price of the option and any applicable
withholding taxes. If the exercise price of a stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the
option will be cancelled as of the effective time for no consideration.
Stock Units
•
Each award of stock units that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the effective time or that will
become vested by its terms at the effective time and, in each case, by its terms is to be settled upon the
occurrence of vesting or the effective time will, as of the effective time, be deemed to be vested and will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of
Nuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes.
60TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Each outstanding and unvested award of stock units will, as of the effective time, be converted into a
Rollover RSU as follows:
○
Each RSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that is subject to the same time-based vesting
schedule as the RSU.
○
Each PSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that, following the effective time, will vest based
solely on time at the conclusion of the original performance period of the PSU.
○
The number of shares of common stock of Microsoft subject to each Rollover RSU will be equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Nuance shares of common stock
subject to the corresponding RSU or PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by a
specified exchange ratio (see below). The number of Nuance shares of common stock subject to each
PSU immediately prior to the effective time will be determined based on (i) maximum performance, for
any PSU that was subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, and (ii) target
performance, for any PSU that was subject to financial and/or operational performance goals. For each
PSU that is subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, Nuance is currently
performing at a level that would result in maximum performance payout.
○
Notwithstanding the treatment of awards of outstanding and unvested stock units described above,
Microsoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and
converting an award into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of
Nuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes).
•
If the treatment described above of an award of stock units held by a non-U.S. employee would be
prohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the
applicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance), Microsoft will
provide compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have
been provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and as would
not result in the imposition of additional taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. This
compensation will be provided in the form of a cash payment (less any applicable taxes) or a new equity
award, as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance.
•
For purposes of the conversion of Nuance stock units described above, the “exchange ratio” is defined as
a fraction, the numerator of which is the merger consideration and the denominator of which is the volume
weighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above
rounded up) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the
last trading day immediately prior to the closing.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In accordance with the plan terms, each ESPP participant in the current offering period, which began on February 16,
2021, may not increase his or her payroll contribution rate or make separate non-payroll contributions, and no new
participants may enroll in the current offering period. In connection with the transaction with Microsoft, Nuance will
take all actions necessary to provide that:
•
if the closing occurs prior to August 13, 2021, which is the last day of the current offering period:
○
cause the current offering period to terminate no later than five business days prior to the closing
date;
○
make any pro-rata adjustments necessary to reflect the shortened offering period; and
○
cause the exercise (as of no later than one business day before the effective time) of each outstanding
purchase right and apply the funds credited to each participant’s payroll withholding account to the
purchase of whole shares of Nuance common stock;
•
provide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence; and
•
terminate the ESPP in its entirety, effective as of the effective time.

"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",Exchange and Payment Procedures,"Exchange and Payment Procedures
Prior to the closing of the merger, Microsoft will designate a bank or trust company, which we refer to as the “paying
agent,” to make payments of the merger consideration to Nuance stockholders. At or promptly following the effective
time of the merger, Microsoft will deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate per share merger consideration to Nuance stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement.
As soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will send to each
holder of record of shares of common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to
surrender stock certificates and book-entry shares in exchange for the per share merger consideration. Upon receipt
of (1) surrendered certificates (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together with any
required bond) with respect to shares of common stock represented by stock certificates or a customary “agent’s
message” with respect to book-entry shares representing the shares of common stock and (2) a signed letter of
transmittal (in the case of common stock represented by stock certificates) and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive the per share merger
consideration in exchange therefor, without interest. The amount of any per share merger consideration paid to
Nuance stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable
law to be withheld.
If any cash deposited with the paying agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the merger,
such cash will be returned to Microsoft, upon demand, and any stockholders who have not complied with the
exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to Microsoft for satisfaction of their claims for
payment. None of Microsoft, Sub, Nuance, the surviving corporation or the paying agent will be liable to any Nuance
stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has
been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then before such
stockholder will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration, Microsoft or the paying agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the merger consideration, require such stockholder to make
an affidavit of the loss, theft or destruction, and to deliver a bond in such amount as Microsoft or the paying agent
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Microsoft, the surviving corporation or the
paying agent with respect to such certificate.",71,71

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of Nuance, Microsoft and Sub.
Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement made by Nuance are qualified as to “materiality”
or “Company Material Adverse Effect.” For purposes of the merger agreement, “Company Material Adverse Effect”
means, with respect to Nuance, any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, effect or circumstance that, individually or
taken together with all other changes, events, violations, inaccuracies, effects or circumstances that have occurred
prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Company Material Adverse Effect, (a) has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or
results of operations of Nuance and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) would, or would reasonably be expected
to, prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, except that, in the case of the foregoing clause (a) only, none of the following
(by itself or when aggregated) to the extent occurring after the date of the merger agreement will be deemed to be or
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or will be taken into account when determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may, would or could occur:
•
changes in general economic conditions in the United States or any other country or region in the world, or
changes in conditions in the global economy generally (except to the extent that such conditions
disproportionately adversely affect Nuance relative to other companies operating in the industries in which
Nuance and its subsidiaries conduct business, in which case only the incremental disproportionate adverse
impact of such conditions may be taken into account in determining whether there has occurred a Company
Material Adverse Effect);

Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the earlier
termination of the merger agreement), Nuance has agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with and terminate any data room or other diligence access of any person, its affiliates and its
representatives relating to an acquisition transaction (as defined below) and to request any person who executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring Nuance to promptly return or destroy any
non-public information furnished by or on behalf of Nuance prior to the date of the merger agreement.
Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the
merger agreement and the effective time of the merger, Nuance has agreed to not, and to not authorize or direct, as the
case may be, its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to:

agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to an acquisition transaction (as defined
below); or
•
authorize or commit to do any of the above.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Nuance stockholders and after
entering into an acceptable confidentiality agreement, Nuance may furnish information to, and enter into negotiations
or discussions with, a person regarding a bona fide written acquisition proposal if: (1) Nuance, its subsidiaries and its
and their respective representatives have not breached any of the conditions above with respect to the acquisition
proposal or such person; (2) the Nuance Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a superior proposal (as defined below); (3) the Nuance Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable law; and (4) Nuance prior to or contemporaneously makes available to Microsoft any non-
public information concerning Nuance that is provided to such person that was not previously made available to
Microsoft.
If Nuance, its subsidiaries or its or their representatives receives an acquisition proposal or any request for non-
public information in connection with an acquisition proposal at any time prior to the earlier to occur of the
termination of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger, Nuance must promptly (and in all events by
a specified time on the next business day) advise Microsoft of such acquisition proposal or request, including the
identity of the person making or submitting the acquisition proposal or request, the material terms and conditions
thereof, and copies of any written documentation setting forth such terms. Thereafter, Nuance must keep Microsoft
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

Except as described below, and subject to the provisions described below, the Nuance Board of Directors has made
the recommendation that the holders of shares of common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. The merger agreement provides that the Nuance Board of Directors will not effect a company board
recommendation change except as described below.
Prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by stockholders, the Nuance Board of Directors may not (with any
action described in the following being referred to as a “company board recommendation change”):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or
modify, the recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors in a manner adverse to Microsoft;
•
adopt, approve, or recommend an acquisition proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors within 10 business days
following Microsoft’s written request made promptly following the occurrence of a material event or
development relating to or reasonably likely to have a material effect on the merger or the vote by Nuance’s
stockholders at the special meeting (or if the special meeting is scheduled to be held within 10 business
days, then within one business day after Microsoft so requests);
•
take any formal action or make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other
than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Nuance Board
of Directors (or a committee thereof) to Nuance’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Nuance Board
of Directors (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an acquisition
proposal until the close of business on the 10th business day after the commencement of a tender or
exchange offer in connection with such acquisition proposal without such action being considered a
violation of the merger agreement); or
•
fail to include the recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors in this proxy statement.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by stockholders, the
Nuance Board of Directors may, upon compliance with the procedures described below, effect a company board
recommendation change if (1) other than in connection with a bona fide acquisition proposal that constitutes a
superior proposal, there has been an intervening event (as defined below); or (2) Nuance has received a bona fide
written acquisition proposal that the Nuance Board of Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, in each case, if the Nuance Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that a failure to effect
a company board recommendation change would be inconsistent with the Nuance Board of Directors’ fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable law.
The Nuance Board of Directors may effect a company board recommendation change, but may not terminate the
merger agreement, in response to an intervening event if and only if:
•
Nuance has provided prior written notice to Microsoft at least three business days in advance to the effect
that the Nuance Board of Directors has (1) made the determination described above; and (2) resolved to
effect a company board recommendation change pursuant to the merger agreement, which notice must
describe the applicable intervening event in reasonable detail; and
69TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
prior to effecting such company board recommendation change, Nuance and its representatives, during
such three-business day period, must have (1) negotiated with Microsoft and its representatives in good
faith (to the extent that Microsoft requests in writing to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the Nuance Board of Directors no longer determines
in good faith that the failure to make a company board recommendation change in response to such
intervening event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and (2)
provided Microsoft and its representatives with an opportunity to make a presentation to the Nuance
Board of Directors regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent
that Microsoft requests to make such a presentation).
In addition, the Nuance Board of Directors may effect a company board recommendation change or terminate the
merger agreement in response to a bona fide written acquisition proposal that did not result from Nuance’s breach of
its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement, the Nuance Board of Directors has concluded in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal if and only if:
•
the Nuance Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant
to applicable law;
•
Nuance has provided prior written notice to Microsoft at least three business days in advance to the effect
that the Nuance Board of Directors has (1) received a bona fide written acquisition proposal that has not
been withdrawn; (2) concluded in good faith that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior
proposal; and (3) resolved to effect a company board recommendation change or to terminate the merger
agreement, which notice will describe the basis for such company board recommendation change or
termination, including the identity of the person or “group” of persons making such acquisition proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such acquisition proposal; and
•
prior to effecting such company board recommendation change or termination, Nuance and its
representatives, during the three business day notice period described above, have (1) negotiated with
Microsoft and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Microsoft requests in writing to so
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that such
acquisition proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal; and (2) provided Microsoft and its
representatives with an opportunity to make a presentation to the Nuance Board of Directors regarding the
merger agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Microsoft requests to make
such a presentation).
In the event of any material revision to any such bona fide written acquisition proposal described above, Nuance has
also agreed to deliver a new notice to Microsoft and comply with the above procedures with respect to such new
written notice (with the notice period being two business days, except that such notice period shall not shorten the
aforementioned original three-day notice period) and prior to effecting a company board recommendation change or
terminating the merger agreement, at the end of the relevant notice period, the Nuance Board of Directors must have
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that
such bona fide written acquisition proposal is a superior proposal.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means any positive change,
effect, development, circumstance, condition, event or occurrence that (1) as of the date of the merger agreement was

Following the merger, Microsoft will honor all employee plans as in effect immediately prior to the effective time,
which we refer to as the Nuance Plans. However, Microsoft may amend or terminate any such arrangements in
accordance with their terms or if required by law.
During the one-year period following the merger, Microsoft will either:
•
maintain for the benefit of each employee of Nuance who remains employed after the closing, which we
refer to as continuing employees, the Nuance Plans (other than equity-based benefits) at benefit levels that
are, in the aggregate, no less than those in effect at Nuance on the date of the merger agreement, and
provide compensation and benefits to each continuing employee pursuant to the Nuance Plans;
•
provide compensation, benefits and severance payments and benefits (other than equity-based benefits
and individual employment agreements) to each continuing employee that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-
based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such continuing employee immediately
prior to the effective time; or
•
provide some combination of the two options described above such that each continuing employee
receives compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and individual
employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
compensation, benefits and severance payments and benefits (other than equity-based benefits) provided
to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time.
During the one-year period following the merger, each continuing employee’s base compensation and target cash
incentive compensation opportunity, in the aggregate, will not be decreased, and the base compensation for each
continuing employee will not be decreased by more than 10%.
Microsoft has agreed to give credit to continuing employees who, after the merger, participate in employee benefit
plans maintained by Microsoft for all service with Nuance and its subsidiaries before the merger for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits (other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan or post-employment welfare plan). Microsoft will credit each continuing employee with
accrued but unused vacation or paid time off in accordance with Nuance’s vacation or paid time off policies in effect
immediately prior to the merger.
With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Microsoft in which continuing employees are eligible to
participate after the closing, Microsoft has agreed that it will:
•
provide that each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate in each Microsoft plan,
without any waiting period, to the extent that coverage under the Microsoft plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Nuance plan;
•
use reasonable best efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements under any Microsoft plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any continuing employee to be waived for
the continuing employee to the extent waived under the corresponding Nuance plan;
•
cause any eligible expenses incurred by a continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Nuance plan ending on the date that the continuing employee’s
participation in the corresponding Microsoft plan begins to be given full credit under the Microsoft plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to the continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the plan year as if the amounts had been
paid under the Microsoft plan, to the extent credited under the corresponding Nuance plan; and
71TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
credit any continuing employee’s accounts under any Microsoft flexible spending plan with any unused
balance in the continuing employee’s account.
For any continuing employees who terminate employment during the one-year period after the merger, Microsoft will
provide severance payments and benefits to eligible employees in accordance with each such employee’s individual
employment or change in control severance agreement or, if no such agreement exists, in accordance with the
applicable severance policy of Nuance in effect on the date of the merger agreement.

The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving
corporation to) honor and fulfill the obligations of Nuance pursuant to any indemnification agreements between
Nuance, on the one hand, and the current or former directors and officers of Nuance, on the other hand, that are set
forth in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement.
In addition, the merger agreement provides that, during the six year period commencing at the effective time of the
merger, the surviving corporation will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold
harmless each current or former director or officer of Nuance or its subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
from and against all costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any legal
proceeding arising, directly or indirectly, out of or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to (1) any action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, in such indemnified person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of Nuance
or its subsidiaries or other affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission,
occurred prior to, at or after the effective time of the merger); and (2) the merger, as well as any actions taken by
Nuance, Microsoft or Sub with respect thereto. The merger agreement also provides that the surviving corporation
will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by any such indemnified
person in the defense of such legal proceeding.
In addition, without limiting the foregoing, unless Nuance has purchased a “tail” policy prior to the effective time of
the merger (which Nuance may purchase, provided that the premium for such insurance does not exceed 250% of the
aggregate annual premiums currently paid), the merger agreement requires Microsoft to cause the surviving
corporation to maintain, on terms no less advantageous to the indemnified parties, Nuance’s directors’ and officers’
insurance policies for a period of at least six years commencing at the effective time of the merger. Neither Microsoft
nor the surviving corporation will be required to pay premiums for such policy to the extent such premiums exceed,
on an annual basis, 250% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by Nuance, and if the premium for such
insurance coverage would exceed such amount Microsoft shall be obligated to cause the surviving corporation to
obtain the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.

The merger agreement also provides that the indemnified parties are third-party beneficiaries of the indemnification
and insurance provisions in the merger agreement and are entitled to enforce such provisions.

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after
the adoption of the merger agreement by Nuance stockholders, in the following ways:
•
by mutual written agreement of Nuance and Microsoft;
•
by either Nuance or Microsoft if:
•
(1) a permanent injunction or similar order issued by a court or other legal restraint prohibiting
consummation of the merger is in effect, or any action taken by a governmental authority prohibiting
the merger has become final and non-appealable or (2) any statute, regulation or order prohibiting the
merger has been enacted (except that a party may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this
provision if such party’s material breach of any provision of the merger agreement is the primary cause
of the failure of the merger to be consummated by the termination date (as defined below));
•
the merger has not been consummated before 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on January 31, 2022, which we
refer to as the “termination date,” except that (i) if all conditions have been satisfied (other than those
conditions to be satisfied at the time of closing of the merger) or waived (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) by that date but on that date the regulatory condition or injunction condition (solely
with respect to antitrust, competition or foreign investment laws) has not been satisfied, then the
termination date shall automatically be extended to 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on April 30, 2022 and (ii) if
all conditions have been satisfied (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the time of closing of
the merger) or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable

law) by April 30, 2022 but on that date the regulatory condition or injunction condition (solely with
respect to antitrust, competition or foreign investment laws) has not been satisfied, then the
termination date shall automatically be extended to 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on July 31, 2022, but a
party may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such party’s material
breach of any provision of the merger agreement is the primary cause of the failure to consummate the
merger by the termination date;
•
the Nuance stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting (except that a
party may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such party’s material
breach of the merger agreement is the primary cause of the failure to obtain the approval of the
Nuance stockholders at the special meeting);
•
by Nuance if:
•
after a cure period, Microsoft or Sub has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of
its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement,
such that the related closing condition would not be satisfied (but Nuance may not so terminate the
merger agreement if its own breach, failure to perform or comply with the merger agreement or
inaccuracy of its representations and warranties causes the failure of the closing conditions in respect
of Nuance’s performance of its covenants or accuracy of its representations and warranties to have
been satisfied);
•
prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Nuance stockholders, (1) Nuance has received a
superior proposal; (2) the Nuance Board of Directors has authorized Nuance to enter into an
agreement to consummate the transaction contemplated by such superior proposal; (3) Nuance pays
Microsoft a $515 million termination fee; and (4) Nuance has complied with its non-solicitation
obligations under the merger agreement;
•
by Microsoft if:
•
after a cure period, Nuance has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the
related closing condition would not be satisfied (but Microsoft may not so terminate the merger
agreement if its own breach, failure to perform or comply with the merger agreement or inaccuracy of
its representations and warranties causes the failure of the closing conditions in respect of
Microsoft’s performance of its covenants or accuracy of its representations and warranties to have
been satisfied); or
•
the Nuance Board of Directors has effected a company board recommendation change.
In the event that the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the merger agreement
will be of no further force or effect without liability of any party to the other parties (or their representatives), as
applicable, except certain sections of the merger agreement will survive the termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with their respective terms, including terms relating to termination fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in the merger agreement will relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement. In addition, no termination of the merger
agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any party pursuant to the confidentiality agreement between
Microsoft and Nuance, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the termination of the merger agreement
in accordance with their respective terms.

If the merger agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, Nuance has agreed to pay Microsoft a termination
fee of $515 million.
Microsoft will be entitled to receive the termination fee from Nuance if the merger agreement is terminated:
•
(A) by Microsoft because (1) the merger has not closed as of the termination date and at the time of such
termination, either (x) the special meeting has not yet been held or (y) the closing condition requiring
receipt of regulatory approvals or the closing condition requiring the absence of an order by a
governmental authority prohibiting the merger has not been satisfied, and the primary cause of the
75TABLE OF CONTENTS
failure of either such condition to have been satisfied was a breach of the merger agreement by Nuance, (2)
Nuance has materially breached its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the merger
agreement or (3) Nuance stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting; (B)
following the date of the merger agreement and prior to its termination, an acquisition proposal has been
publicly announced by Nuance; and (C) Nuance enters into an agreement relating to, or consummates, an
acquisition transaction within one year of the termination of the merger agreement (provided that, for
purposes of the termination fee, all references to “15%” in the definition of “acquisition transaction” are
deemed to be references to “50%”);
•
by Microsoft, because the Nuance Board of Directors has effected a company board recommendation
change; or
•
by Nuance, to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal.

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an
advisory non-binding basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable to the named
executive officers of Nuance in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and
Executive Officers of Nuance in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 53.
We are asking our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, a resolution relating to the compensation that will
or may become payable to the named executive officers of Nuance in connection with the merger. The compensation
that may be provided to Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Tempesta pursuant to their letter agreements with Microsoft is not
subject to this advisory, non-binding vote.
The Nuance Board of Directors encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related
compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. The Nuance Board of Directors unanimously
recommends that you vote “FOR” the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Nuance Communications, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the
compensation that will or may become payable to Nuance’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled ‘Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of
Nuance in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation’ in Nuance’s proxy statement for the special meeting.”
Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and, as an advisory vote,
the result will not be binding on Nuance, the Nuance Board of Directors or Microsoft. Further, the underlying plans
and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly,
regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated, our named executive officers will be
entitled to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms
and conditions applicable to those payments.

If the merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote (whether in person or by proxy) in favor of the adoption of
the merger proposal and who properly exercise and perfect their demand for appraisal of their shares and who do not
withdraw such demand or lose their right to appraisal will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger
under Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as Section 262.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and
incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of
record of shares of Nuance common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that
holder’s name. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” or a “holder of shares” are to the
record holder of shares unless otherwise noted. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Nuance common
stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to
cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal
rights. If you hold your shares of Nuance common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to
exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of Nuance common stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the merger proposal;
(ii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time; and (iii) otherwise follow the
procedures set forth in, and do not otherwise withdraw or lose their rights under, Section 262 will be entitled to have
their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive in lieu of the merger
consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be the “fair value” of the
shares of Nuance common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the court
(subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the surviving corporation
pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). Unless the Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the
effective date of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period; provided that, if at any time before the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation
pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment
only on the amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value”
of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and (ii) any interest accrued prior to
the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to
make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal
should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more
than, the same as or less than the $56.00 per share consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement if they
did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal
rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement
constitutes Nuance’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and
the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B. In connection with the merger, any holder
of shares of Nuance’s common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such
holder’s right to do so should review Annex B carefully. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a
timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, assuming our shares
remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time (which we expect to be the
case), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Nuance stockholders who assert
appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of Nuance common stock for which appraisal rights have been
pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Nuance common stock measured in accordance with
subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (ii) the value of the aggregate merger consideration in respect of the
shares of Nuance common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. We
refer to these requirements as

the ownership conditions. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of
shares of Nuance common stock, Nuance believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising appraisal rights, that
stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. A stockholder who loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be
entitled to receive the merger consideration as described in the merger agreement upon surrender of the certificates
that formerly represented such shares of Nuance common stock.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Nuance common stock must fully
comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Nuance a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger
proposal at the special meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the
effective time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the
effective time); and
•
the stockholder (or a beneficial owner of shares on whose behalf the stockholder demanded appraisal) or
the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware requesting a
determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the merger. The
surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
Filing Written Demand",89,90
"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",Filing Written Demand,"Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of Nuance common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Nuance, before
the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s
shares, and that stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal either in person or by proxy. A holder of
shares of Nuance common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written
demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time. A proxy that
is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger proposal,
and it will cause a stockholder to lose the stockholder’s right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered
written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the merger proposal or abstain from voting on the
merger proposal. However, neither voting against the merger proposal nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on
the merger proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of
Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the
merger proposal. A proxy or vote against the merger proposal will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to
make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting will cause the
stockholder to lose its appraisal rights in connection with the merger.
Only a holder of record of shares of Nuance common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Nuance common stock should be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Nuance of the identity of the holder and
state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the merger. If the
shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be
executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as
in a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on
behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that,
in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of record, such as a
brokerage, bank or other nominee, who holds shares of Nuance common stock as nominee or intermediary for others
may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of Nuance common stock held for one or more beneficial owners
while not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the
number of shares of Nuance common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Nuance
common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Nuance common stock
held in the name of the holder of record.

Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of
shares of Nuance common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A beneficial owner of
shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a
petition for appraisal. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The
surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and holders should
not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair values
of shares of Nuance common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Nuance common stock who desire to have
their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware should assume that they will be responsible
for filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in the manner prescribed in
Section 262.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of Nuance common stock who has
complied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of shares held either in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger
proposal and with respect to which Nuance received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of
such shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after
receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
82TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Nuance common stock and a copy thereof is served
upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to
file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders
who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not
been reached. We refer to this below as the verified list. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those
stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The
Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock
certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any
stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the
proceedings. In addition, assuming Nuance common stock remains listed on a national securities exchange
immediately prior to the effective time (which we expect to be the case), the Court of Chancery is required to dismiss
the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of dissenting shares unless one of the ownership conditions is satisfied.
Determination of Fair Value",91,92
"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",Determination of Fair Value,"Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of Nuance common stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware will appraise the “fair value” of the shares of Nuance common stock, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the
amount determined to be the fair value. The appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of
the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. In determining fair value, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in
the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously
requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” Section 262 provides that fair value
is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede &
Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does
not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising
from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements
of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they
would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an
investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is
not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although
Nuance believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of
fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and stockholders should recognize that
such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger
consideration. Neither Nuance nor Microsoft anticipates offering more than the $56.00 per share consideration to any
stockholder of Nuance exercising appraisal rights. Each of Nuance and Microsoft reserves the right to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Nuance common stock is less
than the $56.00 per share consideration.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of shares of Nuance common stock entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may, in its discretion, proceed
to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of
shares of Nuance common stock whose name appears on the verified list and, if such shares are represented by
certificates and if so required, who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of Nuance common stock to the
Delaware Register in Chancery, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such
stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair
value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto.
Payment will be made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
83TABLE OF CONTENTS
uncertificated stock, forthwith, and in the case of holders of shares represented by certificates, upon the surrender to
the surviving corporation of the certificate(s) representing such stock. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may
be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.
Unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded
quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from
time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment;
provided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware enters judgment in the appraisal
proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will
accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving
corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. The costs
of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be
determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in
connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Nuance common stock under Section 262 fails to
perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of Nuance
common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time into the right to receive the merger
consideration less applicable withholding taxes. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the
holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, if
neither of the ownership conditions is satisfied or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written
withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger consideration in accordance with
Section 262.
From and after the effective time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Nuance
common stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except
dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of Nuance common stock, if any, payable to stockholders of
Nuance of record as of a time prior to the effective time; provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed,
or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal
is filed with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed
as to any stockholder of Nuance without the approval of the court; provided that this provision will not affect the
right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party
to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days
after the effective date of the merger.
Failure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory
appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder of Nuance wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to
consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

If the merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any of our
future stockholder meetings. However, if the merger is not completed, Nuance’s stockholders will continue to be
entitled to attend and participate in future Annual Meetings of Stockholders when held. Nuance will hold an Annual
Meeting of Stockholders in 2022 only if the merger has not already been completed, which we refer to as the 2022
annual meeting.
If the 2022 annual meeting is held, stockholders may submit proposals for consideration at our 2022 annual meeting
of stockholders. Proposals of stockholders that are intended to be presented at the 2022 annual meeting must comply
with the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-8. A stockholder’s proposal must be delivered to or mailed and received by us
no later than August 19, 2021 in order for it to be included in Nuance’s proxy statement and form of proxy relating to

Our bylaws require that we be given advance written notice for nominations for directors and proposals of business
that you wish to submit for consideration at our 2022 annual meeting other than those intended to be included in next
year’s proxy statement under SEC Rule 14a-8.
To be timely, a nomination notice and required information must be delivered to or mailed and received by the

received no earlier than the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later
of (i) the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the date on which we publicly announce
the meeting date. Assuming the date of our 2020 annual meeting is not so advanced or delayed, stockholders who
wish to include a director nominee in our 2022 proxy statement must notify us no earlier than July 20, 2021 and no
later than the close of business on August 19, 2021. Such notice must provide the information required by our

business on the 120th day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, or (b) not later than
the close of business on the 45th calendar day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 75th calendar day, prior
to the first anniversary of the date on which we first mailed our proxy materials for the preceding year’s annual

"Nuance Communications, Inc._20210517_DEFM14A_19281720_4221662.Pdf",ANNEX B - SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,"ANNEX B
APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS
DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW
§ 262. Appraisal rights.
(a)
Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a
demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds
such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with
subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor
consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in
subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of
record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant
by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a
corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b)
Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation
in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to §
251(g) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:
(1)
Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed
to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of
immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national
securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving
corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.
(2)
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available
for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are
required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
a.
Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof;
b.
Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares
of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of
the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record
by more than 2,000 holders;
c.
Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or
d.
Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares
or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this
section.
(3)
In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §
253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights
shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4)
Repealed by 82 Laws 2020, ch. 256, § 15.
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
(c)
Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
(d)
Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1)
If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to
be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such
meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to
shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that
appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or
consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand
may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing
system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if
it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the
merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such
action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective
date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each
stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted
in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation
has become effective; or
(2)
If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title,
then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the
surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the
approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of
such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy
of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of
this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in
the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation
of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice,
demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares;
provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to
an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such
demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and
that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such
constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or
consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or
(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or
within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to
§ 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of
this title
B-2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each
stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s
shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the
transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given
shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in
advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,
provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the
record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the
effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
which the notice is given.
(e)
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and
who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in
the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding
as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept
the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any
excluded stock (as defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered
into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s request
for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration
of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is
later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own
name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
(f)
Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the
surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the
Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses
of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the
value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall
be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified
list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the
stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published
in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the
notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by
the surviving or resulting corporation.
(g)
At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this
section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who
have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal
proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the
B-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are
available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all
holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2)
the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares
exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h)
After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the
shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving
corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest
shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore
accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any
stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to
trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined
that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i)
The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the
surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each
such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such
stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.
(j)
The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be
charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
(k)
From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting
corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the
merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then
the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal
proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the
Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however
that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has
B-4
TABLE OF CONTENTS
not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.
(l)
The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders
would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of
authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

The Board of Directors
Nuance Communications, Inc. 
1 Wayside Road
Burlington, Massachusetts 01803
Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Nuance Communications, Inc. (the “Company”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Microsoft Corporation (“Parent”) and Big Sky Merger Sub Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into
the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a subsidiary of Parent
(the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than Owned Company Shares (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) and Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right
to receive $56.00 per share in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more
fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of
the Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that
we deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to
us by management of the Company, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”);
(iii)
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of
the Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Forecasts;
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those
of certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;
(vi)
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the
Merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we
deemed relevant;
(vii)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated April 8, 2021, of the Merger Agreement;
and
(viii) performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to,
discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed
responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further relied upon the
assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Forecasts, we have assumed with your consent
that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and the other
matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based.

the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a subsidiary of Parent
(the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than Owned Company Shares (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) and Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right
to receive $56.00 per share in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more
fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of
the Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that
we deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to
us by management of the Company, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”);
(iii)
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of
the Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Forecasts;
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those
of certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;
(vi)
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the
Merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we
deemed relevant;
(vii)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated April 8, 2021, of the Merger Agreement;
and
(viii) performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to,
discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed
responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further relied upon the
assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Forecasts, we have assumed with your consent
that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and the other
matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based.

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and automatically
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
(b) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Common
Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company
Stockholders who have neither voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in
writing and who have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Company
Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Section 2.7 and instead will entitle the holders thereof to such rights as are granted to such holders by
Section 262 of the DGCL. All Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who have failed
to perfect or who have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(iii).
(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice and copies of any written demands for appraisal,
withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to the Company Stockholders’ demands of
appraisal and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to any
demand for appraisal under the DGCL, including any determination to make any payment to any holder of
Dissenting Company Shares with respect to any of their Dissenting Company

Shares under Section 262(h) of the DGCL prior to the entry of judgment in the Legal Proceedings with
respect to any demand for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals, offer to settle or settle
any such demands or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(a) Surrendered Company Options. Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a “Surrendered Company Option”), will, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock that
would have been issuable upon exercise of such Surrendered Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time less the applicable exercise price for each such share of Company Common Stock under such Surrendered
Company Option and any applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with Section 2.12. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that the exercise price per share under any Surrendered Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, such Surrendered Company Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective
Time without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect.
(b) Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards. Each Company Stock-Based Award that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) that
will become vested by its terms without any action taken by the Company, the Company Board or the
compensation committee of the Company Board upon the occurrence of the Effective Time and, in each case, by
its terms is to be settled upon the occurrence of vesting or the Effective Time (each, a “Surrendered Company
Stock-Based Award”), will, as of the Effective Time, be deemed to be vested and will be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
subject to the Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award, less any applicable withholding Taxes in accordance
with Section 2.12.
(c) Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards. Each Company Stock-Based Award that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award (each, an
“Assumed Company Stock-Based Award”) will, as of the Effective Time, be, as determined by Parent, (x)
assumed by Parent and converted into a stock-based award or (y) converted into a stock-based award granted
pursuant to the Parent Stock Plan (with the terms and conditions relating to vesting to remain the same with
respect to Company Stock-Based Awards subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to Company Stock-
Based Awards subject to performance-based vesting converted into time-based vesting Company Stock-Based
Awards (determined based on (1) maximum performance with respect to Company Stock-Based Awards subject
to relative total shareholder return performance goals and (2) target performance with respect to Company
Stock-Based Awards subject to financial and/or operational performance goals) that shall vest at the conclusion
of the original performance period, it being understood that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
constitute a “change in control” for purposes of the Company Stock Plans and award agreements thereunder),
in respect of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Stock-
Based Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined based on (1) maximum performance with
respect to Company Stock-Based Awards subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals and (2)
target performance with respect to Company Stock-Based Awards subject to financial and/or operational
performance goals) multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. As a result of any such conversion
provided for in clause (y) above, any such Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards shall be subject to all of the
terms and conditions of the Parent Stock Plan and grant agreements for the Assumed Company Stock-Based
Awards (rather than the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan and grant agreements under which the
Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards were originally issued), subject to the foregoing sentence; provided,
that such Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards will be subject to accelerated vesting for qualifying
terminations of employment following the Effective Time, as set forth in Section 5.2(h) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, which in no case will be less favorable than the acceleration provisions, if any, as applied to
such Company Stock-Based Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the Closing Date, Parent may elect to treat some or all Company Stock-Based Awards that would
otherwise be Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards as vested Surrendered Company
A-17TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stock-Based Awards, which will be settled in accordance with Section 2.8(b), but the vesting of such Company
Stock-Based Awards will be fully accelerated prior to such treatment, except that the applicable settlement date
may be delayed to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code.
(d) If the treatment of a non-U.S. Continuing Employee’s Company Stock-Based Award specified in this Section
2.8(c) would otherwise be prohibited, subject to onerous regulatory requirements, or subject to adverse tax
treatment under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Parent in consultation with
the Company), then this Section 2.8(c) shall not apply, and Parent shall provide compensation to the holder of
such Company Stock-Based Award that is equivalent in value to the value described in this Section 2.8(c), to the
extent practicable and as would not result in the imposition of additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code,
in the form of a cash payment which will be reduced by any applicable Taxes or a new equity award, as
reasonably determined by Parent in consultation with the Company.
(e) Parent Actions Related to Assumed Awards. Parent will take such actions as are reasonably necessary, if any,
to reserve for issuance a number of authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise or settlement of the Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, to the extent the Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards are not already registered by Parent under the
Securities Act, Parent will cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a
post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the Securities Act, with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards. Parent will use the
same level of efforts that it uses to maintain the effectiveness of its other registration statements on Form S-8 to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any Assumed Company Stock-Based
Awards remain outstanding.
(f) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation
committee of the Company Board, as applicable, will adopt any resolutions and take any actions within its
authority with respect to the Company Stock Plans and the award agreements thereunder as are reasonably
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.8, including providing notice to each
holder of a Company Option or Company Stock-Based Award in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent of the
treatment of the Company Options or Company Stock-Based Awards set forth in this Agreement. The Company
will provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon (and Parent’s
review and delivery of comments will occur promptly after the Company provides Parent with such drafts and
the Company’s acceptance of Parent’s reasonable comments will not be unreasonably withheld), all notices,
resolutions and other written actions or communications as may be required to give effect to the provisions of
this Section 2.8.
(g) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate amount owed to holders of Surrendered
Company Options and Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, but in no event later than five Business Days following the Closing Date, the
applicable holders of Surrendered Company Options and Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards will
receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll
provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of Surrendered Company Options or
Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or
Section 2.8(b), as applicable. All such payments will be less any applicable withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Surrendered Company Options or Surrendered Company
Stock-Based Awards pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable, cannot be made through the
Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation
will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder
promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more than five Business Days thereafter). All such
payments will be less any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to
be withheld.
(h) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the Company’s Amended and Restated 1995
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as may be amended and/or restated from time to time (the “ESPP”), as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all actions (including obtaining any
necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof
A-18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and, if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP that may be necessary or required under the terms of the
ESPP and applicable Laws) to provide (i) that each individual participating as of the date hereof in the Offering
Period (as defined in the ESPP) that commenced on February 16, 2021 (the “Final Offering”), will not be
permitted to (A) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect when
the Final Offering commenced; or (B) make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the
date of this Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law and (ii) that no new participants may begin
participation in the ESPP after the date hereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof and, if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP that may be necessary or required under the terms of
the ESPP and applicable Laws) necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger, (1) if the Closing
shall occur prior to the end of the Final Offering, cause the Final Offering to be terminated no later than five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date; (2) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the
shortened period of the Final Offering, if applicable, but otherwise treat such shortened Final Offering as a fully
effective and completed Final Offering for all purposes pursuant to the terms of the ESPP; (3) cause the exercise
(as of no later than one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding
purchase right pursuant to the terms of the ESPP; (4) provide that no further Offering Period or purchase period
will commence pursuant to the terms of the ESPP after the date hereof; and (5) immediately prior to and effective
as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the ESPP will terminate in its entirety
and no further rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter. On such exercise date, the
Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the terms of the ESPP within each
participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP.
(i) Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any Company Option or
Company Stock-Based Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of
the Code and that the Company determines prior to the Effective Time is not eligible to be canceled in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such payment will be made at the earliest time
permitted under the applicable Company Option or Company Stock-Based Award that will not trigger a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(a) Paying Agent and Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will enter into a customary agreement
in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company with a paying agent designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the per share Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.7(a)(iii). At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate to
provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments in respect of Company Common Stock
under Section 2.7(a)(iii) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”) in trust for the benefit
of the holders of the Company Common Stock. The Paying Agent will deliver the Merger Consideration to be
issued pursuant to Section 2.7 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in Section 2.7, the Exchange Fund
will not be used for any other purpose.
(b) Exchange Procedures. Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event more than three Business Days thereafter), to each Person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7, (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Common Stock will pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Company Common Stock to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate” and together, the
“Certificates”) or the non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock (“Book-Entry Shares”) in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation to the Paying Agent in the case of a transfer of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by Certificates or receipt by the Paying Agent of an agent’s message in the case of a
transfer of Book-Entry
A-19TABLE OF CONTENTS
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed (in the case of Company Common Stock
represented by Certificates), and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented
by Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in
exchange therefor as promptly as practicable, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock represented
by Certificates and each Book-Entry Share, the amount of Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
pursuant to Section 2.7. The Certificates so surrendered and the Book-Entry Shares of such holders will be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or upon
conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.
(c) Investment of Exchange Fund. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the cash in the Exchange Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more
than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). If (A) there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required
for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7(a)(iii); or (C) all or any
portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Paying Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly
pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7(a)(iii) for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the
Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7(a)(iii). Any income from investment of the
Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(d) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other
than that in which the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred
is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been
paid or are otherwise not payable.
(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Paying
Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior
to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or other
amounts received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing
such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for
payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of

discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such

(a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. Subject to the terms of Section 5.3(b), from the date of this Agreement until
the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the
Company will cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with and terminate any data
room access (or other diligence access) of any Person and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
consultants, agents, representatives and advisors (collectively, “Representatives”) relating to any Acquisition
Transaction. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company will request that each Person (other
than Parent and its Representatives) that has, prior to the date of this Agreement, executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company to promptly return or destroy all non-
public information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement. Subject to the terms
of Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3(d), from the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, executive and other officers will not, and the Company will not authorize or direct any of its

furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub), in any such case
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or

Proposal; (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to making a potential

Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,

Transaction, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”); or (vi) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.
From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive,
any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to the extent necessary to permit a confidential
proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof).
(b) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth in this Section 5.3, from the date of this
Agreement until the Company obtains the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their Representatives (including
the Advisor), following the execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person or its Representatives
(including, for these purposes, sources of financing) that has made or delivered to the Company a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement did not result or arise from a breach of Section
5.3(a), but only if the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (ii) the failure to take the actions contemplated by this
Section 5.3(b) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law. In connection with the
foregoing, the Company will prior to or contemporaneously make available to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives that
was not previously made available to Parent.
(c) No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Except as provided by Section 5.3(d), at no time after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a
committee thereof):

qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent; (B) adopt, approve
or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within 10 Business Days following Parent’s written request made promptly following the occurrence of a
material event or development relating to or reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Merger or the
vote by the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting (or if the Company Stockholder
Meeting is scheduled to be held within 10 Business Days, then within one Business Day after Parent so
requests); (D) take any formal action or make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange
offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood
that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 10th Business Day after the commencement of a
tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being
considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a “Company Board Recommendation
Change”), it being understood that neither (1) the determination in itself by the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) that an
A-45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal nor (2) the delivery
in itself by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(d) will constitute a Company
Board Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.3; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(d) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval:
(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable Law and then if and only if:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three Business Days in advance
to the effect that the Company Board has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i), which notice will describe the
Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, during such three Business Day period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests in writing to so negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board no
longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable Law and (B) provided Parent and its Representatives with an opportunity to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect
thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); or
(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach
of this Section 5.3 and that the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect
a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal or (B) authorize the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:
(1) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant
to applicable Law; and
(2) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three Business Days in
advance (the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board has (A) received a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(ii), which
notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination,
including the identity of the Person or “group” of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice
Period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
requests in writing to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (2)
provided Parent and its Representatives with an opportunity to make a presentation to the Company
Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent
A-46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any
material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(d)(ii)(2) with respect to such
new written notice (with the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice being two Business
Days, provided that such new notice shall in no event shorten the original three Business Day notice
period); and (b) the Company Board, at the end of the Notice Period (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel), must have in good faith reaffirmed its determination that
such bona fide written Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.
(e) Notice. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, by the later of (i)
24 hours from the receipt thereof or (ii) 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the next Business Day) notify Parent if any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or request for non-public information from or any discussions or
negotiations are sought by any third Person, in each case that would be reasonably expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal, is, to the Knowledge of the Company or of any member of the Company Board, received
by the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must include (A) the identity of the Person or
“group” of Persons making such offers or proposals (unless, in each case, such disclosure is prohibited
pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or “group” of Persons that is in effect
on the date of this Agreement); and (B) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such offers or
proposals or if such Acquisition Proposal or request is in writing, a copy thereof. Thereafter, the Company must
keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals
(including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.
(f) Certain Disclosures. So long as the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such disclosure (other than a customary “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act), then nothing in this
Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a “stop, look and
listen” communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication); (ii)
complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (iii) making any
disclosure to the Company Stockholders (including regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) that the Company Board (or a committee thereof), after
consultation with outside counsel, has determined in good faith is required by applicable Law. In addition, so
long as the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
disclosure (other than a customary “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act), then it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board solely that (A)
describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal; (B) identifies the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal; (C) provides the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal; or (D) describes the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed to be (1) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, qualification
or modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (2) an adoption, approval or recommendation with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (3) a Company Board Recommendation Change.
(g) Breach by Representatives. The Company agrees that any action taken by any Representative (other than
any employee or consultant of the Company who is not at the senior vice president level or above or other
officer of the Company) of the Company that, if taken by the Company, would be a breach of this Section 5.3,
then such action will be deemed to constitute a breach by the Company of this Section 5.3.",147,150

therewith.
(b) No Failure to Take Necessary Action. In addition to the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, neither Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will take
any action, or fail to take any action, that is intended to or has (or would reasonably be expected to have) the
effect of (i) preventing or materially impairing or materially delaying or otherwise materially adversely affecting
the consummation of the Merger; or (ii) the ability of such Party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in compliance with Section 5.3 will be

Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and its Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand,

efforts to supply the other (or cause the other to be supplied) with any information that may be required in order

obtain clearance of the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws or Foreign Investment
Laws set forth in Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their
respective Affiliates) will and, solely to the extent requested by Parent, the Company and its Affiliates will: (i)
offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether directly or by the disposition of the capital stock or other equity

other restrictions on the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (ii) contest, defend and appeal any

its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, product lines, assets, permits, operations, rights, or interest

Company Stockholder Meeting on or around the 20th Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company Stockholders or on such other date elected by the Company with Parent’s consent

upon Parent’s reasonable request regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the
dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders. The Company will be permitted to postpone

Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are holders of an insufficient number
of shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting
to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii) the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) (A) that it is required by applicable Law or order to postpone

applicable Law to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that is required by
applicable Law is provided to Company Stockholders with adequate time for review prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting or (C) that such postponement or adjournment is necessary to permit completion of any
pending Notice Period in respect of a Company Board Recommendation Change, (iii) the Company is requested
to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by the SEC or its staff or (iv) with the prior written

the prior written consent of Parent; or (ii) with respect to Section 6.4(b)(i), by more than 30 calendar days after
the date on which the Company Stockholder Meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled without
the prior written consent of Parent. In no event will the record date of the Company Stockholder Meeting be
changed without Parent’s prior written consent. The Company will postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting on one or more occasions if so requested by Parent (but in such case the Company shall
not be required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to a date that is more than 30
calendar days after the date on which the Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled), and will
subsequently hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as practicable after such postponement or

Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to
obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present. Without the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of this
Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to
be voted on by the Company Stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements set
forth on Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter in effect on the date of this Agreement between the
Company, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors and officers, on the other
hand (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and
the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter and the Bylaws as of the date of
this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.8(a), during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements set forth on
Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter with the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in
connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that
such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such
A-52TABLE OF CONTENTS
Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior
to, at or after the Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub with respect thereto, except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Section 6.8(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until
such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving
Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time; (B) each Indemnified
Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the
Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such
Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and
expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be
liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any
of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any
Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such
Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.8(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess
of 250% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage in the last twelve month period ending on April 1,
2021, which amount is set forth on Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (such 250% amount, the
“Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the
Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.8(c), the Company may
(or if Parent requests, the Company will) purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’
liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium. If the Company purchases such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.8.

(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.8 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary
pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of
the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail”
policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party

Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to
in Section 6.8(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.8 will be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the
similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification
agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at law or in
equity).
(f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any
rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification
agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or
agreements.

(a) Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change of control” (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.
(b) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Employee Plans listed on Section 3.20(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, but subject to Section 6.9(c), nothing will require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to continue any Employee Plan, Company Plan or Comparable Plan or
prohibit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such plans in
accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.
(c) Employment; Benefits. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time by taking such actions, if any, as are required by applicable Law. For
a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing
Employee the Employee Plans (other than equity-based benefits, including for all purposes of this Section 6.9(c)
under the ESPP) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Company Plans”) at benefit levels
that are, in the aggregate, no less than those in effect at the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries on the date
of this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee pursuant to such
Company Plans; (ii) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments and benefits (other than equity-
based benefits and, subject to Section 6.9(b), individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee
that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance
payments (other than equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Comparable Plans”); or (iii) provide some
combination of Company Plans and Comparable Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and, subject to Section
6.9(b), individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
compensation, benefits and severance payments and benefits (other than equity-based benefits) provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, base compensation and target
cash incentive compensation opportunity in the aggregate will not be decreased for a period of one year
following the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period; provided that in no
A-54TABLE OF CONTENTS
event will base compensation for any Continuing Employee be decreased by more than 10% during that period.
For Continuing Employees who terminate employment during the one year period following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance payments
and benefits to eligible employees in accordance with the Company’s severance plans, guidelines and practices
as in effect on the date of this Agreement as listed on Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(d) New Plans. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing
Employee at or after the Effective Time, other than with respect to the New Plans listed on Section 6.9(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including service with any company acquired by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent the Company current provides such service credit) prior to the Effective
Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but excluding for purposes
of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or post-employment welfare plan), except that such
service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of benefits. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that coverage
pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any
Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will use reasonable best efforts to cause all waiting periods,
pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents,
to the extent waived under the corresponding Old Plan, and the Surviving Corporation will cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan, to the extent credited under the corresponding Old Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such
Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the
account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following
the Effective Time in accordance with the Company’s vacation or paid time off policies in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

this Section 6.9 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after
the Effective Time; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person.

such termination, either (x) the Company Stockholder Meeting has not yet been held or (y) the condition in
Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) has not been satisfied and the primary cause of the failure of either such

account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company will
concurrently with such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.
(c) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable

occurrence of different events.
(d) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral
part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.

Attention: Jeffrey B. Samuels
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with Section 6.18(c) of the Merger Agreement, entered into on April 11, 2021, by and among Microsoft
Corporation, a Washington corporation (“Microsoft”), Big Sky Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Microsoft (“Merger Sub”), and Nuance Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Nuance”), we have been asked to make certain representations and certifications in connection with the delivery of
the tax opinion described therein (the “Opinion”). This letter is being provided to you pursuant to that agreement.
Except as otherwise provided, all “Section” references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), and all “Treasury Regulations Section” references are to the Treasury regulations promulgated under the
Code. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Opinion.
As used herein, “knowledge of Nuance,” means the actual knowledge of the undersigned, and the knowledge that
the undersigned would have reasonably obtained after due inquiry with respect to the particular matter in question.
The undersigned hereby certifies and represents on behalf of Nuance that, after due inquiry and investigation, the
following facts and representations are true, correct, and complete in all respects as of the date hereof.
1.
The undersigned is familiar with the matters set forth in the Opinion, and has made such investigations of
factual matters as the undersigned deemed reasonably necessary for the purpose of making the representations,
covenants and statements therein.
2.
The facts that are set forth in the section entitled “Background of the Merger and Reasons for the Merger” in
the Registration Statement, which includes the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, as amended or supplemented through the date hereof (the “Form S-4”), insofar as such
facts pertain to Nuance or its representatives, are true, correct and complete in all material respects.
3.
Beginning in the fall of 2017, Nuance initiated a formal process (the “2017 Sale Process”) to evaluate potential
offers for its automotive solutions business, specifically the business that would ultimately be spun off as
Cerence Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Cerence”). The process included the engagement of Evercore Group
L.L.C. (“Evercore”) as a sell side banker. The process resulted in an offer from a third party other than Microsoft
(“Party A”) to acquire 51% of Cerence at a valuation of $1.35 billion. The process was put on hold on or around
March 12, 2018 pending the leadership change at Nuance.
4.
During the summer of 2018, Evercore reengaged previously contacted and new potential investors (the “2018
Sale Process”). In total, considering both the 2017 Sale Process and the 2018 Sale Process, Evercore contacted
41 parties, including Microsoft, in connection with the sale of this business. The 2018 Sale Process resulted in
indications of interest from Party A as well as two other third parties other than Microsoft at valuation levels
deemed insufficient to proceed with a sale.
A-A-1
TABLE OF CONTENTS
5.
In October, 2018, prior to the decision to spin off Nuance’s automotive solutions business, Marc Brown, the
then Global Head of Corporate Development for Microsoft, was contacted regarding a potential minority
investment in Nuance’s automotive solutions business. Then, Marc Brown checked with Microsoft’s relevant
product team internally, and since no one had interest in exploring such investment, Microsoft did not further
pursue investment discussions.
6.
Efforts to sell an equity stake in Cerence highlighted that the valuation attributed to Cerence by the private
market was likely lower than what could be achieved in the public market. By September, 2018, Nuance
management came to believe that separating Cerence via a spin-off would maximize long-term value creation to
Nuance’s shareholders and given the corporate business purposes described below in representation 8.
7.
At a September, 2018 board meeting, the Nuance board directed management to commence work in support of a
request for the Nuance board’s formal approval to proceed with a spin-off of Cerence. Neither the 2017 Sale
Process nor the 2018 Sale Process contemplated a sale of the entire business of Nuance.
8.
The Distribution was undertaken for the following corporate business purposes:
a. Enhanced Strategic and Operational Focus. Following the Distribution, Nuance and Cerence would each
have a more focused business and would be better able to dedicate financial, management and other resources
to their respective areas of strength and differentiation. Each company would pursue growth opportunities and
execute strategic plans best suited to address the distinct market trends and opportunities for its business.
Given that the Cerence business was the only Nuance business primarily focused on the automotive technology
industry, Cerence would be better positioned as an independent company to channel properly and fund
investments and develop partnerships to capitalize on long-term industry trends. Cerence would focus on
automotive technology industry growth areas as well as continued operational excellence. The Nuance board
believed that Cerence’s separation from Nuance would allow Nuance to focus on the core growth opportunities
in the remaining Nuance business.
b. Simplified Organizational Structure and Resources. The Distribution would allow the management of each of
Nuance and Cerence to devote their time and attention to the development and implementation of corporate
strategies and policies that are based on the specific company’s business characteristics. Each company would
be able to adapt faster to customers’ changing needs, address specific market dynamics, target innovation and
investments in select growth areas and accelerate decision-making processes.
c. Distinct and Clear Financial Profiles and Compelling Investment Cases. Investment in one company or the
other may appeal to investors with different goals, interests and concerns. The Distribution would allow
investors to make independent investment decisions with respect to Nuance and Cerence and would result in
greater alignment between the interests of Cerence’s stockholder base and the characteristics of Cerence’s
business, capital structure and financial results.
d. Performance Incentives. The Nuance board believed that the Distribution would enable Cerence to create
incentives for its management and employees that would be more closely tied to its business performance and
stockholder expectations. Cerence’s equity-based compensation arrangements would more closely align the
interests of Cerence’s management and employees with the interests of its stockholders and would increase
Cerence’s ability to attract and retain personnel.
e. Capital Structure. The Distribution would enable each of Nuance and Cerence to leverage its distinct growth
profile and cash flow characteristics to optimize its capital structure and capital allocation strategy.
9.
Following the September, 2018 board meeting, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman Sachs”) was engaged to
advise Nuance along with Evercore. Evercore and Goldman Sachs solicited a pre-spin minority investment in
Cerence from strategic investors and select financial sponsors. It was ultimately decided to proceed with a spin-
off of Cerence to the public with no pre-spin minority investment in Cerence from a strategic investor or financial
sponsor and all discussions with potential minority investors were terminated by November, 2018 and not
resumed for the following reasons: (i) automotive technology peer trading multiples implied a higher public
market valuation for Cerence than that attributed to a controlling equity stake in Cerence by financial sponsors
or strategic investors, (ii) a spin-off could unlock value not then
A-A-2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reflected in the Nuance market valuation and (iii) a spin-off would create a public currency for Nuance to
facilitate management incentives and acquisitions. However, Nuance ultimately sold a 1.8% stake in Cerence on
September 30, 2019 in exchange for fair market value consideration to a non-strategic third-party investor.
10.
The Distribution occurred on October 1, 2019. At that time, (i) Nuance had no plan or intention to approve, or
effect, a transfer of any of its shares after the Distribution and (ii) Nuance had no current plan to redeem or
otherwise repurchase, directly or through any Affiliate, any of its outstanding stock, or rights to acquire stock,
after the Distribution, other than through purchases meeting the requirements of Section 4.05(1)(b) of Revenue
Procedure 96-30 (without regard to the effect of Revenue Procedure 2003-48 on Revenue Procedure 96-30).
11.
To the knowledge of Nuance, at the time of the Distribution there was no plan or intention on the part of any
shareholder of Nuance, and neither the board nor the management of Nuance was aware of any plan or intention
on the part of any particular shareholder of Nuance, to dispose of any Nuance stock, other than in connection
with ordinary market trading.
12.
At no time in the two years prior to the Distribution and for one year following the Distribution did any of
Nuance, any subsidiary in which Nuance owns a fifty percent or greater interest (together with Nuance, the
“Nuance Group”), any of their respective officers or directors, any person acting on behalf of the Nuance Group,
or any person acting with the explicit or implicit permission, of any of the above (other than any person treated
as acting with the implicit permission of Nuance solely in Nuance’s capacity as a shareholder of such person
and solely pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(9)) or, to the knowledge of Nuance, any five-
percent shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(8)) of Nuance or any group of
shareholders together owning five-percent of Nuance, or any person acting on behalf of or with the explicit or
implicit permission of any five-percent Nuance shareholder, reach any agreement, understanding, or
arrangement, or conduct any substantial negotiations, each as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-
7(h)(1), or discussions, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(6), in each case with Microsoft,
any Microsoft officer or director, any five-percent shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-
7(h)(8)) of Microsoft, any group of shareholders together owning five-percent of Microsoft, or otherwise with
any person acting on behalf of Microsoft or any five-percent Microsoft shareholder or any person acting with
the explicit or implicit permission of Microsoft or any five percent Microsoft shareholder, with respect to a
transaction or a proposed transaction pursuant to which any member of the Microsoft Group would (directly or
indirectly) acquire, or have the right to acquire, the stock of Nuance or any interest in the assets that currently
constitute the Nuance business.
13.
At no time since the date of the Distribution has Nuance been a disqualified investment corporation (within the
meaning of Section 355(g)(2) of the Code).
14.
The potential acquisition by Microsoft of the stock of Nuance is not pursuant to an arrangement negotiated or
agreed upon during any period before the Distribution, and no enforceable rights to acquire the stock of Nuance
existed during any period prior to the Distribution.
15.
The total value of Microsoft’s current offer to Nuance as of the date the Nuance board approved the
Transaction was approximately $19.6 billion, computed on a fully-diluted basis, and accounting for payments to
all Nuance equityholders in connection with the Transaction. Microsoft’s current offer reflects a valuation of the
Nuance business that was not, and, in our view, could not have been, expected at the time of the Distribution.

Attention: Jeffrey B. Samuels
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with Section 6.18(d) of the Merger Agreement, entered into on April 11, 2021, by and among Microsoft
Corporation, a Washington corporation (“Microsoft”), Big Sky Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Microsoft (“Merger Sub”), and Nuance Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Nuance”), we have been asked to make certain representations and certifications in connection with the delivery of
the tax opinion described therein (the “Opinion”). This letter is being provided to you pursuant to that agreement.
Except as otherwise provided, all “Section” references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), and all “Treasury Regulations Section” references are to the Treasury regulations promulgated under the
Code. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Opinion.
As used herein, “knowledge of Microsoft,” means the actual knowledge of the undersigned, and the knowledge that
the undersigned would have reasonably obtained after due inquiry with respect to the particular matter in question.
The undersigned hereby certifies and represents on behalf of Microsoft that, after due inquiry and investigation, the
following facts and representations are true, correct, and complete in all respects as of the date hereof.
1.
The undersigned is familiar with the matters set forth in the Opinion, and has made such investigations of
factual matters as the undersigned deemed reasonably necessary for the purpose of making the representations,
covenants and statements therein.
2.
The facts that are set forth in the section entitled “Background of the Merger and Reasons for the Merger” in
the Registration Statement, which includes the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, as amended or supplemented through the date hereof (the “Form S-4”), insofar as such
facts pertain to actions taken or meetings and communications participated in by Microsoft or its
representatives, are true, correct and complete in all material respects.
3.
At no time during the two year period prior to the Distribution, which occurred on October 1, 2019, and at no
time during the one year following the Distribution, did any of Microsoft, any subsidiary in which Microsoft
owns a fifty percent or greater interest (together with Microsoft, the “Microsoft Group”), any of their respective
officers or directors, any person acting on behalf of the Microsoft Group, or any person acting with the explicit
or implicit permission, of any of the above (other than any person treated as acting with the implicit permission
of Microsoft solely in Microsoft’s capacity as a shareholder of such person and solely pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(9)) or, to the knowledge of Microsoft, any five-percent shareholder (as defined in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(8)) of Microsoft or any group of shareholders together owning five-
percent of Microsoft, or any person acting on behalf of or with the explicit or implicit permission of any five-
percent Microsoft shareholder, reach any agreement, understanding, or arrangement, or conduct any substantial
negotiations, each as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(1), or discussions, as defined in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(6), in each case with Nuance, any Nuance officer or director, any five-
percent shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(8)) of Nuance, any group of
shareholders together owning five-percent of Nuance, or otherwise with any person acting on behalf of Nuance
or any five-percent
A-B-1
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Nuance shareholder or any person acting with the explicit or implicit permission of Nuance or any five-percent
Nuance shareholder, with respect to a transaction or a proposed transaction pursuant to which any member of
the Microsoft Group would (directly or indirectly) acquire, or have the right to acquire, the stock of Nuance or
any interest in the assets that currently constitute the Nuance business.
4.
In October, 2018, prior to the decision to spin off Nuance’s automotive solutions business, Marc Brown, the
then Global Head of Corporate Development for Microsoft, was contacted regarding a potential minority
investment in Nuance’s automotive solutions business. Then, Marc Brown checked with Microsoft’s relevant
product team internally, and since no one had interest in exploring such investment, Microsoft did not further
pursue investment discussions.
5.
No member of the Microsoft Group currently owns, or at any time in the past has owned, a one-percent or
greater interest in Nuance, or any of its predecessor entities.
6.
To the knowledge of Microsoft, after due inquiry based on publicly available information and internal schedules
of Microsoft, and based on an analysis of institutional investors, executive officers and directors of Microsoft,
there are no “controlling shareholders” of Microsoft, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-
7(h)(3) other than the persons named on Schedule A hereto.
7.
The potential acquisition by Microsoft of the stock of Nuance is not pursuant to an arrangement negotiated or
agreed upon during any period before the Distribution, and no enforceable rights to acquire the stock of Nuance
existed during any period prior to the Distribution.
8.
Microsoft’s decision to acquire Nuance was motivated by, among other factors, the ongoing strategic
relationship between Microsoft and Nuance, Nuance’s team and businesses, as well as our shared vision to
enhance cloud innovations in healthcare and in other industry verticals. By augmenting the Microsoft’s Cloud
for Healthcare with Nuance’s solutions, as well as the benefit of Nuance’s expertise and relationships with EHR
systems providers, Microsoft will be better able to empower healthcare providers through the power of ambient
clinical intelligence and other Microsoft cloud services. Nuance’s expertise will come together with the breadth
and depth of Microsoft’s cloud to deliver next-generation customer engagement and security solutions.
9.
Members of the Microsoft Group have no current plans to discontinue the active conduct of the Healthcare
Business (i.e., the provision of clinical speech and clinical language understanding solutions) or the Enterprise
Business (the provision of automated customer solutions and services worldwide to aid enterprises with their
customer service and engagement).
10.
The Transaction will be effected pursuant to, and in accordance with, the material terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement and none of the material terms and conditions thereof have been or will be waived or
modified. The facts relating to the Transaction as described in the Opinion and the documents referenced therein
are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
11.
Unless otherwise required by a court of competent jurisdiction, Microsoft will not take (and will not cause its
subsidiaries to take) any position on any U.S. federal, state, or local income or franchise tax return, or any other
tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with any statement or representation set forth in the Opinion or the
treatment of the Transaction described in the Opinion. We understand that Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &
Garrison LLP will rely, without further inquiry, on this representation letter in rendering its opinion in connection
with the Transaction. We will promptly and timely inform you if, after signing this representation letter, we have
reason to believe that any of the facts described herein or any of the representations made in this representation
letter are or have become untrue, incorrect, or incomplete in any respect.
