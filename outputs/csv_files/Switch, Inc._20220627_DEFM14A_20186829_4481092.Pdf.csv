The Proposals
The special meeting of our stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) will be held on August 4, 2022, at 11:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at The Citadel Campus, 1
Superloop Circle, McCarran, Nevada 89434. At the Special Meeting, holders of our shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share
(“Class A common stock”) and Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Class B common stock,” and together with the Class A common
stock, the “common stock”), as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 15, 2022 (the “Record Date”), will be asked to consider
and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the Merger, (2) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid
or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Mergers, and (3) a proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special
Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.
Pursuant to our bylaws and in accordance with Nevada law, only the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought before the
Special Meeting.
As part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, we may determine that the Special Meeting be held solely by means of remote
communication rather than in person. If we take this step, we will announce the decision to do so in advance and provide details on how to
participate in the meeting, via a press release issued by Switch and made available on our website, www.switch.com. We will also file the press
release with the SEC as definitive additional solicitation material. Holders of shares of common stock in “street name” who desire to attend the
meeting are encouraged to contact their brokers and other nominees for instructions on how they may attend.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
All holders of record of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of the Record Date, which was the close of business on June 15,
2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the Special Meeting. Each
stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the Special Meeting for each share of Class A common stock and each
share of Class B common stock that such holder owned as of the Record Date. On the Record Date, there were 150,767,439 shares of Class A
common stock and 94,131,279 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
The presence in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy of our holders of
Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to be cast at the Special Meeting, each voting separately, will constitute a quorum for
purposes of the Special Meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present
for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, we expect that the Special Meeting will
be adjourned to a later date. Pursuant to our bylaws, if a quorum is not present, the stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, present in
person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy, will have the power to
3Table of Contents
adjourn the meeting without notice other than announcement at the meeting. The Special Meeting may also be adjourned for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.
Required Vote
Completion of the Mergers requires approval of the Merger by the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of Class A common stock
and Class B common stock entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately. Each stockholder is entitled to cast one vote on each matter
presented at the Special Meeting for each share of Class A common stock and each share of Class B common stock owned by such stockholder on
the Record Date. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our holders of common stock are entitled to cast rather
than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to vote by proxy or in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote
communication, virtually (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting
against the proposal to approve the Merger.
The approval of the proposal regarding the non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the Mergers, and the approval of the proposal regarding any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger, each requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the Mergers. For the purpose
of each of these proposals, if you fail to vote by proxy or in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote
communication, virtually, or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a
quorum is otherwise present at the Special Meeting. Abstentions, while present for purposes of determining presence of a quorum, are not
considered votes cast and therefore will have no other effect on the outcome of these proposals.
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 4,641,945 shares of Class A
common stock and 24,766,143 shares of Class B common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 3.1% of the voting power of Class A
common stock, 26.3% of the voting power of Class B common stock and 12.0% of the voting power of our common stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the common stock that they own in favor of the
proposal to approve the Merger, in favor of the proposal regarding the non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Mergers and in favor of the proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special
Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.
Proxies; Revocation
Any of our stockholders of record entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its common stock by returning the enclosed proxy card,
authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by appearing and voting at the Special Meeting in person, or, in
the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually. If the shares of common stock that you own are held in
“street name” by your broker, you should instruct your broker on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your broker.
Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by voting again over the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
August 3, 2022, signing and returning another proxy card with a later date,
4
Table of Contents
provided we receive the updated proxy card before the date of the Special Meeting, or voting in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that
the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually. Attendance alone will not be sufficient to revoke a previously authorized
proxy.

Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) delivered its opinion to the special committee of the board of directors of Switch that, as of May 11,
2022 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set
5Table of Contents
forth therein, the $34.25 in cash per share of Switch’s Class A common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the
outstanding shares of Switch’s Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated May 11, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory
services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the special committee in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The
Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Switch’s Class A common stock or any other securities of
Switch should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. The engagement letter between the special committee and Goldman Sachs
provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the announcement of the Merger, at
approximately $47,000,000 all of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger.",13,14

and debt financing, as described below.
Equity Financing
Parent has entered into equity commitment letters with DigitalBridge and IFM GIF, each dated May 11, 2022 (the “equity commitment letters”),
pursuant to which DigitalBridge has committed to directly or indirectly contribute to Parent an aggregate amount in cash equal to $2.895 billion and
IFM GIF has committed to directly or indirectly contribute to Parent an aggregate amount in cash equal to $1.930 billion, in each case,
simultaneously with the closing of the Mergers, which will be used by Parent, together with the Debt Financing as defined and described below,
solely to fund each such fund’s pro rata share of (1) Parent’s payment obligations at the closing of the Mergers under the Merger Agreement,
including payment of the merger consideration and (2) all other fees and expenses of Parent and Parent Merger Sub related to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement which are payable by Parent under the Merger

Agreement (collectively, the “payment obligations”). The equity commitment will be reduced as agreed by the investors under the equity
commitment letters solely in the event Parent does not require all of the funds contemplated by the equity financing with respect to which an
investor has made an equity commitment to satisfy the payment obligations in full at the closing of the Mergers. Funding of the equity commitments
is subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the equity commitment letters, which include (i) the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions precedent to Parent’s obligation to the closing of the Mergers set forth in the Merger Agreement (except those conditions that by their
nature cannot be satisfied except by actions to be taken at the closing, provided that such conditions are actually satisfied or validly waived at the
closing), (ii) the substantially concurrent funding of the initial mortgage loans and the other equity commitments and (iii) the substantially
concurrent consummation of the closing of the Mergers. See “The Mergers — Financing— Equity Financing” for additional information.

of a revolving credit facility of up to $100 million (with the ability to increase up to $150 million) and mortgage loans of up to $5.695 billion (with the
ability to obtain an additional $1 billion of proceeds within two (2) years of closing) (collectively, the “Debt Financing”), which may be used to
consummate the Mergers, refinance existing Company debt, establish any required reserves under the applicable credit facilities and pay related
fees, costs and expenses, to the extent that Parent does not obtain alternative financing, in lieu of such Debt Financing, at or prior to the closing of

Concurrent with the initial public offering of shares of its Class A common stock, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of
October 5, 2017, by and among the Company, Company Ltd. and the members of Company Ltd. party thereto (the “TRA”). The TRA provided for
payment by the Company to members of Company Ltd. party to the TRA and their assignees (the “TRA beneficiaries”) of approximately 85% of the
amount of the calculated tax savings, if any, the Company will realize due to (i) increases in tax basis resulting from the redemption of Company Ltd.
Common Units and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA. Pursuant to its terms, amendment of the TRA
requires the approval of members of Company Ltd. whose rights are attributable to at least 70% of the Company Ltd. Common Units outstanding
(and not held by the Company) immediately after the Company’s initial public offering (as appropriately adjusted for any subsequent changes to the
number of outstanding Company Ltd. Common Units (the “Supermajority Threshold”).
As a result of negotiation by the special committee, on May 11, 2022, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company,
Company Ltd. and members of Company Ltd. satisfying the Supermajority Threshold entered into, which was concurrently publicly filed, an
amendment to the TRA (the “TRA Amendment”). The TRA Amendment establishes that in exchange for the termination of the TRA and all payment
obligations of the Company associated therewith, the members to the TRA (other than the Company) will be entitled to receive a payment in cash
from the Company of $0.37 per Company Ltd. Common Unit (such implied price equating to $5.89 per share of Class A common stock if there were no
reduction in the amount of aggregate accelerated change of control payments required to be made under the then-current terms of the TRA) in
connection with the closing of the Mergers in full satisfaction of the payment obligations to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA. Such payments
will be made by the Company as promptly as practicable following the earlier of (i) the closing of the Mergers (or any other change of control of the
Company (as defined in the TRA)), or (ii) December 31, 2022. This represents a
8Table of Contents
reduction of approximately $1,121 million, which is an approximately 93.72% reduction of the estimated aggregate amount of approximately $1,196
million that would have otherwise been payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA in respect of a change of control of the Company at the
implied price per share of Class A common stock offered by Parent, absent the TRA Amendment. It is a condition of the obligation of Parent and

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we and our subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers and directors, are subject to restrictions on
our ability to solicit any company takeover proposals (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Special Meeting”), including,
among others, restrictions on our ability to furnish to any third parties any non-public information in connection with any company takeover
proposal, or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any company takeover proposal, or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we or our subsidiaries may furnish non-public information to, and engage in discussions or
negotiations with, a third party if we receive an unsolicited bona fide written company takeover proposal from such third party after the date of the
Merger Agreement and that did not result from a breach of our obligations described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Restriction
on Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals,” and our board of directors or the special committee, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that such company takeover proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Restriction on Solicitation of
Company Takeover Proposals”). Under certain circumstances and after following certain procedures and adhering to certain restrictions, we are
permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a superior proposal (subject to payment of the

In addition, under the Merger Agreement, Parent and Parent Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps
necessary to eliminate each and every impediment under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger Agreement does not require Parent or Parent Merger Sub to take or agree to take any action, including
any action contemplated by the foregoing, with respect to any of its affiliates (including any person in which any of its affiliates has any debt or
equity investment and any affiliated or commonly advised investment fund) or any direct or indirect portfolio company (as such term is understood
in the private equity industry) thereof, other than the Company, the Surviving Company, Company Ltd., Surviving Company Ltd. or any of their
respective subsidiaries.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR
Act”) and the rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), which prevent transactions such as the Merger from being
consummated until (i) certain information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the FTC and
(ii) the applicable waiting period is terminated early or expires. Both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report Forms
with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on May 25, 2022. Following discussions between the Company and Parent and the DOJ, Parent
withdrew its Notification and Report Form effective June 24, 2022. Parent plans to refile its Notification and Report Form on June 28, 2022, which will
start a new 30-day waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act, which cannot expire on a Saturday, Sunday or a U.S. federal
holiday. The withdrawal and refiling are standard procedural steps that provide the DOJ with additional time to complete its review of the proposed
Merger. Assuming Parent refiles its Notification and Report Form on June 28, 2022, the new waiting period will expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
July 28, 2022, unless the FTC or the DOJ earlier terminates the waiting period or issues requests for additional information and documentary material
related to the Merger (“Second Requests”). If the FTC or the DOJ issues Second Requests, the waiting period with respect to the Merger will be
extended for an additional period of 30 calendar days, which will begin on the date on which both the Company and Parent have substantially
15
Table of Contents
complied with their respective Second Requests. Complying with Second Requests can take a significant period of time. The Company continues to
anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the second half of 2022, assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the Mergers. In
addition, the Company and Parent made the appropriate applications with the Federal Communications Commission on May 27, 2022, notifications
with each of the Georgia Public Service Commission and Nevada Public Utilities Commission on May 26, 2022 and notifications to the Nevada
Gaming Commission and Michigan Control Gaming Control Board on May 20, 2022. The parties submitted a draft joint voluntary notice to the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement on June 20, 2022. The parties intend to submit a final joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with respect to the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in the coming weeks.
Legal Proceedings Regarding the Mergers and the Transactions Contemplated Thereby (page 82)
As of the filing of this proxy statement, four purported stockholders of the Company filed lawsuits relating to the Merger: Palkon v. Rob Roy et al.,

Action”), and Brown v. Switch, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 22-cv-5360 (S.D.N.Y June 24, 2022) (“Brown Action”). The Palkon Action, O’Dell Action,
Bushansky Action, and Brown Action collectively constitute the “Actions.” The Palkon Action names as defendants our board of directors,
DigitalBridge, IFM Investors Pty Ltd and certain affiliates of the Company, DigitalBridge and IFM Investors Pty Ltd and alleges, among other things,
that our board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in approving the Merger, and that DigitalBridge and IFM Investors Pty Ltd aided and
abetted such breaches. The O’Dell Action, Bushansky Action, and Brown Action name as defendants the Company and our board of directors, and
allege, among other things, that the preliminary Proxy Statement misstates or fails to disclose certain material information in violation of federal
securities laws. The Actions seek, among other relief, an order enjoining the Merger or rescission if the Merger is consummated. The Company
believes that the claims in the Actions are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

Under Nevada Revised Statues Chapter 92A - Mergers, Conversions, Exchanges and Domestications (the “NMA”), under certain circumstances,
stockholders of a Nevada corporation may be entitled to dissent from a transaction and demand payment of the fair value of such stockholder’s
shares in the event of certain corporate actions, including certain mergers. However, holders of Class A common stock do not have such dissenters’
rights.
Shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any stockholder entitled to demand,
and who properly and timely, pursuant to the NMA and a separate notice from the Company demands payment for such shares under the NMA
(“dissenting shares”) will be treated in accordance with the NMA. At the Effective Time, all dissenting shares will be automatically cancelled and will
cease to exist, and holders of dissenting shares will have the right to receive the fair value of the dissenting shares in accordance with the NMA. If
any dissenting stockholder loses its status as dissenter under the NMA, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the date this status was lost,
these shares will be converted into, or will have been deemed to have been converted into at the Effective Time, as applicable, the right to receive
merger consideration (without interest thereon) with respect to that holder’s related Company Ltd. Common Units. For the avoidance of doubt, no
dissenters’ or appraisal rights are available with respect to the Company Ltd. Common Units. A copy of the full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500 is

"Switch, Inc._20220627_DEFM14A_20186829_4481092.Pdf",QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGERS
The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the Special Meeting and the proposed Mergers. These
questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by reference, including the
Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
A:
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of Switch and its subsidiaries, including Company Ltd. and Company Merger Sub, by Parent pursuant
to the Merger Agreement. After the Merger has been approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement
have been satisfied or waived, Parent Merger Sub will be merged with and into Switch, with Switch continuing as the Surviving Company. Promptly
following the Effective Time, Company Merger Sub will merge with and into Company Ltd., with Company Ltd. continuing as the Surviving
Company Ltd. The Mergers will occur at the times provided in the Merger Agreement. For additional information about the Mergers, please review
with your advisors the Merger Agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.
We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document governing the Mergers.
Q:
As a stockholder or a unitholder, what will I receive in the Merger?
A:
For each outstanding share of Class A common stock that you own immediately prior to the Effective Time, you will receive $34.25 in cash, without
interest. Subject to dissenters’ rights, each outstanding share of Class B common stock will be cancelled and for each related outstanding Company
Ltd. Common Unit that you own immediately prior to the LLC Merger Effective Time, you will receive $34.25 in cash, without interest.
Q:
Will I receive dividends with respect to the common stock that I own?
A:
During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we paid a cash dividend in the aggregate of $0.0525 per share of common stock to stockholders of record
at the quarterly record date. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to the restrictions set forth therein, we may declare or pay any
regular cash dividends of up to $0.07 per share quarterly, with usual declaration, record and payment dates in accordance with past dividend
practice, to the holders of our common stock during the term of the Merger Agreement without reducing the merger consideration to be paid to
you.
Q:
When do you expect the Mergers to be completed?
A:
If our stockholders vote to approve the Merger, and assuming that the other conditions to the Mergers are satisfied or waived, it is anticipated that
the Mergers will be completed in the second half of 2022. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the closing of the Mergers will take place on (1) the
fifth (5th) business day after receiving stockholder approval if all other closing conditions were satisfied on the date that is five (5) business days
prior to the scheduled date of the Special Meeting and are satisfied at such time, (2) in all circumstances other than described in prong (1), the tenth
(10th) business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Mergers described under “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the
Mergers” (other than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied or waived at the closing of the Mergers, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or (3) at such other date as mutually agreed to by the parties to the Merger Agreement. Unless extended
by mutual agreement, the Merger Agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement if the Merger has not been consummated on or
prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date six months after the date the Merger Agreement was signed (subject
18Table of Contents
to certain limitations and available extensions and remedies). For further information regarding the timing of the closing of the Mergers, see “The
Merger Agreement — Effective Times; Closing Date.”
Q:
What happens if the Mergers are not completed?
A:
If the Merger is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Mergers are not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any
payment for their shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, Switch will remain a public company, and our shares
of Class A common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE. Upon a termination of the Merger
Agreement, under certain circumstances and pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we will be required to pay Parent the company
termination fee. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay us the parent termination fee upon termination of the Merger
Agreement. For further information regarding the circumstances giving rise to payment of these termination fees, see “The Merger Agreement —
Termination Fees.”
Q:
Will Switch continue to pursue its conversion to a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) now that this merger has been announced?
A:
Yes. Between signing and closing the Mergers, we have agreed not to cause Switch to be treated as a REIT without Parent’s consent, but until the
Mergers are consummated, we will continue to pursue and prepare for conversion to a REIT as previously announced by Switch and described in
Switch’s 2022 annual meeting proxy statement.
Q:
If the Mergers are completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares of common stock?
A:
Following the completion of the Merger, your shares of Class A common stock and Company Ltd. Common Units will automatically be converted
into the right to receive your portion of the merger consideration. Shortly after the Mergers are completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal
describing how you may exchange your shares of Class A common stock and/or Company Ltd. Common Units, as applicable, for the merger
consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from
your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for
the merger consideration.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will be held on August 4, 2022, at 11:00 a.m., Pacific time, at The Citadel Campus, 1 Superloop Circle, McCarran, Nevada 89434.
As part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, we may determine that the Special Meeting be held solely by means of remote
communication rather than in person. If we take this step, we will announce the decision to do so in advance and provide details on how to
participate in the Special Meeting via a press release issued by Switch and made available on our website, www.switch.com.
Q:
Who can vote and attend the Special Meeting?
A:
All holders of record of our common stock as of the Record Date, which was the close of business on June 15, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of
and attend and vote at the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the Special Meeting. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast
one vote on each matter presented at the Special Meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the Record Date.

As part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, we may determine that the Special Meeting be held solely by means of remote
communication rather than in person. If we take this step, we will announce the decision to do so in advance and provide details on how to attend
and participate at the meeting via a press release issued by Switch and made available on our website, www.switch.com.
Q:
What vote of stockholders is required to approve the Merger?
A:
Approval of the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock
entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our
stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to
your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger.
Q:
What vote of stockholders is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
our named executive officers in connection with the Mergers?
A:
Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the Mergers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure
to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have no effect on the
proposal.
Q:
What vote of stockholders is required to approve adjournments of the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of any adjournment of the Special Meeting to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve
the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure to vote your shares
(including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have no effect on the proposal. The
Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the proposal to approve the Merger is approved at the Special Meeting.
Q:
Why is my vote important?
A:
If you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held
by means of remote communication, virtually, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the Special Meeting. In addition,
because the proposal to approve the Merger must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of Class A common
stock and Class B common stock entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately, your failure to authorize your proxy or voting instructions
or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of the Merger.
Q:
How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Switch’s common stock?
A:
The merger consideration of $34.25 per share represents a premium over the closing price of our shares of Class A common stock of $30.75 per
share on May 10, 2022, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the Merger Agreement.
Q:
How does our board of directors and special committee recommend that I vote?
A:
Our board of directors and the special committee recommend that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger, “FOR” the proposal to
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may
20
Table of Contents
be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Mergers, and “FOR” the proposal to approve any adjournment
of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.
Q:
What is the special committee?
A:
In connection with its consideration of the matters described in this proxy statement, our board of directors established the special committee. The
special committee, as currently constituted, is composed of Bryan Wolf, Liane Pelletier, Kim Sheehy and Jason Genrich, none of whom is party to
the TRA or affiliated with TRA beneficiaries, and each of whom is independent of management. The special committee was established for the
purpose of considering, investigating, evaluating, analyzing, negotiating and making recommendations to our board of directors in connection with
any potential strategic transactions and the TRA. For more information on the actions and determinations of our board of directors and the special
committee in connection with their consideration of the Merger Agreement and the Mergers, please see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Mergers—Background of the Mergers.”
After considering various factors described in this proxy statement under the caption, “The Mergers—Recommendation of the Board of Directors
and the Special Committee” and “ —Reasons for the Mergers,” the special committee and our board of directors have each: (1) determined that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Mergers, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
are fair to, and in the best interests of, Switch and its stockholders; and (2) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement. The special committee also recommended that our board of directors approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Mergers.
Q:
What is the TRA and the TRA Amendment?
A:
Concurrent with the initial public offering of shares of its Class A common stock, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as
of October 5, 2017, by and among the Company, Company Ltd. and the members of Company Ltd. party thereto. The TRA provided for payment by
the Company to members of Company Ltd. party to the TRA and their assignees of approximately 85% of the amount of the calculated tax savings,
if any, the Company will realize due to (i) increases in tax basis resulting from the redemption of Company Ltd. Common Units and (ii) certain other
tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA. Amendment of the TRA requires the approval of members of Company Ltd. satisfying
the Supermajority Threshold.
As a result of negotiation by the special committee, concurrent with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Company Ltd. and
members of Company Ltd. satisfying the Supermajority Threshold executed the TRA Amendment. The TRA Amendment establishes that in
exchange for the termination of the TRA and all rights associated therewith, the parties to the TRA (other than the Company) will be entitled to
receive a payment in cash from the Company of $0.37 per Company Ltd. Common Unit (such implied price equating to $5.89 per share of Class A
common stock if there were no reduction in the amount of aggregate accelerated change of control payments required to be made under the then-
current terms of the TRA) in connection with the closing of the Mergers in full satisfaction of the payment obligations to the TRA beneficiaries
under the TRA. Such payments will be made by the Company as promptly as practicable following the earlier of (i) the closing of the Mergers (or
any other change of control of the Company (as defined in the TRA)), or (ii) December 31, 2022. This represents a reduction of approximately $1,121
million, which is an approximately 93.72% reduction of the estimated aggregate amount of approximately $1,196 million that would have otherwise
been payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA in respect of a change of control of the Company at the implied price per share of Class A
common stock offered by Parent, absent the TRA Amendment. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Mergers—Amendment to the Tax Receivable Agreement.”

Q:
Do any of Switch’s directors and executive officers have any interest in the Mergers that is different than mine?
A:
Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the Mergers that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
generally, including accelerated vesting of outstanding Switch equity awards, potential severance benefits, benefits under the TRA Amendment,
the Land Purchase Agreement and the Rollover Agreements and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage. See “The Mergers —
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” for additional information about interests that our directors and
executive officers have in the Mergers that are different than yours.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the annexes attached to this proxy statement, please
vote your shares of common stock or authorize a proxy to vote your shares of common stock in one of the ways described below as soon as
possible. You will be entitled to one vote for each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock that you owned as of the Record
Date.
Q:
How do I cast my vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record on the Record Date, you may vote at the Special Meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares at the Special
Meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed,
postage-paid envelope, or, if you prefer, by following the instructions on your proxy card for telephonic or Internet proxy authorization. If the
telephone or Internet option is available to you, we strongly encourage you to use it because it is faster and less costly. Registered stockholders
can transmit their voting instructions by telephone by calling 1-866-697-7125 or on the Internet at www.proxypush.com/SWCH. Telephone and
Internet proxy authorization are available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day immediately prior to the Special Meeting. Have your
proxy card with you if you are going to authorize your proxy by telephone or through the Internet. To authorize your proxy by mail, please complete
sign, date and mail your proxy card in the envelope provided. If you attend the Special Meeting, you may request a ballot when you arrive.
Q:
How do I cast my vote if my shares of common stock are held of record in “street name”?
A:
If you own shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in
accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, since brokers, banks and
other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement. If you have not
received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee,
who can give you directions on how to vote your common stock. If you hold your shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee
and wish to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually,
you must obtain a “legal proxy,” executed in your favor, from the broker, bank or other nominee (which may take several days).
Q:
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?
A:
With respect to the proposal to approve the Merger, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote in person, or, in the event that the Special
Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to give voting
instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger.
22
Table of Contents
With respect to the proposal regarding the non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the Mergers and the proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast
your vote in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy or if you hold your
shares in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such
proposals, assuming a quorum is otherwise present at the Special Meeting.
Q:
How will proxy holders vote my common stock?
A:
If you properly authorize a proxy prior to the Special Meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct. If you properly authorize a
proxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares of common stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger, “FOR” the
proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the Mergers, and “FOR” the proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger. Pursuant to our bylaws and consistent with applicable law,
only the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought before the Special Meeting.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Class A common stock before the Special Meeting?
A:
If you held shares of Class A common stock on the Record Date but transfer them prior to the Effective Time, you will retain your right to vote at
the Special Meeting, but not the right to receive the merger consideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when the
Merger becomes effective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares of Class A common stock you previously owned.
Q:
Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the Record Date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it is
exercised by voting again over the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on August 3, 2022, signing and returning another proxy
card with a later date, provided we receive the updated proxy card before the date of the Special Meeting, or voting in person at the Special
Meeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually. Attendance at the meeting will not, in itself,
constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you have instructed a broker to vote your shares, the foregoing options for changing
your vote do not apply and instead you must follow the applicable instructions received from such broker to change your vote.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?
A:
If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “The Mergers — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” on page 76 of this proxy statement), the
exchange of your shares of our common stock for merger consideration (including any amounts required to be withheld for tax purposes) pursuant
to the Merger will generally require you to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of merger consideration you receive pursuant to the Merger (including any amounts required to be withheld for tax purposes)
and your adjusted tax basis in such surrendered shares. A non-U.S. holder (as defined in “The Mergers — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences” on page 76 of this proxy statement) will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of such
non-U.S. holder’s shares of our common stock for merger consideration in the Merger unless such non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the
United States or we are, or were during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. Because particular circumstances may differ,
we recommend you consult your tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income
23
Table of Contents
tax consequences to you of the Merger in light of your particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, or
foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided in “The Mergers —
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” on page 76 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What rights do I have if I oppose the Merger?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record on the Record Date, you can vote against the proposal to approve the Merger. Only holders of our Class B
common stock are entitled to exercise any dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the Merger to receive the
fair value of the stockholder’s shares as provided under the NMA. See “Dissenters’ Rights.” A copy of the full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500 is
included as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of dissenters’ rights set forth in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500. Failure to follow the procedures set forth in NRS
92A.300 to 92A.500 will result in the forfeiture of dissenter’s rights.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the Special Meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed
with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
Q:
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the Special Meeting?
A:
If you are unable to attend the meeting in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, we
encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the
Internet.
As part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, we may determine that the Special Meeting be held solely by means of remote
communication rather than in person. If we take this step, we will announce the decision to do so in advance and provide details on how to attend
and participate in the Special Meeting via a press release issued by Switch and made available on our website, www.switch.com.
Q:
Have any stockholders already agreed to approve the Merger?
A:
Yes. Our directors, executive officers and entities affiliated with Elliott Investment Management L.P. have executed Voting and Support Agreements,
agreeing to vote the shares of common stock that they own in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger.
Q:
Where can I find more information about Switch?
A:
We file certain information with the SEC. You may read and copy this information at the SEC’s public reference facilities. You may call the SEC at 1-
800-SEC-0330 for information about these facilities. This information is also available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at

proxy statement or any other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC. You can also request copies of these documents from us. See

Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
We will bear the full cost of solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting unless the Mergers are not consummated by the End Date and the
Merger Agreement is terminated, in which case Parent will pay 50% of all printing and dissemination costs for the Proxy Statement. Our board of
directors is soliciting your proxy on our behalf. In addition to the use of mails, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile,
e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees. We have engaged

PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE MERGER
We are asking our stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve the Merger of Parent Merger Sub with and into Switch.
For detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Mergers and the Merger Agreement throughout this proxy statement,
including the information set forth in the sections entitled “The Mergers” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement.
Approval of the proposal to approve the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B
common stock entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the
Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 1, your shares of common stock
will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors, which is “FOR” this Proposal 1. Because the required vote for this
proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your
shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting
“AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger.
Approval of this proposal is a condition to the completion of the Mergers. In the event this proposal is not approved, the Mergers cannot be completed
and the Merger Agreement may be terminated.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors and the Special Committee
Our board of directors and the special committee recommend that our stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger.

PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, we are asking our
stockholders to vote at the Special Meeting on an advisory basis regarding the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the Mergers. Information intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K concerning this compensation,
subject to certain assumptions described therein, is presented in the section entitled “The Mergers — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Mergers — Quantification of Payments and Benefits.”
The stockholder vote on executive compensation is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our board of directors. Further, the underlying
arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory
vote, if the Mergers are completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the Mergers, in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation. Approval of this
proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Mergers.
We are asking our common stockholders to vote “FOR” the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Switch, Inc. (“Switch”) approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the named executive officers of Switch in connection with the Mergers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K
under the heading “The Mergers — the Company’s Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Mergers” to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers beginning on page 73 (which disclosure includes
the table required pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”
Adoption of the above resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. If you
properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST”
or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 2, your shares of common stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors, which
is “FOR” this Proposal 2. An abstention (which will count as present for purposes of determining presence of a quorum) or failure to vote on this
proposal (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) will have no effect on the approval of this proposal,
assuming a quorum is otherwise present at the Special Meeting.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Mergers.

PROPOSAL TO APPROVE ADJOURNMENT OF THE MEETING
We are asking our stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve any adjournments of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies
if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.
Approval of the proposal to approve any such adjournment of the Special Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the
proposal. Approval of this proposal is a not a condition to the completion of the Mergers. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or
through the Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 3, your shares of
common stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors, which is “FOR” this Proposal 3. An abstention (which
will count as present for purposes of determining presence of a quorum) or failure to vote on this proposal (including failure to give voting instructions to
your broker, bank or other nominee) will have no effect on the approval of this proposal, assuming a quorum is otherwise present at the Special Meeting.
Pursuant to our bylaws and Nevada law, if a quorum is not present, the stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, present in person, or, in the
event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy, or the person presiding at the meeting, will have the
power to adjourn the meeting without notice other than announcement at the meeting (subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement, including
that the Special Meeting generally may not be recessed, adjourned or postponed for more than 30 days after the originally scheduled date of the Special
Meeting without Parent’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting
for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.

purposes discussed in this proxy statement and in the accompanying Notice of Special Meeting and any business properly brought before the Special
Meeting. Proxies are solicited to give all stockholders of record an opportunity to vote on matters properly presented at the Special Meeting.
We have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials (the “Notice of Internet Availability”) to most of our stockholders of record, and paper copies of the proxy materials to certain other
stockholders of record. Brokers and other nominees who hold shares on behalf of beneficial owners will be sending their own similar Notice of Internet
Availability. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice of Internet Availability or request
to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. You can find instructions on how to request a printed copy by mail or electronically on the Notice of
Internet Availability and on the website referred to in the Notice of Internet Availability, including an option to request paper copies on an ongoing basis.
On or around June 27, 2022, we intend to make this proxy statement available on the Internet and to commence mailing of the Notice to all stockholders
entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. The purpose of the Special Meeting is for you to consider and vote on the following matters:
1. a proposal to approve the Merger of Parent Merger Sub with and into Switch;
2. a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the Mergers; and
3. a proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the
Special Meeting to approve the Merger.
Pursuant to our bylaws and Nevada law, only the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought before the Special Meeting. The
affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting
separately, is required to approve the Merger and for the Mergers to occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement, which we encourage you to read carefully in its entirety.
As part of our precautions regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19, we may determine that the Special Meeting be held solely by means of remote

Record holders of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of the close of business on June 15, 2022, the record
date for the Special Meeting (the “Record Date”), are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting on all matters to be voted upon. As of the Record Date, there
were 150,767,439 shares of our Class A common stock and 94,131,279 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding. On each matter presented to our
stockholders for vote at the Special Meeting, the holders of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to one vote
per share held as of the Record Date, voting together, except for the proposal to approve the Merger of Parent Merger Sub with and into Switch, for
which the Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be voting as separate classes.

On November 8, 2019 (the “Conversion Date”), at the request of our board of directors, Rob Roy and his affiliated entities, which comprised all holders of
our shares of Class C common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Class C common stock”), converted each share of Class C common stock held by them
into one share of Class B common stock pursuant to our articles of incorporation. Following the Conversion Date, each former holder of a share of Class
C common stock is entitled to one vote instead of ten votes per share on all matters on which holders of Class A common stock and Class B common
stock are entitled to vote. As a result of the conversion, there were no shares of Class C common stock outstanding as of the Record Date.
The current owners of common membership interests of Switch, Ltd. (“Company Ltd. Common Units”) hold shares of Class B common stock on a one-for-
one basis for each Company Ltd. Common Unit held. The shares of Class B common stock (i) confer only voting rights and do not confer any incidents of
economic ownership to the holders thereof and (ii) are forfeited and cancelled, on a one-for-one basis, without consideration, upon the redemption of the
Company Ltd. Common Units for shares of Class A common stock, or cash, at our election. The number of shares of Class B common stock held by a
Member is always equal to the number of Company Ltd. Common Units held by that Member. The exchange of Company Ltd. Common Units and
concurrent forfeiture of shares of the Class B common stock are governed by our articles of incorporation and Company Ltd.’s Fifth Amended and
Restated Operating Agreement (the “Company Ltd. Operating Agreement”), which is discussed in more detail in the “Relationships and Related Party
Transactions” section of our annual proxy statement. Only Founder Members and Non-Founder Members and their permitted transferees may hold
shares of Class B common stock. “Founder Members” refer to Rob Roy, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Non-Founder Members” are
those who hold Company Ltd. Common Units and shares of Class B common stock. “Members” refers to the Founder Members and Non-Founder
Members.

Completion of the Mergers requires approval of the Merger by the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of shares of Class A common stock and
Class B common stock entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately. Each stockholder is entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at
the Special Meeting for each share of common stock owned by such stockholder on the Record Date. Because the required vote for this proposal is
based on the number of votes our holders of common stock are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to vote by proxy or in
person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your
broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting against the proposal to approve the Merger.
The approval of the proposal regarding the non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the Mergers, and the approval of the proposal regarding any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger, each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the Mergers. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if
you fail to vote by proxy or in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or fail to instruct your
broker on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is otherwise present at the meeting.
Abstentions, while present for purposes of determining presence of a quorum, are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no other effect on
the outcome of these proposals.
In order for your shares of common stock to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must either return the enclosed proxy card, authorize your
proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet or vote in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is
held by means of remote communication, virtually.
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 4,641,945 of our shares of Class
A common stock and approximately 24,766,143 of our shares of
34Table of Contents
Class B common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 3.1% of the voting power of Class A common stock, 26.3% of the voting power of Class B
common stock and 12.0% of the voting power of our common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Our directors and executive officers have
executed Voting and Support Agreements, agreeing to vote the shares of common stock that they own in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger, in
favor of the proposal regarding the non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers
in connection with the Mergers and in favor of the proposal to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Special Meeting to approve the Merger.
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Special Meeting, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, will
be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of election for the Special Meeting. The inspector of election will also determine the
number of shares of common stock represented at the Special Meeting, in person, or, in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote
communication, virtually, or by proxy.",42,43

Our board of directors is soliciting proxies for the Special Meeting from our stockholders. We will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from our
stockholders, unless the Mergers are not consummated by the End Date and the Merger Agreement is terminated, in which case, Parent will bear 50% of
all printing and dissemination costs for this proxy statement. We have retained the services of MacKenzie Partners to assist with the solicitation of
proxies in connection with the Special Meeting, and we will pay MacKenzie Partners $25,000 for these services, plus reimbursement of reasonable
expenses. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by delivery of the Notice or proxy statement by mail, we will request that brokers, banks and other
nominees that hold shares of our common stock, which are beneficially owned by our stockholders, send Notices, proxies and proxy materials to those
beneficial owners and secure those beneficial owners’ voting instructions. We will reimburse those record holders for their reasonable expenses. We may
also use several of our regular employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from our stockholders, either personally or by
telephone, Internet, facsimile or special delivery letter.

You may vote by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person, or you may vote by submitting a proxy. The method of voting by proxy differs (1)
depending on whether you are viewing this proxy statement on the Internet or receiving a paper copy and (2) for shares held as a record holder and
shares held in “street name.” If you hold your shares of common stock as a record holder and you are viewing this proxy statement on the Internet, you
may vote by submitting a proxy over the Internet by following the instructions on the website referred to in the Notice previously mailed to you. If you
hold your shares of common stock as a record holder and you are reviewing a paper copy of this proxy statement, you may vote your shares by
completing, dating and signing the proxy card that was included with the proxy statement and promptly returning it in the preaddressed, postage paid
envelope provided to you, or by submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the proxy card.
Stockholders who wish to attend the Special Meeting will be required to present verification of ownership of our common stock, such as a bank or
brokerage firm account statement, and will be required to present a valid government-issued picture identification, such as a driver’s license or passport,
to gain admittance to the Special Meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in
the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you will receive a
Notice from your broker, bank or other nominee that includes instructions on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or nominee will allow you to
deliver your voting
35Table of Contents
instructions over the Internet and may also permit you to vote by telephone. In addition, you may request paper copies of the proxy statement and proxy
card from your broker by following the instructions on the Notice provided by your broker.
Under NYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. A
broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker, trust or other
nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular
proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if you own shares of common stock through a broker,
bank or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card
that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect
to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of
common stock following the directions contained in such voting instruction card. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further
information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares of
common stock. If you hold your shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and wish to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or,
in the event that the Special Meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, you must obtain a “legal proxy,” executed in your favor, from
the broker, bank or other nominee (which may take several days). Because the proposal to approve the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to be cast on the matter, each voting separately, the failure to
provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the
Merger. Because the approval of each of (1) the non-binding, advisory proposal regarding compensation and (2) the proposal to adjourn the Special
Meeting if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal, and because your bank, broker, trust or
other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with
voting instructions will have no effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is otherwise present.
If you vote through the Internet, you should be aware that you may incur costs to access the Internet, such as usage charges from telephone companies
or Internet service providers and that these costs must be borne by you. If you vote by Internet or telephone, then you need not return a written proxy
card by mail.
YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Regardless of whether you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares
of common stock as described above as promptly as possible. If you properly give your proxy and submit it to us in time to vote, one of the individuals
named as your proxy will vote your shares as described below.
All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies (including those submitted electronically, telephonically and in writing)
received before the polls are closed at the Special Meeting, and not revoked or superseded, will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the
instructions indicated on those proxies. If no direction is indicated on a proxy, your shares will be voted as follows: “FOR” the Merger, as described in
the proxy statement, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal, and “FOR” the adjournment of this meeting, if needed, to allow the Company to get
more votes. The proxy gives each of Rob Roy, Thomas Morton and Gabe Nacht discretionary authority to vote your shares in accordance with his best
judgment with respect to all additional matters that might come before the Special Meeting.",43,44

If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the Special Meeting by taking any of the
following actions:
•
delivering to our Secretary a signed written notice of revocation, bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy is
revoked;

The terms of the Merger Agreement and the related ancillary agreements were the result of extensive negotiations between Switch, DigitalBridge and IFM
(on behalf of funds managed or advised by each of DigitalBridge and IFM) and their respective affiliates. The following is a brief description of the
background of the Mergers and related transactions.
Switch’s board of directors (the “board of directors” or the “board”), together with members of senior management of Switch, regularly reviews and
assesses the performance, future growth prospects, business plans and overall strategic direction of Switch, and considers a variety of strategic
alternatives that may be available to Switch, including continuing to pursue its strategy as a standalone company or pursuing potential strategic or
financing transactions with third parties, in each case, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. As part of that review, in August 2021, the board
announced the establishment of a REIT committee of the board to evaluate whether a REIT conversion would enhance Switch’s long-term value creation
strategy. After REIT committee and management consideration, Switch announced in its third quarter 2021 earnings release, and on an earnings
conference call on November 5, 2021, adjusted full year 2021 guidance and that the board unanimously determined to pursue a REIT conversion, targeting
a REIT tax election for the 2023 tax year. Switch Class A common stock closed on November 5, 2021 at $23.06 per share.
Following discussions among the board and management during the second half of 2021, including regarding several publicly traded data center
companies that announced sale transactions, and consistent with the board’s and management’s efforts to maximize stockholder value, the board
authorized management to take preliminary steps to gather information to explore potential strategic transactions (a “Strategic Transaction”). Thereafter,
(i) on November 24, 2021, representatives of Switch met with representatives of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) and (ii) on December 16,
2021, representatives of Switch met with representatives of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), in each case, to discuss the market and
strategic alternatives.
During meetings of the board held on December 9, 2021, attended by management, and on December 16, 2021, attended by management and
representatives from Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham”), outside legal counsel, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the board considered and discussed
initiating a process to evaluate strategic alternatives. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley presented to the board regarding certain strategic alternatives
that could be available to Switch and potential counterparties that could be interested in a Strategic Transaction. Mr. Roy, CEO and founder of Switch,
noted that he had no current plans, nor had he taken any actions, to participate with any bidder in a Strategic Transaction, but wanted to preserve
flexibility if the board determined to engage in a Strategic Transaction and a potential financial buyer wanted Mr. Roy to have a continuing management
role in the surviving entity and/or rollover all or a portion of his Switch equity. Taking this and other considerations into account, the board formed a
special committee of the board (the “special committee”) for the purpose of considering, evaluating, negotiating and making recommendations to the
board for or against any Strategic Transaction. The special committee would comprise of directors who were determined to be (i) independent, (ii) not
current employees of Switch, and (iii) otherwise disinterested in a potential Strategic Transaction. The initial members of the special committee were Don
Snyder, Jason Genrich, Kim Sheehy and Bryan Wolf. Mr. Snyder served as the initial chair of the special committee.
39Table of Contents
Following the December 16, 2021 board meeting, the special committee instructed the board of directors to authorize negotiation of terms of engagement
with each of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors to the special committee in connection with exploring strategic alternatives and
authorized Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to reach out to an agreed list of potential bidders on a confidential basis. Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley were selected, in part, because of (i) their familiarity with Switch, (ii) their reputation as internationally recognized investment banking firms and
(iii) their substantial experience in transactions similar to the Mergers. The special committee also determined that based on fee allocations, only Goldman
Sachs would be asked to provide a fairness opinion in connection with a Strategic Transaction. Switch Class A common stock closed on December 16,
2021 at $26.94 per share. Throughout December of 2021 and January of 2022, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley contacted 16 potential bidders,
including each of DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A and Bidder B, on or about January 11, 2022, to inquire about their interest in entering into a Strategic
Transaction with Switch.
On January 6, 2022, the special committee and representatives from Latham, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and management met, and Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley presented to the special committee regarding certain Strategic Transactions that could be considered.
On January 13 and January 19, 2022, the special committee held additional meetings attended by representatives from Latham, Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley and management. During these meetings, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley presented to the special committee regarding their outreach and
communication with potential counterparties.
During the January 13, 2022 special committee meeting, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reviewed with the special committee Switch’s Tax Receivable
Agreement (the “TRA”). The TRA was entered into in connection with the restructuring undertaken as part of Switch’s initial public offering (“IPO”) in
2017 and contractually commits Switch to pay members of Switch, Ltd. (other than Switch) as of immediately prior to the IPO, 85% of the tax benefits
realized by Switch as the result of the members of Switch, Ltd. exchanging their common units in Switch, Ltd. for Class A common stock in Switch after
the IPO process (the remaining 15% would inure to the benefit of Switch). The special committee, together with its outside advisors and management,
considered Switch’s recorded liability of $359 million as of September 30, 2021 with respect to tax benefit payments owed to TRA members, and that the
TRA required an early termination payment to TRA members upon a change in control, taking into account certain valuation assumptions and the
discounted present value of all tax benefit payments payable to the members under the TRA. The special committee and its advisors discussed the size of
this early termination payment liability and the various terms, assumptions and calculations set forth in the TRA in determining the early termination
payment. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley presented on various actions taken by other public companies with tax receivable agreements that
included early termination payments upon a change in control, including payment in full of the early termination payment, and amendments and waivers
that modified the size or terms of the early termination payment. In addition, the special committee considered that the net present value of the TRA tax
benefits to Switch after a REIT conversion was potentially lower. The special committee, in consultation with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,
reviewed the magnitude of the early termination payment and potential ambiguity in the TRA with respect to determining the early termination payment
under various change in control scenarios and considered the potential for this ambiguity to be disruptive to the transaction process and confuse
bidders or cause bidders to potentially reduce the value they would be willing to pay in a transaction. The special committee, in consultation with
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, further considered that terminating the TRA or having a fixed, certain value of payments under the TRA in
connection with a change in control would be in the best interests of Switch and its stockholders. The special committee and its advisors determined to
conduct further analysis regarding the ability to amend or modify the TRA pursuant to its terms in connection with a change in control, and separately
requested that management conduct its own analysis and report back to the special committee. The special committee acknowledged certain members of
the special committee, board, and management were entitled to payments under the TRA and considered appropriate procedures to address any conflict
of interest as a result.
Over the next month, Latham negotiated and Switch entered into nondisclosure agreements with nine potential bidders, including (i) DigitalBridge on
February 8, 2022, (ii) IFM on February 9, 2022, (iii) Bidder A
40
Table of Contents
on February 4, 2022 and (iv) Bidder B on February 3, 2022. Two additional bidders executed nondisclosure agreements in March of 2022. All 11 of the
nondisclosure agreements included a customary standstill provision
(which did not prohibit the bidders from privately requesting waivers of such provisions). Upon the execution of a nondisclosure agreement, each of the
11 bidders received access to a virtual data room enabling them to conduct due diligence regarding Switch. In addition, each of the nine potential bidders
who executed a nondisclosure agreement in February 2022 attended separate in-person management presentations with Switch during the first several
weeks of February 2022.
Additional board meetings were held on February 2, 2022 and February 4, 2022 with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and
management. During these board meetings, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley updated the board regarding their discussions to date with potential
bidders for a Strategic Transaction and management reviewed with the board bidder presentation materials and prospects and the Switch Projections,
including the material assumptions therein. For a detailed discussion regarding the Switch Projections, please see “—Certain Unaudited Financial
Projections” beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement.
The special committee held a meeting on February 9, 2022 with Latham in attendance to further discuss the TRA in connection with a potential Strategic
Transaction and special committee composition. Prior to the meeting, Mr. Snyder, the sole member of the special committee who was also a TRA member,
elected to recuse himself from the meeting and offered to withdraw from the committee so that no special committee member had any interest in the TRA.
The special committee then discussed the TRA, including the calculation of the early termination payment at various stock prices and the number of TRA
members required to amend the TRA. Following discussion, the special committee recommended to the board that management (i) propose to certain TRA
members holding the rights to the most TRA tax benefit payments that the TRA be terminated upon a change in control without any payments to the TRA
members and (ii) if such TRA members were unwilling to do so, request that they determine a spokesperson and counsel, if they so choose, to negotiate
the terms under which the TRA would be terminated or amended in connection with a change in control or conversion to a REIT. The special committee
also directed management to have Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”), tax advisor to Switch, prepare an analysis of the early termination payment and tax
benefit payments that could be payable under the TRA, including all assumptions underlying the analysis. In addition, given the desire of the special
committee to terminate or modify the TRA to obtain maximum value for stockholders in any Strategic Transaction, the special committee determined to
accept Mr. Snyder’s offer to step off the special committee and proposed that Ms. Pelletier, who had no interest in the TRA, replace Mr. Snyder as a
member of the special committee.
On February 14, 2022, after making a determination that Ms. Pelletier was (i) independent, (ii) not a current employee of Switch, (iii) disinterested in a
Strategic Transaction and (iv) not a party to the TRA, the board, acting by unanimous written consent, approved the replacement of Mr. Snyder with Ms.
Pelletier, and on February 15, 2022, the special committee amended and restated its charter to authorize the special committee to negotiate the termination
of, or amendment to, the TRA and elected Mr. Wolf as the chair of the special committee.
On February 22, 2022, the special committee, along with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham, met to discuss the status of
negotiations with potential bidders. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley updated the special committee on various initial and follow-up meetings held
with the nine potential bidders who had already executed nondisclosure agreements. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley noted that management had
held meetings with the nine potential bidders and continued to respond to diligence requests from the bidders. Following discussion, the special
committee authorized Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to send a process letter to the nine interested bidders, including DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A
and Bidder B, later that day requesting that interested bidders submit initial indicative offers by March 10, 2022.
From February 22, 2022 through March 10, 2022, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continued to engage in discussions with potential bidders,
including two additional bidders who entered the process in early March and mid-March, respectively, with respect to the terms of their potential bids
and management, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham coordinated responses by Switch management to various diligence questions posed
41
Table of Contents
by the bidders, including regarding the status and liability under the TRA. From February 18, 2022 through April 6, 2022, Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley attended diligence calls with management to discuss and coordinate answers by the management team to various diligence questions posed by
the bidders.
On March 10, 2022, Switch received indicative offers from four potential bidders: DigitalBridge at $34.00 per share; IFM, who did not submit a per share
price, but indicated they were willing to invest up to $2.5 billion; Bidder A at $32.50 per share; and Bidder B at a range of $28.00 - $31.00 per share. Each
bid assumed, as directed by Switch, that no payment would be required pursuant to the TRA. Switch Class A common stock price on March 10, 2022
closed at $27.08 per share. Later in the day, the special committee met to discuss the various bids along with Latham, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
After this discussion, the special committee determined to proceed in further discussions with each of the bidders.
On March 14, 2022, the board held a meeting, attended by representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management, to discuss the
indicative offers received to date. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley summarized each bid and presented a proposed timeline for entering into definitive
agreements. The board, Goldman Sachs and management then discussed the Switch Projections, including the material assumptions therein. For a
detailed discussion regarding the Switch Projections, please see “—Certain Unaudited Financial Projections” beginning on page 52 of this proxy
statement.
From late March 2022 through mid-April 2022, management and the board held additional in-person meetings with DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A and
Bidder B, and their respective advisors, including tours of Switch’s various campuses, attended numerous diligence calls with each potential bidder and
continued to populate the virtual data room in response to diligence requests from each potential bidder. During diligence calls in late March, potential
bidders, including DigitalBridge and Bidder A, raised that in order to obtain certain real estate-style financing for the transaction, Switch would need to
amend its leases for certain of its properties in Las Vegas, Nevada.
On March 21, 2022, the media reported that Switch was considering a Strategic Transaction. On March 18, 2022, the last day of trading prior to the
reporting, shares of Switch Class A common stock closed at $28.78 per share. On March 22, 2022, the first full day of trading after the reporting, shares of
Switch Class A common stock closed at $29.68 per share.
On March 30, 2022, DigitalBridge requested through the special committee’s financial advisors that DigitalBridge and IFM be permitted to submit a joint-
bid at the next deadline. The special committee’s financial advisors informed DigitalBridge and IFM that Switch approved the submission of this joint-bid
on April 1, 2022 to allow the parties to put forth their most competitive bid.
On April 4 and April 5, 2022, the special committee held meetings, attended by representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham,
management and Deloitte, during which management and Deloitte discussed Switch’s recorded liability under the TRA as of December 31, 2021 of $395.6
million and the assumptions used by Switch in determining the liability. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley presented to the special committee an
analysis of the TRA tax benefit payments and early termination payments in various scenarios (in each case as provided to Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley by Switch management), including upon a change in control, and under both Switch’s existing Up-C corporate structure and after a REIT
conversion, noting net present value of the TRA tax benefit payments after a REIT conversion was potentially lower and discussed further how this
should impact a special committee proposal to TRA members on terminating the TRA. In addition, the special committee authorized Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley to send a second round process letter to bidders, reviewed and provided input on the terms of an initial draft merger agreement to
Latham and authorized Latham to make the draft merger agreement available to the bidders.
On April 5, 2022, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley provided a second round process letter to DigitalBridge (now bidding with IFM), Bidder A and
Bidder B and Latham uploaded a draft merger agreement to a virtual data room for review by bidders. The process letter directed bidders to provide a final
bid no later than April 28, 2022.

On April 7, 2022, the special committee held a meeting, attended by representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham, management and
Deloitte. Management discussed the communications to date with certain TRA members, in which such TRA members expressed a willingness to amend
the TRA by reducing the payout to members in order to facilitate a Strategic Transaction, provided some consideration was paid to TRA members in
connection with any such transaction. Following discussion and based upon the analysis provided by Deloitte, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on
the amount of the tax benefit payments and early termination payments owed under various scenarios, including a change in control and after a REIT
conversion, the state of discussions with bidders with respect to a Strategic Transaction, the significant early termination payment that would be due to
TRA holders upon a change in control if no action was taken with respect to the TRA that would likely make a Strategic Transaction no longer attractive
to Switch stockholders, and the significant number of TRA members required to satisfy the 70% Supermajority Threshold necessary to amend the TRA
pursuant to its terms, the special committee proposed to recommend to the board an aggregate payment of approximately $75 million paid to all parties to
the TRA, pro rata, in exchange for terminating the TRA upon the earlier of a change in control and December 31, 2022.
From April 7, 2022 through April 12, 2022, management, the special committee and the board met to discuss next steps with regard to the TRA. Upon the
recommendation of the special committee, the board authorized Switch to enter into an amendment to the TRA that would provide for an aggregate
payout to TRA members of approximately $75 million in exchange for the termination of all obligations under the TRA (the “TRA Amendment”). See “The
Mergers—Amendment to the Tax Receivable Agreement” for a full summary of the TRA Amendment. The special committee believed that amendment
would offer the best opportunity to maximize stockholder value for the Strategic Transaction or conversion to a REIT. Management was also authorized to
begin soliciting approval from TRA members necessary to effect the TRA Amendment.
On April 15, Latham received revised merger agreement drafts from each of DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A. Bidder A also provided initial drafts of an
equity commitment letter and a limited guarantee.
On April 20, 2022, the special committee met to discuss various transaction-related matters. Representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,
Latham and management were in attendance. Management summarized for the special committee negotiations to effect a lease amendment for certain of
Switch’s leased properties in the Las Vegas, Nevada area (the “Leased Properties”) that the bidders had requested as critical to obtaining their financing,
and discussed with the special committee that because of Mr. Tom Thomas’ ownership interests in the Leased Properties, as described more fully in the
section entitled “- Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers,” that he would not take part in discussions with respect to
the Leased Properties. Management then provided an update to the special committee regarding the ongoing process to solicit approvals from TRA
members to satisfy the Supermajority Threshold to amend the TRA. Next, Latham provided the special committee a summary of the two merger agreement
markups received and outlined the material issues therein. With respect to the DigitalBridge/IFM merger agreement, the special committee discussed,
among other things, that (i) Mr. Roy and Mr. Morton were being asked to rollover a portion of their equity in connection with the transaction, (ii)
DigitalBridge/IFM deleted several obligations to obtain antitrust approval between signing and closing, (iii) a number of additional regulatory approvals
were added as conditions to closing, (iv) DigitalBridge/IFM had proposed a buyer termination fee of 5% and a Switch termination fee of 3.75%, (v) the
transaction documents contemplated a mortgage debt commitment that contained additional closing conditionality as compared to a leveraged buyout
financing and (vi) certain representations, warranties and covenants were revised to more buyer-friendly positions. With respect to the Bidder A merger
agreement, the special committee discussed, among other things, that (i) the financing package proposed involved leverage buyout financing rather than
a mortgage debt commitment, (ii) Bidder A was requesting a similar management rollover equity condition as DigitalBridge/IFM, (iii) Bidder A had also
limited its obligations with respect to obtaining antitrust approval, (iv) a similar list of new regulatory approvals were proposed as conditions to closing,
(v) Bidder A had proposed a Bidder A break fee of 6% and a Switch break fee of 3%, as well as an obligation for Switch to reimburse Bidder A for
expenses up to $30 million in the event of a failure to obtain stockholder approval and (vi) certain representations, warranties and covenants were revised
to more buyer-

Table of Contents
friendly positions. Both DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A markups included obtaining voting agreements in support of the Mergers from all of the board
and executive management team and certain stockholders. Following discussion of the draft merger agreements, the special committee directed Latham to
negotiate the merger agreement drafts with legal counsel to DigitalBridge/IFM, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (“STB”), and with legal counsel for
Bidder A. The special committee also considered whether Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley should contact any additional parties as to their interest in
a Strategic Transaction with Switch, but noted that Switch’s consideration of strategic alternatives had appeared in media reports and no other parties
had contacted Switch, Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley with interest in a Strategic Transaction.
On April 20, 2022, representatives for the owners of the Leased Properties informed management that they were not willing to amend the leases for the
Leased Properties; however, they would consider the sale of the Leased Properties to Switch (the “Land Purchase”). Management, after consultation with
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, notified the special committee that it believed such a purchase by Switch would facilitate financing that would allow
a higher price in a Strategic Transaction, and the special committee authorized negotiation of terms under which a purchase might be possible, including a
closing contingent upon a Strategic Transaction closing, and instructed management to bring back terms for final approval.
On April 21, 2022, Latham held separate calls with STB and the legal representatives of Bidder A to discuss their revised drafts of the merger agreement.
Latham highlighted the material issues in the drafts, as well as certain other issues raised in other draft ancillary agreements submitted, and informed legal
counsel for each bidder that they should consider improving those positions in revised drafts to be submitted with their client’s final bid.
During the week of April 18, 2022, Bidder A informed Switch they would need to complete additional diligence in order to have their financing package
finalized in advance of submitting a bid. After discussions and in light of the status of ongoing negotiations in connection with the Land Purchase, the
special committee elected to push the date for final bids from April 28, 2022 to May 5, 2022 in order to allow bidders additional time to finalize their bids,
including their financing packages.
From April 21, 2022 through May 5, 2022, management and Latham held numerous diligence calls with DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A and their
respective representatives relating to a number of matters, including diligence related to financing real estate, benefits, intellectual property, tax and
various regulatory matters.
On April 22, 2022, management informed the special committee that TRA members satisfying the Supermajority Threshold had approved the TRA
Amendment.
On April 28, 2022, Latham provided initial drafts of the Voting and Support Agreement and the Switch Disclosure Letter to STB and legal counsel for
Bidder A.
On May 3, 2022, the media reported that Switch was in negotiations to be purchased by Brookfield Asset Management. On May 5, 2022, the first full day
of trading after the report, shares of Switch Class A common stock closed at $31.64 per share.
On May 4, 2022, representatives of Bidder B informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Bidder B would not submit a revised bid to acquire Switch.
On May 5, 2022, DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A provided revised bids to Switch, along with revised drafts of the Merger Agreement, financing
documents and ancillary agreements. The revised bid from DigitalBridge/IFM proposed to acquire Switch for $34.25 per share, and DigitalBridge/IFM
offered to connect executives of their financing partners with the special committee’s financial advisors to demonstrate DigitalBridge/IFM’s commitment
to the financing. The revised bid from Bidder A proposed to acquire Switch for $29.00 per share, and Bidder A communicated that this reflected a change
in market conditions that impacted financing costs, the impact of the TRA Amendment and the Land Purchase.

On May 6, 2022, the special committee met to discuss the terms of the final bids and revised transaction documents. Representatives from Goldman
Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management were in attendance. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley summarized the terms of the bids and Latham
highlighted certain key issues remaining in the transaction documents. With respect to DigitalBridge/IFM, the special committee considered, among other
things, that the transaction documents continued to contemplate a mortgage debt commitment that contained additional closing conditionality as
compared to a leveraged buyout financing and a DigitalBridge/IFM termination fee of 5% and a Switch termination fee of 3.75%. With respect to Bidder
A, the special committee considered, among other things, that the transaction documents continued to contemplate a leveraged buyout financing, certain
limitations on Bidder A’s obligations to obtain regulatory approval and an obligation for Switch to reimburse Bidder A for expenses up to $30 million in
the event of a failure to obtain stockholder approval. The special committee provided their views and instructed Latham to go back and negotiate with
DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A for key terms, including informing DigitalBridge/IFM that their mortgage debt commitment disadvantaged their bid and
that they should obtain a leveraged buyout financing to give their bid additional closing certainty. During the May 6, 2022 special committee meeting, the
special committee also discussed the status of negotiations for the Land Purchase. Management informed the special committee that negotiations
remained ongoing, particularly with respect to the total price for the Land Purchase.
On May 7, 2022, the special committee met, along with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management, to discuss a
number of transaction-related issues, including communication to each of DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A regarding increasing their offer price and
accepting certain revisions to the terms of the transaction documents, including, with respect to DigitalBridge/IFM, revising their financing to provide
improved deal closing certainty, the status of negotiations regarding the Land Purchase and requests in the bid letter from each bidder that Messrs. Roy
and Morton exchange an aggregate of approximately $500 million of equity in connection with the transaction. Mr. Morton informed the special committee
that he and Mr. Roy were amenable to rolling over the requested amount of equity were Switch to enter into a definitive agreement with the winning
bidder, and had engaged their own counsel that was prepared to negotiate the terms of any rollover and that they would not negotiate with either bidder
on the terms of any rollover until the special committee authorized them to do so. Furthermore, Mr. Roy and Mr. Morton both agreed that neither would
discuss their respective employment status or compensation matters with the bidders until authorized to do so by the special committee.
Later on May 7, 2022, Latham sent revised drafts of all transaction documents back to STB and Bidder A’s legal representative. From May 7, 2022 until
May 11, 2022, Latham, STB and the legal representatives of Bidder A, as applicable, traded revised drafts of the various transaction documents and
negotiated the key open points remaining in the documents.
During the evening on May 7, 2022, in response to the proposal for Messrs. Roy and Morton to rollover their Switch equity, Latham forwarded to STB
and legal counsel for Bidder A a draft rollover term sheet prepared by counsel for Messrs. Roy and Morton. Latham communicated to STB and legal
counsel for Bidder A that the winning bidder would be connected with counsel to Messrs. Roy and Morton to negotiate the terms thereof in advance of
signing.
On May 8, 2022, the special committee, along with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management, met to continue to
discuss the bids received from DigitalBridge/IFM and Bidder A. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley informed the special committee that Bidder A had
agreed to increase its offer price to $30.00 per share from $29.00 per share. Following the discussion, the special committee authorized Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley to communicate to each bidder to improve its bid price in order to finalize a transaction and, additionally with respect to
DigitalBridge/IFM, to seek to improve the certainty of its financing package. With respect to the Land Purchase, both bidders had been informed of the
negotiations and reiterated to Switch that the Land Purchase would need to be finalized in advance of executing definitive agreements for the proposed
Strategic Transaction.
On May 9, 2022, the special committee held two meetings and the full board met once to discuss various transaction-related matters. Each of these
meetings were also attended by representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management. During the morning meetings, Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley
45
Table of Contents
informed the special committee (i) that Bidder A had agreed to increase its offer price to $32.50 per share from $30.00 and conditioned this price on signing
the transaction by end of day and (ii) that DigitalBridge/IFM had agreed to make certain improvements to the terms of its financing package and the draft
merger agreement to improve closing certainty, including by limiting certain conditions to funding and limiting the possibility of a material breach claim by
DigitalBridge/IFM in connection with Switch’s obligations to provide financing cooperation between signing and closing. Following these meetings and
significant discussion on the topics among the special committee, the board, management, Latham, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the special
committee concluded it was in the best interest of maximizing stockholder value to authorize Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to inform each bidder
that (i) Switch intended to consummate a transaction with one of the bidders prior to market open on May 11, 2022, (ii) that each bidder should provide a
“best and final” offer by the following morning, which should include an increase in offer price and (iii) that DigitalBridge/IFM should continue to make
improvements to its financing package to provide for greater closing certainty.
Also on May 9, 2022, the media reported that Switch was in advanced discussions with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and DigitalBridge for the sale
of Switch. On May 6, 2022, the last day of trading prior to the report, shares of Switch Class A common stock closed at $30.49 per share. On May 10, 2022,
the first full day of trading after the report, shares of Switch Class A common stock closed at $30.75 per share.
Both the special committee and the board met separately on multiple occasions over the course of the day on May 10, 2022. In attendance during these
meetings were representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Latham and management. During these meetings, representatives of Morgan
Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Latham, as applicable, reported to the special committee and the board that (i) Bidder A had informed Morgan Stanley that it
was unwilling to increase its offer price beyond $32.50 and that they would not negotiate further for the purchase of Switch at a higher price and (ii)
DigitalBridge/IFM had offered an increased break fee of $693 million, or approximately 8% of the equity value that would be payable upon certain
breaches of the merger agreement. Management also informed the special committee that Switch was close to reaching terms in connection with the Land
Purchase for a total purchase price of $300 million. The closing price per share of Switch Class A common stock on May 10, 2022 was $30.75.
Later in the day on May 10, 2022, the board met to discuss the revised terms proposed by DigitalBridge/IFM. Following significant discussion among the
board, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham, taking into account the outreach, negotiations, transaction terms and offer prices, the board voiced
its support for pursuing a transaction with DigitalBridge. Following the board meeting, the special committee convened a meeting and following extensive
discussions, the special committee determined that the DigitalBridge/IFM proposal provided the best value to Switch stockholders, and authorized
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to convey to DigitalBridge and IFM that Switch was interested in executing definitive documentation for a
transaction prior to market opening on the following day and that DigitalBridge/IFM should increase its offer by an additional $0.25 per share in order to
secure the transaction. When making this determination, the special committee took into account that DigitalBridge/IFM had made a number of
concessions with respect to its mortgage debt financing over a short period of time, including improving closing certainty by limiting certain conditions
to funding and limiting the possibility of a material breach claim by DigitalBridge/IFM in connection with Switch’s obligations to cooperate with regards
to the financing between signing and closing. The board of directors of Switch also determined, after consultation with Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, that the proposal by DigitalBridge/IFM had an acceptable level of risk around the financing and closing certainty.
During the early evening on May 10, 2022, DigitalBridge/IFM communicated that $34.25 was their best and final offer price. DigitalBridge/IFM noted that
this was an increase from their initial offer of $34.00 per share, which offer did not contemplate the additional approximately $75 million payment in
connection with the TRA Amendment or the $300 million payment in connection with the Land Purchase. Because DigitalBridge/IFM had communicated
that any Strategic Transaction was conditioned on Messrs. Roy and Morton rolling over their Switch equity, the special committee authorized Messrs.
Roy and Morton to have discussions and negotiations with DigitalBridge/IFM regarding the terms of their equity rollover. During the course of the
evening, counsel
46
Table of Contents
for Messrs. Roy and Morton was connected with STB, exchanged drafts of the rollover term sheet with DigitalBridge/IFM and STB and negotiated terms
of the rollover with DigitalBridge/IFM and STB.
During the late evening on May 10, 2022, the board convened along with management, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham. Goldman Sachs
reviewed with the board Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses of the merger consideration, and rendered to the special committee an oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated May 11, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various
qualifications, assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received by holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the
outstanding shares of Switch Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a
detailed discussion of Goldman Sachs’s opinion, please see “- Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 54 of this
proxy statement. Latham then reviewed the proposed final terms of the Merger Agreement and the related ancillary agreements and presented to the
board regarding their fiduciary obligations under Nevada law in connection with the proposed transaction. Management for Switch also informed the
board and the special committee that, based upon, among other things, their views of Switch’s prospects on a standalone basis, its consideration of all
the alternatives available to Switch and the information and advice provided by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham, it was Switch executive
management’s recommendation that the board approve the transaction as proposed by DigitalBridge/IFM upon the terms negotiated by the parties and
set forth in the definitive documents. Next, the special committee informed the board that, based upon, among other things, its consideration of all the
alternatives available to Switch and the information and advice provided by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Latham over the course of evaluating
Strategic Transactions, it was the special committee’s recommendation that the board approve the transaction as proposed by DigitalBridge/IFM upon
the terms negotiated by the parties and set forth in the definitive documents. The board then discussed the various reasons to approve the Mergers, and
certain countervailing factors. For a detailed description of the various reasons considered by the board, see “- Recommendation of the Board of
Directors and the Special Committee” beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement. After further discussion, including a review of the status of
Switch’s business, the process that led to the proposed Mergers, the alternatives available to Switch, including remaining as a public company, and the
risks and benefits associated with the proposed transaction, the board unanimously (other than Mr. Roy who informed the special committee and the
board that he was supportive of the transaction and would vote for the transaction in the interest of all stockholders, but under advice of counsel,
recused himself from the vote given his agreement to participate in a rollover of a portion of his equity) (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the LLC Merger and the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of Switch, Switch, Ltd., and
Sunshine Merger Sub, Ltd., respectively, and their respective stockholders or equityholders, as applicable, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii) directed that the Mergers be submitted for consideration at a special meeting of Switch’s stockholders and (iii)
recommended that Switch’s stockholders approve the Merger. The Land Purchase was also approved as part of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.
Prior to the market opening on May 11, 2022, Latham and STB finalized all transaction documents and Switch, Switch, Ltd., Sunshine Merger Sub, Ltd.,
Sunshine Bidco Inc. and Sunshine Parent Merger Sub Inc. executed the Merger Agreement and the ancillary agreements to be executed in connection
therewith.
Before NYSE opened on May 11, 2022, DigitalBridge/IFM and Switch issued a press release announcing the entry into the Merger Agreement.

As described above in the section entitled “-Background of the Mergers”, prior to and in reaching its determination to (i) authorize and approve the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the LLC Merger and the Merger, (ii) direct that the Merger be submitted for
consideration at a special meeting of Switch’s stockholders and (iii) recommend that Switch’s stockholders approve the Merger, the special
47Table of Contents
committee and the board consulted with and received the advice of their outside legal counsel and the special committee’s financial advisors, discussed
certain issues with management and considered a variety of factors weighing positively in favor of the Mergers, the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the following material factors:
a)
the $34.25 per share or unit price for Switch Class A common stock and Company Ltd. Common Units to be paid in cash, which was in
excess of the all-time highest closing price for shares of Switch Class A common stock on any day since the date of Switch’s initial public
offering in October 2017, and which represented a premium of approximately 19% over the undisturbed closing stock price of Switch Class A
common stock on March 18, 2022, the last full trading day prior to media reporting regarding a potential sale of Switch;
b)
the special committee and the board’s understanding of Switch’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings, prospects, competitive
position and the nature of the industry in which Switch competes;
c)
the special committee and the board’s understanding of the risks and uncertainties in the industry in which Switch competes, and the risks
that Switch would face if it continued to operate on a standalone public company basis, including:
i)
risks relating to the fundamentals for companies in the data center industry, including, but not limited to, increased competition,
falling market rents and decreases in or slowed growth of global data, e-commerce and demand for outsourcing of data storage and
cloud-based applications;
ii)
risks relating to the operation of Switch, including, but not limited to, economic downturn, natural disaster or oversupply of data
centers in the geographic areas that Switch serves, significant competition in the data center industry, a loss of key customers, a loss
of access to key third-party service providers and suppliers, a loss of power or cooling which may interrupt Switch’s services to its
customers, increased operating costs and capital expenditures at Switch’s facilities, including those resulting from higher utilization
by customers, unknown or contingent liabilities related to Switch’s historical acquisitions of property or other assets and the inability
to identify or complete acquisitions of additional properties or other assets;
iii)
risks relating to financing of Switch, particularly in light of its capital expenditure requirements, including, but not limited to, the failure
to obtain necessary outside financing on favorable terms, or at all, restrictions in the instruments governing Switch’s indebtedness,
increases in market interest rates, volatility in the market price and volume of Switch Class A common stock and potential negative
impacts resulting from incurring excessive leverage;
iv)
risks relating to Switch’s development of properties, obtaining applicable permits, power and connectivity and Switch’s ability to
successfully lease or purchase those properties;
v)
risks relating to compliance with existing and future applicable laws and regulations;
vi)
risks relating to Switch’s qualification as a REIT for fiscal year 2023 (including distributional requirements and compliance with
technical requirements of the Code); and
vii)
other risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors set forth in Switch’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2021, on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022 and current reports on Form 8-K;
d)
turnover of Switch’s executives and other key personnel;
e)
the special committee and the board’s determination that other alternatives to a sale of all of Switch, including entering into financing
transactions, divesting certain assets and pursuing joint ventures or acquisitions, which alternatives the special committee evaluated with
the assistance of its advisors, did not represent an attractive alternative to a sale of the entirety of Switch in light of, among other factors,
the potential risks, rewards and uncertainties associated with those alternatives;
48
Table of Contents
f)
the fact that the consideration to be paid in the Mergers is all cash, which provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to holders of
Switch Class A common stock and Company Ltd. Common Units, especially when viewed against any internal or external risks and
uncertainties associated with Switch’s standalone strategy, immediately upon the closing of the Mergers;
g)
the ability of the board to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends to Switch’s stockholders for the entire period
between signing and closing of the Mergers at a quarterly rate of up to $0.07 per share of Switch Class A common stock in accordance with
the Merger Agreement without a reduction in the Merger Consideration to be paid to Switch’s stockholders, as more fully described below
in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement – Certain Dividends”;
h)
the possibility that an infrastructure fund or other private financial sponsor might be able to realize more value from the business than a
public company buyer and thereby pay a higher price to acquire Switch, including the ability to fund developments without having to rely
on the volatility of equity capital markets;
i)
Switch management’s presentation to the special committee and the board of its views and analyses, in each case, conducted with the
assistance of the special committee’s financial advisors;
j)
the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the special committee and the board by Goldman Sachs as well as the oral opinion of
Goldman Sachs rendered to the board, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated May 11, 2022, and that is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various qualifications, assumptions
and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Switch
Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, which is more fully
described in the section entitled “- Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor”;
k)
the special committee and the board’s assessment, taking into account the foregoing factors, of Switch’s value on a standalone basis
relative to the $34.25 per share or unit of Switch Class A common stock and Company Ltd. Common Units in connection with the Mergers,
and the possibility that the trading price of shares of Switch Class A common stock would not reach and sustain such price, or that doing
so could take a considerable period of time;
l)
the special committee and the board’s process for soliciting and responding to offers from the third parties that were believed to be the most
willing and able to pay the highest price for Switch, which included providing such parties with an opportunity to conduct due diligence
and conduct management sessions with members of Switch’s management, as described in the section entitled “–Background of the
Mergers”;
m)
the special committee and the board’s belief that, based on discussions with DigitalBridge and IFM and other potential counterparties,
$34.25 represented the best and final offer and the highest price per share or unit of Switch Class A common stock or Company Ltd.
Common Units that DigitalBridge, IFM or any other potential counterparty would be willing to pay, and any request for a further price
increase or solicitation of additional bids from other third parties would have created a meaningful risk that DigitalBridge/IFM might
determine not to enter into the transaction and to terminate negotiations, in which event stockholders of Switch would lose the opportunity
to obtain the proposed $34.25 per share or unit of Switch Class A common stock or Company Ltd. Common Units in cash being offered;
n)
the successful track record that DigitalBridge and IFM have developed in acquiring other companies and the consolidated financial
strength and industry expertise of DigitalBridge and IFM;
o)
the fact that DigitalBridge and IFM have provided certain guarantees and equity commitments in favor of Switch as described below in the
section entitled “- Financing”;
p)
the provisions of the Merger Agreement that permit Switch, in response to certain unsolicited takeover proposals, to furnish information to,
and conduct negotiations with, third parties under certain
49
Table of Contents
circumstances and, under certain conditions, to accept a superior proposal, and Switch’s corresponding right to terminate the Merger
Agreement (subject to payment of the company termination fee of $260 million) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
the consummation of such Superior Proposal;
q)
the ability of Switch to seek specific performance in certain circumstances, if required, in order to enforce the terms of the Merger
Agreement;
r)
the provisions of the Merger Agreement that permit the special committee and the board to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify its
recommendation that our stockholders vote to approve the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
under certain circumstances;
s)
the high probability that the Mergers would be consummated based on, among other things, DigitalBridge and IFM’s independent
respective abilities to complete large acquisition transactions and the $693 million parent termination fee, payable to Switch if the Merger
Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, which payment is guaranteed by certain affiliates of DigitalBridge and IFM;
t)
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the related transaction documents, which were reviewed by the special committee
and the board with Latham, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and the fact that such terms were the product of arm’s-length negotiations
between the parties;
u)
the fact that resolutions approving the Mergers were evaluated, negotiated and recommended and approved by the special committee prior
to presentation to the board for approval, a committee which is comprised solely of independent directors with respect to the Mergers and
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, who are not affiliated with DigitalBridge/IFM, are not employees of Switch or any
of its subsidiaries;
v)
the fact that the Mergers would be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and our stockholders would be free to reject the Mergers by
voting against the Mergers; and
w)
the willingness of Rob Roy and Thomas Morton to roll over equity with the new owners of Switch on the similar terms as the bidder’s other
equity investment sources.
In the course of its deliberations, the special committee and the board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the
Merger Agreement and the Mergers, including the following material factors:
a)
the potential upside in Switch’s standalone strategic plan;
b)
the possibility that the Mergers might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all due to a failure of certain conditions, including with
respect to the required approval of the transaction by the necessary regulatory authorities;
c)
the risks and costs to Switch if the Mergers do not close in a timely manner or at all, including the potential negative impact on Switch’s
ability to retain key employees, the diversion of management and employee attention and the potential disruptive effect on Switch’s day-to-
day operations and Switch’s relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties;
d)
the fact that holders of Switch Class A common stock and Company Ltd. Common Units, other than as described below in the sections
entitled “- Rollover Agreements” and “-Potential Employment Arrangements with Parent”, will have no ongoing equity interest in the
surviving corporation following the Mergers, meaning that the holders of Switch Class A common stock and Company Ltd. Common Units,
other than Messrs. Roy and Morton, will not (by virtue of their holdings) participate in Switch’s potential future earnings or growth;
e)
the restrictions on the conduct of Switch’s business prior to the consummation of the Mergers, which may delay or prevent Switch from
undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action that it might otherwise take with respect to the operations and
strategy of Switch;
50
Table of Contents
f)
the risk that the parties may incur significant costs and material delays resulting from seeking regulatory approvals and other clearances,
consents and approvals necessary for consummation of the Mergers;
g)
the provisions of the Merger Agreement that restrict Switch’s ability to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding
alternative business combination transactions, subject to specified exceptions, and that require Switch to negotiate with Parent (if it so
desires) prior to Switch being able to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal;
h)
the possibility that Switch’s obligation to pay the company termination fee of $260 million upon the termination of the Merger Agreement
under certain circumstances could discourage other potential acquirors from making a superior proposal to acquire Switch;
i)
the significant costs involved in connection with negotiating the Merger Agreement; consummating the Mergers; and the fact that if the
Mergers are not consummated, Switch may be required to bear such costs;
j)
the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated therein; and
k)
the fact that an all-cash transaction would be taxable to the holders of Switch Class A common stock and Company Ltd. Common Units that
are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In addition, the special committee and the board were aware of and considered the fact that certain of Switch’s executive officers and directors have
financial interests in the Mergers that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Switch stockholders generally, including those interests that are a
result of (i) employment and compensation arrangements with Switch, (ii) payouts under the terms of the TRA Amendment, (iii) the rollover and/or (iv)
ownership interests in the Land Purchase, in each case, as described more fully below in the section entitled “- Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Mergers”.
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the special committee and the board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the
material factors considered by the special committee and the board. The special committee and the board reached the conclusion to (i) authorize and
approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the LLC Merger and the Merger, (ii) declare the Merger advisable
and in the best interests of Switch, Switch, Ltd. and Sunshine Merger Sub, Ltd., respectively, and their respective shareholders or equityholders, as
applicable, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and (iii) recommend that Switch’s stockholders approve the
Merger, in light of the factors described above and other factors that the special committee and the board believed were appropriate. In view of the wide
variety of factors considered by the special committee and the board in connection with its evaluation of the Mergers and the complexity of these
matters, the special committee and the board did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any
aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the special committee and the board. Rather, the special
committee and the board made its recommendations based on the totality of the information available to the special committee and the board, including
discussions with, and questioning of, Switch’s management and its financial and legal advisors. In considering the factors discussed above, individual
members of the special committee and the board may have given different weights to different factors.
This explanation of the special committee and the board’s reasons for its recommendations and other information presented in this section is forward-
looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 26.

"Switch, Inc._20220627_DEFM14A_20186829_4481092.Pdf",Certain Unaudited Financial Projections,"Certain Unaudited Financial Projections
While Switch from time to time provides a financial outlook to investors with respect to the then-current fiscal year, Switch has not, as a matter of course,
otherwise publicly disclosed longer-term internal projections as to future performance, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the
uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the Mergers, prior to the
execution of the Merger Agreement, Switch management prepared and provided to the board in connection with its evaluation of the Mergers and the
special committee’s financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, for its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion, certain nonpublic,
internal, financial projections regarding Switch’s future operations for fiscal years 2022 through 2031 (the “Switch Projections”). The Switch Projections
were also provided to DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A, Bidder B and each of their respective advisors and representatives. Switch has included below a
summary of the Switch Projections for the purpose of providing stockholders access to certain nonpublic information that was prepared for the board,
Goldman Sachs, DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A, Bidder B and each of their respective advisors and representatives for purposes of evaluating the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence
your decision, if you are a Switch stockholder, to vote in favor of the Mergers. The inclusion of this summary should not be regarded as an indication
that Switch management or anyone who received the Switch Projections then considered, or now considers, them to be a reliable prediction of future
events, and the Switch Projections should not be relied upon as such. This information is not fact and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on the Switch Projections.
The Switch Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance with published
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentations of financial projections, but in the
view of management, were prepared on a reasonable basis and reflect the assumptions and estimates available at the time they were prepared. The
prospective financial information requires significant estimates and assumptions that make it inherently less comparable to the similarly titled GAAP
measures in Switch’s historical GAAP financial statements. The Switch Projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Switch
management and were not prepared with the assistance of, or reviewed, compiled or examined by, independent accountants.
While presented with numeric specificity, the Switch Projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions (including those related to industry
performance and general business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Switch’s businesses) that are inherently
subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of Switch’s management. Important factors that may affect actual results
52Table of Contents
and cause the Switch Projections to not be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Switch’s businesses (including its
ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business, economic, competitive,
regulatory and financial market conditions and other factors described under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and other risk
factors described in Switch’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March
31, 2022 and current reports on Form 8-K. The Switch Projections also reflect numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time they
were prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the
Switch Projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Switch stockholders are urged to
review the most recent SEC filings of Switch for a description of the reported and anticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital
resources during 2021, including in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Switch’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022 and current reports on Form 8-
K.
The inclusion of a summary of the Switch Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of Switch or its officers,
directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives considered the Switch Projections to necessarily be predictive of actual future events, and the
Switch Projections should not be relied upon as such nor should the information contained in the Switch Projections be considered appropriate for other
purposes. None of Switch or its officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not
differ materially from the Switch Projections. The Switch Projections were prepared by Switch prior to entry into and public announcement of the
Mergers, have not been updated as of the date of this proxy statement and Switch undertakes no obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the
Switch Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Switch Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events,
even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Switch Projections are shown to be in error. The Switch Projections cover multiple
years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.
Switch has not made and makes no representation to any person in the Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning the Switch Projections or regarding
Switch’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Switch Projections or that the projected results will be achieved. Switch urges
all stockholders to review Switch’s most recent SEC filings for a description of Switch’s reported financial results.
The Switch Projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions, including the variables discussed above, as well as the following material
assumptions: (i) Switch conversion to a REIT in 2023, (ii) 55% adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO"") dividend payout policy from 2023 onwards, (iii)
$0 in taxes as part of the REIT conversion, (iii) maximum debt / EBITDA ratio of 6.0x, (iv) equity offerings of $200 million in Q3 2023 and $220 million in Q3
2024 to fund existing growth and capital expenditures and (v) termination of any TRA liability for a total payment in 2022 of $75 million. The Switch
Projections were also provided without the assumption of Switch converting to a REIT and with other REIT conversion sensitivity analyses around
accelerated depreciation and tax structure. The Switch Projections do not give effect to the Mergers. The Switch Projections were provided to
DigitalBridge, IFM, Bidder A, Bidder B and each of their respective advisors and representatives and a summary is presented in the following table, with
all figures rounded to the nearest million. Switch management directed Goldman Sachs to use and rely upon the Switch Projections for purposes of its
opinion and related financial analyses and the Switch Projections were approved for Goldman Sachs’s use by the board. For more information, see “ -
Reasons for the Mergers” and “ - Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor.”

Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor",60,62
"Switch, Inc._20220627_DEFM14A_20186829_4481092.Pdf",Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor,"Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor
Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the special committee of the board of directors of Switch that, as of May 11, 2022 and based upon and subject to
the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $34.25 in cash per share of Switch’s Class A common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent
and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Switch’s Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view
to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated May 11, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its
opinion for the information and assistance of the special committee in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is
not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Switch’s Class A common stock or any other securities of Switch should vote with respect to
the Merger, or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the Merger Agreement;
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Switch for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2021;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Switch;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Switch;
54Table of Contents
•
certain other communications from Switch to its stockholders; and
•
the Switch Projections, as prepared by management of Switch and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the special committee of the board
of directors of Switch.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Switch regarding their assessment of the past and current business
operations, financial condition, and future prospects of Switch; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for Switch’s Class A common stock;
compared certain financial and stock market information for Switch with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly
traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the data center industry and in other industries; and performed such other
studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the special committee, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without
assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of the special committee, that
the Switch Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the special committee.
Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-
balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Switch or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs
assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any
adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the Merger will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in
any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Switch to engage in the transaction or the relative merits of the
transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Switch; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $34.25 in cash per share of
Switch’s Class A common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Switch’s Class A common
stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the
Merger Agreement or the transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into
or amended in connection with the Merger, including the TRA and any amendments (including the TRA Amendment) and related payments thereunder,
and the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities (including the
shares of Switch’s Class B common stock, the shares of Switch’s Class C common stock (none of which are outstanding) and the Company Ltd. Common
Units), creditors, or other constituencies of Switch; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of Switch, or class of such persons in connection with the Mergers, whether relative to the $34.25 in cash per share of
Switch’s Class A common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Switch’s Class A common
stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and other
conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for
updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman
Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Switch’s Class A common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential
effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Switch, Parent or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability
of the Switch, Company Ltd. or Parent, or the ability of the Switch, Company Ltd. or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock
pursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to:
•
$26.62, the volume weighted average price (the “VWAP”) per share of Switch’s Class A common stock over the 1-month-trading period
ended March 18, 2022, the last trading day before media reports that Switch was exploring a sale of the company (the “1-Month
Undisturbed VWAP”);
•
$26.36, the VWAP of per share of Switch’s Class A common stock over the 3-month-trading period ended March 18, 2022 (the “3-Month
Undisturbed VWAP”);
•
$26.10, the VWAP per share of Switch’s Class A common stock over the 6-month-trading period ended March 18, 2022 (the “6-Month
Undisturbed VWAP”);
•
$28.78, the highest closing price per share of Switch’s Class A common stock for the 52-week period ended March 18, 2022 (the “52-Week
High (Undisturbed) Price”); and
•
$31.64, the highest current closing price per share of Switch’s Class A common stock for the 52-week period ended May 10, 2022 (the “52-
Week High (Current) Price”).

Selected Companies Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial information for Switch and for the following publicly traded
corporations in the data center industry (collectively, the “Selected Companies”):
•
CyrusOne
•
Equinix Inc.
•
Digital Realty
Although none of the Selected Companies is directly comparable to Switch, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Switch.
56
Table of Contents
Goldman Sachs calculated for each of the Selected Companies:
•
enterprise value as of May 10, 2022 (or, in the case of CyrusOne, March 29, 2022, which was the last day of public trading of CyrusOne
common stock) as a multiple of the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (“IBES”) estimates of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization (“EBITDA”) (the “EV/ EBITDA Multiple”) for 2022 and 2023; and
•
the closing share price on May 10, 2022 (or, in the case of CyrusOne, March 29, 2022, which was the last day of public trading of CyrusOne
common stock) as a multiple of the IBES estimates of adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) (the “P/ AFFO Multiple”) for 2022 and 2023.
In addition, Goldman Sachs calculated for Switch:
•
the EV/EBITDA Multiple using the enterprise values as of May 10, 2022 and March 18, 2022, respectively, and IBES estimates and the
Switch Projections, respectively, for 2022 and 2023; and
•
the P/AFFO Multiple using the closing price on May 10, 2022 and March 18, 2022, respectively, and IBES estimates and the Switch
Projections, respectively, for 2022 and 2023.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative
future value per share of the Switch’s Class A common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value
of a company’s equity as a function of such company’s financial multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Switch Projections for each of the
fiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs first calculated (a) implied enterprise values for Switch, as of December 31 for each of fiscal years 2022 to 2024,
by applying EV / next twelve month “NTM” EBITDA multiples ranging from 22.0x to 26.0x to EBITDA estimates for each of fiscal years 2023 to 2025 and
(b) implied future share prices for Switch’s Class A common stock as of December 31 for each of fiscal years 2022 to 2024, by applying P/NTM AFFO
multiples ranging from 21.0x to 25.0x to AFFO estimates for each of fiscal years 2023 to 2025. These illustrative EV/NTM EBITDA and P/AFFO multiples
were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical enterprise value to EBITDA
and AFFO multiples for Switch and the Selected Companies. Goldman Sachs then, in the case of the analysis using EV/NTM EBITDA multiples,
subtracted the amount of Switch’s forecasted net debt as of December 31, 2022 to 2024, using the Switch Projections, from the implied enterprise values to
derive a range of illustrative implied equity values for Switch as of December 31 for each of the years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs then, in the case of the
analysis using EV/NTM EBITDA multiples, divided these implied equity values by the number of projected year-end fully diluted shares of the Switch’s
common stock for each of the years 2022 to
57
Table of Contents
2024, each as provided by management of Switch and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the special committee, to derive an illustrative range of implied
future share prices for Switch’s Class A common stock. Goldman Sachs then, in the case of both the analysis using EV/NTM EBITDA multiples and the
analysis using P/NTM AFFO multiples, discounted these implied future share prices back to March 31, 2022 using an illustrative discount rate of 8.2%,
reflecting an estimate of Switch’s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which
requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Switch, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.
This analysis using the EV/NTM EBITDA multiples resulted in a range of implied present values of $23.99 to $35.32 per share of Switch’s Class A
common stock. This analysis using the P/NTM AFFO multiples resulted in a range of implied present values of $24.29 to $34.25 per share of Switch’s
Class A common stock.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Switch Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on
Switch. Using discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 8.0%, reflecting estimates of Switch’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to
present value as of March 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Switch for the years 2022 through 2031 as reflected in the Switch
Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Switch, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to
2.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow to be generated by Switch, as reflected in the Switch Projections. Goldman Sachs derived such
discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s target capital
structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for
the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by
Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Switch Projections and market expectations regarding long-
term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Switch by adding the ranges
of present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Switch the net debt of
Switch as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of Switch, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Switch. Goldman Sachs then divided
the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Switch, as provided by management Switch to derive
a range of illustrative present values per share of Switch’s Class A common stock ranging from $24.44 to $37.78.

For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated the enterprise value, represented by the transaction, as a multiple of the target
company’s EBITDA as reported or calculated using publicly available financial information for the applicable trailing twelve-month period (“EV/LTM
EBITDA multiples”), except that for the Macquarie/AirTrunk and Digital Realty-Brookfield/Ascenty transactions, Goldman Sachs used the EV/NTM
EBITDA multiples due to limited publicly available information. While none of the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are
directly comparable to Switch, the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of
analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Switch’s results, market size and product profile.
The following table presents the results of this analysis:
Range
Median
EV/LTM EBITDA
Tier 1: 22.8x-29.6x
Other: 12.0x-33.3x
Tier 1: 26.0x
Other: 24.0x
Based on the results of the foregoing calculations of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples and Goldman Sachs’ professional judgment and experience, Goldman
Sachs’ applied a reference range of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples of 26.0x, representing the median for the Tier 1 Selected Transactions, to 29.6x,
representing the multiple for the American Tower/CoreSite transaction, to Switch’s LTM EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter of 2022, as provided by
management of Switch, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for Switch. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from this range of implied enterprise
values net debt of Switch as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of Switch, and divided the result by the total number of fully diluted shares
outstanding as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of Switch, to derive a range of implied values per share of Switch’s Class A common stock
of $26.54 to $31.09.
Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition transactions
announced during the time period from 2012 through May 10, 2022 involving targets that were publicly traded companies in the technology, media and
telecom industry in the United States and publicly traded REITs in the United States in which the disclosed enterprise values for the transactions were
greater than $1.0 billion. For each full calendar year (and for the period ending May 10, 2022 in the case of 2022) during this period and for the entire
period overall, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the average, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in
the transactions relative to the applicable targets’ last undisturbed 52-week high closing stock prices prior to announcement of the transactions. This
analysis indicated an average premium of 6% for the entire period overall and a range of average premia per annum for each of the years (and for the
period ending May 10, 2022 in the case of 2022) of negative 2% to 18%. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of negative 3% and 75th
percentile premium of 16% for the entire period overall and a range of 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia per annum for each of the years (and for
the period ending May 10, 2022 in the case of 2022) of negative 9% to 5% for the 25th percentile premia per annum and of 7% to 32% for the 75th
percentile premia per annum. Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ professional judgment and experience, Goldman
Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of (3)% to 16%, representing the 25th percentile premium and the 75th percentile premium for the
entire period in the foregoing analysis, to the undisturbed 52-week high closing price per share of Switch’s Class A common stock of $28.78 as of March
18, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Switch’s Class A common stock of $27.92 to $33.38.

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to Switch or the merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the special committee as to the fairness from a financial
point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of Switch’s Class A common stock of the
$34.25 in cash per share of Switch’s Class A common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport
to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of
future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their
respective advisors, none of Switch, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those
forecast.
The merger consideration of $34.25 in cash per shares of Switch’s Class A common stock was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between
Switch and Parent and was approved by the special committee. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the special committee during these negotiations.
Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the special committee or that any specific amount of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Mergers.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the special committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the special committee in
making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs
attached as Annex B.

to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of DigitalBridge and IFM from time to time and may do so in the future.
The special committee selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor, in part, because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that
has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger and because of its familiarity with Switch. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 11,
2022, the special committee engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between the
special committee and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement
of the Merger, at approximately $47,000,000 all of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Switch has agreed to reimburse
Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against
various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.",62,69

taken, all actions and use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to consummate and obtain the
Equity Financing contemplated by the equity commitment letters on or prior to the closing date on the terms and conditions set forth in the equity
commitment letters, including causing the equity investors to maintain in full force and effect the equity commitment letters.
The Company, Company Ltd. and Company Merger Sub are third party beneficiaries of the right granted to Parent to specific performance under the
equity commitment letters and are entitled to enforce Parent’s rights to specific performance of DigitalBridge and IFM GIF to fund all or any portion of
their respective equity commitments under the equity commitment letters, subject to the terms thereof, if the Company is entitled to specific performance
of Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Debt Financing

The following summary describes certain relevant provisions of the TRA and the material provisions of the TRA Amendment. The descriptions of the
TRA and the TRA Amendment in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to
the TRA and the TRA Amendment, each of which is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the TRA and the
TRA Amendment carefully and in their entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the TRA and the TRA Amendment that is
important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the TRA and the TRA Amendment and not by this
summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
Concurrent with the initial public offering of its Class A common stock, the Company entered into the TRA with Company Ltd. and the members of
Company Ltd. party thereto. Exchanges or redemptions of Company Ltd. Common Units for cash or shares of Class A common stock are expected to
produce favorable tax attributes for the Company. When the Company acquires Company Ltd. Common Units from such members through these
exchanges or redemptions, anticipated tax basis adjustments are likely to increase (for tax purposes) the Company’s depreciation and amortization
deductions, thereby reducing the amount of income tax that the Company would be required to pay in the future in the absence of this increased basis.
This increased tax basis may also decrease the gain (or increase the loss) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent that the tax basis is
allocated to those assets. Under the terms of the TRA, absent a change of control of the Company, the Company would generally be required to pay to
members of Company Ltd. party to the TRA 85% of the applicable savings, if any, in income tax that the Company realizes, or that the Company is deemed
to realize, as a result of (1) these tax attributes that are created as a result of the exchanges or redemptions of the such members’ Company Ltd. Common
Units (calculated under certain assumptions), (2) tax benefits related to imputed interest, and (3) payments under the TRA. Amendment of the TRA
requires the approval of members of Company Ltd. satisfying the Supermajority Threshold.
64Table of Contents
In addition, the TRA provides that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination or other changes of control were to occur, then the
TRA would terminate and the Company’s obligations, or the Company’s successor’s obligations, under the TRA would accelerate and become due and
payable. Absent the TRA Amendment, the amount of such accelerated change of control payment obligations would have been calculated as aggregate
payment obligations under the TRA absent a change of control based on certain assumptions set forth in the TRA, including the assumption that the
Company would have sufficient taxable income in each taxable year ending on or after the change of control to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits
that are subject to the TRA and that any un-exchanged Company Ltd. Common Units would be exchanged for cash at the market value of the Class A
common stock as of the closing of the change of control, and applying a discount rate to those payments equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The
Mergers, upon closing, constitute a change of control under the TRA that would cause the payment obligations to accelerate and become due and
payable.
For more information with respect to the TRA, please see our other filings with the SEC. A copy of the TRA is included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s
Form S-1 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on September 8, 2017.
As a result of negotiation by the special committee, on May 11, 2022, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Company
Ltd. and members of Company Ltd. satisfying the Supermajority Threshold entered into, which was concurrently publicly filed, the TRA Amendment, in
accordance with the terms of the TRA. The TRA Amendment establishes that in exchange for the termination of the TRA and all rights associated
therewith, the parties to the TRA (other than the Company) will be entitled to receive a payment in cash from the Company of $0.37 per Company Ltd.
Common Unit (such implied price equating to $5.89 per share of Company Class A common stock if there were no reduction in the amount of aggregate
accelerated change of control payments required to be made under the then-current terms of the TRA) in connection with the closing of the Mergers in
full satisfaction of the payment obligations to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA. Such payments will be made by the Company as promptly as
practicable following the earlier of (i) the closing of the Mergers (or any other change of control of the Company (as defined in the TRA)), or (ii)
December 31, 2022. This represents a reduction of approximately $1,121 million, which is an approximately 93.72% reduction of the estimated aggregate
amount of approximately $1,196 million that would have otherwise been payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA in respect of a change of control
of the Company at the implied price per share of Class A common stock offered by Parent, absent the TRA Amendment.

In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Parent
Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Members have entered into Rollover Agreements, pursuant to which such Rollover
Members committed to contribute approximately $424.3 million worth of Company Ltd. Common Units in the aggregate (approximately 66% of each of the
Rollover Members’ respective gross proceeds from Class A common stock and Class B common stock) to Parent in exchange for a number of equity
interests of Parent or one or more of its parent entities. The Rollover Members’ contribution of the Rollover Units to Parent in exchange for equity
interests of Parent or one or more of its parent entities will occur immediately prior to the Closing. The obligation of Parent and Parent Merger Sub to

Other members of the Company management team may also be invited to rollover a portion of their equity interests in amounts to be mutually agreed
upon between such member and Parent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent may initiate negotiations of these agreements and/or arrangements, and may

Agreements have also waived rights of appraisal and rights to dissent in connection with the Mergers, and have agreed not to raise certain legal
challenges to the Mergers.
Pursuant to the Voting and Support Agreements, the Voting and Support Agreements stockholders have agreed not to, until the termination of the
acquisition agreement and subject to certain exceptions in the acquisition agreement, directly or indirectly: (1) sell, assign, transfer, tender, pledge, offer,
encumber, hypothecate, loan or otherwise dispose of (including by gift), whether voluntarily or by operation of law or otherwise, any of their shares of

In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to vote in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger, our stockholders should be aware
that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
generally. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in establishing a special committee, in
evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (including the Merger), and in recommending to our stockholders that the Merger Agreement and the Merger be approved. Such
interests are described below. The Merger will be a “change in control” for purposes of the executive compensation agreements described below.
Our executive officers who are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are Rob Roy (Chief Executive Officer), Thomas Morton

As a result, Tom Thomas, Peter Thomas, and their siblings collectively and indirectly hold 20% of the membership interests of each of the Beltway
Entities other than BBP Warehouse 1, in which they collectively and indirectly hold a 15% membership interest. In addition, each Beltway Entity is
managed by Thomas & Mack Beltway, LLC, where Tom Thomas and Peter Thomas serve as the managing members. In September 2017, Thomas & Mack
Beltway, LLC amended its operating agreement to provide that Tom Thomas will not act or make any decisions on behalf of Thomas & Mack Beltway,

The TRA and the TRA Amendment
Concurrent with the initial public offering of its Class A common stock, the Company entered into the TRA with Company Ltd. and the members of
Company Ltd. party thereto. Under the terms of the TRA, absent a change of control of the Company, the Company would generally be required to pay to
members of Company Ltd. party to the TRA 85% of the applicable savings, if any, in income tax that the Company realizes, or that the Company is deemed
to realize, as a result of (1) these tax attributes that are created as a result of the exchanges or redemptions of the such members’ Company Ltd. Common
Units (calculated under certain assumptions), (2) tax benefits related to imputed interest, and (3) payments under the TRA. On May 11, 2022, in
connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Company Ltd. and members of Company Ltd. as of the date of the TRA entered
into, which was concurrently publicly filed, the TRA Amendment, in accordance with the terms of the TRA. The TRA Amendment establishes that the
parties to the TRA (other than the Company) will be entitled to receive a payment in cash from the Company of $0.37 per Company Ltd. Common Unit
(such implied price equating to $5.89 per share of Class A common stock if there were no reduction in the amount of aggregate accelerated change of
control payments required to be made under the then-current terms of the TRA) in connection with the closing of the Mergers in full satisfaction of the
payment obligations to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA. Such payments will be made by the Company as promptly as practicable following the
earlier of (i) the closing of the Mergers (or any other change of control of the Company (as defined in the TRA)), or (ii) December 31, 2022. This
represents a reduction of approximately $1,121 million, which is an approximately 93.72% reduction of the estimated aggregate amount of approximately
$1,196 million that would have otherwise been payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA in respect of a change of control of the Company at the
implied price per share of Class A common stock offered by Parent, absent the TRA Amendment.
Certain directors and members of management of Switch and other persons known by certain executive officers of Switch to be an affiliate or immediate
family member of any of the foregoing and affiliates, as equityholders prior to Switch’s initial public offering, are parties to the TRA, and are entitled to
receive payments pursuant to the TRA and the TRA Amendment in connection with the closing of the Mergers based on the fixed price of $0.37 per
Company Ltd. Common Unit established in the TRA Amendment in the amounts set forth below. For more information, please see the section of this

Severance Benefits",78,79
"Switch, Inc._20220627_DEFM14A_20186829_4481092.Pdf",Severance Benefits,"Severance Benefits
Switch has entered into Executive Severance Agreements with each of its named executive officers, other than Ms. Young (collectively, the “Executive
Severance Agreements”). Each Executive Severance Agreement provides that the executive is eligible to receive certain payments and benefits in the
event of a “qualifying termination” and enhanced payments and benefits in the event of a “change in control termination.” A “qualifying termination”
means a termination for “good reason,” a termination without “cause” or a termination due to death or disability. A “change in control termination” means
a qualifying termination within six months prior to, on or within 24 months following, a “change in control.”
In the event of a “change in control termination,” each executive who is party to an Executive Severance Agreement is entitled to receive the following
payments and benefits:
•
cash severance in an amount equal to the product of: (1) a “severance multiple,” equal to 2.0 for Mr. Roy, 1.5 for Mr. Morton, and 1.0
for Messrs. Nacht and King; and (2) the sum of: (a) the named executive officer’s base salary; and (b) the named executive officer’s
target annual bonus;
•
a pro-rata portion of the executive’s target annual bonus for the calendar year in which the date of termination occurs; and
•
up to 18 months of subsidized COBRA benefits.
In addition, the Executive Severance Agreements provide that upon a “change in control termination,” any unvested time-based equity awards will vest
as of the later of the termination date or the change in control, and the post-termination exercise period for any outstanding vested stock options held by
the named executive officer at the date of termination will be extended through the later of (i) 36 months after his date of termination or (ii) the expiration
date of such stock options. However, as described above, all unvested Switch equity awards will be paid out at the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement.
The receipt of the compensation and benefits under the Executive Severance Agreements is conditioned upon the named executive officer’s execution of
a general release of claims in favor of the Company and compliance with the post-employment confidentiality, non-disparagement, non-competition and
non-solicitation obligations contained therein. The noncompetition and non-solicitation covenants apply during employment and for a period of 12
months and 18 months, respectively, following termination of employment for any reason, except that the noncompetition covenant does not apply
following a “change in control termination.”
Each Executive Severance Agreement includes a so-called “better net after-tax cutback” provision providing that, if the compensation and benefits
payable to the named executive officer in connection with a change in control would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, such
amounts will either be paid in full or reduced to the level that would avoid application of the excise tax, whichever would place the named executive officer
in a better after-tax position.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each continuing Switch employee who is not party to an Executive Severance Agreement and who is terminated by
the Company without cause within the twelve-month period following the closing date will be entitled to receive severance benefits equal to two weeks’
base salary per year of service with the Company and its subsidiaries, up to 26 weeks, subject to the continuing Switch employee’s execution of a release
of claims in favor of the Company.
See the section entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers”
beginning on page 73 of this proxy statement for the estimated amounts that each of our named executive officers would receive upon a qualifying
termination of employment following a change in control of Switch pursuant to his Executive Severance Agreement, or, in the case of Ms. Young,
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each continuing Switch employee who is a participant in an annual cash bonus or other short-term incentive program,
shall be eligible to receive a cash bonus for the year in which the closing occurs, determined as follows: (1) for the portion of the performance period that
has elapsed as of the closing date, the bonus shall be no less than the amount determined by the Compensation Committee of the Switch board of
directors, based on actual achievement of pro-rated performance goals under the applicable bonus programs of Switch, or its subsidiaries, through the
closing date, and pro-rated based on the number of days in the applicable performance period that have elapsed as of the closing date (such amount, the
“Pro-Rata Bonus”) and (2) for the remaining portion of the performance period that follows the closing date, the bonus shall be based on actual
achievement of pro-rated performance goals determined under the bonus programs maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Company, and pro-rated based on the number of days in the applicable performance period that have elapsed following the closing date (collectively, the
“2022 Bonus”). Such 2022 Bonus will be paid by Parent or its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, at the same time that such annual bonuses
are typically paid in the ordinary course of business, subject to the continuing Switch employee’s continued employment through the payment date,
except that if such employee is terminated prior to such payment date by Parent or its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, without cause or
due to disability, then the employee will be entitled to payment of the Pro-Rata Bonus no later than 60 days following such termination date.
See the section entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers”
beginning on page 73 of this proxy statement for the estimated amount of the pro-rated bonus payment that Ms. Young would receive under the terms of
the Merger Agreement.

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information
about certain compensation for each of our named executive officers in connection with the Mergers. For additional details regarding the terms of the
payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption “Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the

The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant
date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before
completion of the Merger. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of our common stock is $34.25, which is the per share merger consideration;
•
The effective time as referenced in this section occurs on May 31, 2022 which is the assumed date of the effective time solely for purposes
of the disclosure in this section; and
•
The employment of each of our named executive officers was terminated by the Surviving Company without “cause” (as such term is
defined in the relevant agreements), in either case immediately following the effective time and on the assumed date of the effective time of

Cash. For each named executive officer other than Ms. Young, consists of (a) cash severance equal to the product of (i) 2.0 for the Chief Executive
Officer, 1.5 for the President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, and 1.0 for the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Revenue Officer and (ii) the sum of:
(A) the named executive officer’s base salary; and (B) the named executive officer’s target annual bonus; and (b) a prorated annual bonus payment

salary, plus (b) a prorated annual bonus payment, each pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (assumed to equal target performance for
purposes of this quantification). The cash severance and the pro-rated annual bonus are “double trigger” and become payable only upon
satisfying a continued employment requirement or upon a qualifying termination of employment following a change in control of Switch under the
terms of the Executive Severance Agreement or, in the case of Ms. Young, the Merger Agreement (see “Interests of the Company’s Directors and

Parent, Parent Merger Sub, the Company, Company Ltd. and Company Merger Sub have covenanted to use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or to cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper and advisable under any applicable laws to receive all approvals by governmental entities,
including in connection with antitrust laws and communications laws. This includes (1) preparing and filing all filings, forms, notices, registrations and
notifications required to be filed to consummate the Mergers, (2) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to consummating the Mergers, (3)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents or orders from any governmental entities, including certain regulatory consents agreed upon by
Parent and the Company to be required, (4) defending any judicial or administrative proceedings challenging the Merger Agreement or the transactions

management of each of the Company and Parent currently believe that the necessary regulatory approvals can be obtained by the end of the second half
of 2022; however, there can be no assurances that such approvals will be obtained in accordance with this timing or at all.
In addition, under the Merger Agreement, Parent and Parent Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps necessary
to eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act and any other antitrust, competition, merger control or foreign investment law that is asserted
by any governmental entity or any other person so as to enable the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as

•
any other condition, commitment, remedy or undertaking of any kind, in each case of the foregoing, in order to obtain any and all actions,
consents and orders from governmental entities as soon as possible and prior to the End Date, including committing to take any and all
actions necessary in order to ensure that no requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent or approval of any governmental entity, no
decree, judgment, decision, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any proceeding and no other matter relating to any
antitrust, competition, merger control or foreign investment law, would preclude the occurrence of the closing prior to the End Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger Agreement does not require Parent or Parent Merger Sub to take or agree to take any action, including any
action contemplated by the foregoing, with respect to any of its affiliates (including any person in which any of its affiliates has any debt or equity
investment and any affiliated or commonly advised investment fund) or any direct or indirect portfolio company (as such term is understood in the
private equity industry) thereof, other than the Company, the Surviving Company, Company Ltd., Surviving Company Ltd. or any of their respective
subsidiaries.
HSR Act
Consummation of the Merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”)
and the rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), which prevent transactions such as the Merger from being consummated until (i)
certain information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the FTC and (ii) the applicable waiting
period is terminated early or expires. Both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division of the DOJ on May 25, 2022. Following discussions between the Company and Parent and the DOJ, Parent withdrew its Notification and Report
Form effective June 24, 2022. Parent plans to refile its Notification and Report Form on June 28, 2022, which will start a new 30-day waiting period with
respect to the Merger under the HSR Act, which cannot expire on a Saturday, Sunday or a U.S. federal holiday. The withdrawal and refiling are standard
procedural steps that provide the DOJ with additional time to complete its review of the proposed Merger. Assuming Parent refiles its Notification and
Report Form on June 28, 2022, the new waiting period will expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on July 28, 2022, unless the FTC or the DOJ earlier terminates
the waiting period or issues requests for additional information and documentary material related to the Merger (“Second Requests”). If the FTC or the
DOJ issues Second Requests, the waiting period with respect to the Merger will be extended for an additional period of 30 calendar days, which will begin
on the date on which both the Company and Parent have substantially complied with their respective Second Requests. Complying with Second
Requests can take a significant period of time. The Company continues to anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the second half of 2022,
assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the Mergers.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the
applicable antitrust authorities could take such action under applicable antitrust laws as each deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances. We cannot assure you that the FTC, DOJ, any state attorney general, or any other U.S. or foreign government authority will not attempt to
challenge the Merger on antitrust grounds, and, if such a challenge is made, we cannot assure you as to its result.
Additional Approvals
In addition, the parties expect to (1) submit a change of control application to the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) for certain wireless
licenses held by the Company, (2) submit an application for and
75
Table of Contents
receive approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), (3) receive authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (“FERC”) with respect to the termination of the market-based rate authorization issued to a subsidiary of the Company and (4) provide
notices to and seek
approvals from certain state regulatory agencies. The consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of these approvals or upon providing
notice, as applicable. The Company and Parent made the appropriate applications with the FCC on May 27, 2022 and with FERC on May 24, 2022,
notifications with each of the Georgia Public Service Commission and Nevada Public Utilities Commission on May 26, 2022 and notifications to the
Nevada Gaming Commission and Michigan Control Gaming Control Board on May 20, 2022. The parties submitted a draft joint voluntary notice (the
“Draft CFIUS Notice”) to CFIUS with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on June 20, 2022. The
parties intend to submit a final joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement in the coming weeks. The Company and Parent also intend to make all required filings under the Exchange Act relating to the Merger and
obtain all other approvals and consents that may be necessary to give effect to the Merger.

The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each as
defined below) of our common stock who receive merger consideration in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger. This
discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of the Merger. The
tax consequences of the Merger under U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable
state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and published rulings, and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations,
and any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions
set forth in this summary. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to
seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. There can be no assurance the
IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the Merger.
This discussion is limited to holders of shares of our common stock who hold such shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the

This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares of our common stock who exercise appraisal rights
in connection with the Merger under the NMA.
If an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership, and certain determinations made at the
partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding our common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.
THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE. HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK
SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO

U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS OTHER THAN THOSE PERTAINING TO INCOME TAX, INCLUDING ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY
STATE, LOCAL, OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
Definition of a U.S. Holder
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is
treated as:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the
District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
•
a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a
“United States person” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Effect of the Merger
The receipt of merger consideration by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of our common stock in the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of any taxable gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder who receives merger consideration for shares of our
common stock in the Merger will generally equal the difference, if any, between the amount of merger consideration received for such shares (determined
before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a
share will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for such share. The amount and character of such gain or loss and the holding period of
shares will be determined separately for each block of shares of our common stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction)
exchanged for merger consideration in the Merger. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder upon the receipt of merger consideration in exchange for a
share of our common stock in the Merger will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such
share for more than one year at the effective time of the Merger. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss which is subject to
U.S. federal income tax at the same rates as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including
individuals, are generally taxable at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS
and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an
exemption should complete and return to the paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal certifying that such
holder is a United States person, that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such holder is not subject to backup withholding.
Certain holders (including corporations) are not subject to backup withholding or information reporting rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from payments of merger consideration to a U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger under
the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against such U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from
backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity or
arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Effect of the Merger
A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of merger consideration in exchange for
shares of our common stock in the Merger unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, such gain is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base,
maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States);
•
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the
disposition of shares of our common stock in the Merger, and certain other requirements are met; or
78
Table of Contents
•
we are or have been a U.S. real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the
shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held shares of our common stock (the
“relevant period”) and the non-U.S. holder held (actually or constructively) more than 5% of the total fair market value of all shares of our
common stock at any time during such five-year period.
Gain described in the first bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular U.S. federal income
tax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits
tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on after-tax profits effectively connected with a U.S.
trade or business to the extent that such after-tax profits are not reinvested and maintained in the business.
A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as
may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on gain realized upon the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock, which may be
offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the
non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.
With respect to the third bullet point above, generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests equals or
exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. We
may be a USRPHC, and if we are a USRPHC, gain arising from the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder generally
will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if our common stock is “regularly traded on an established securities market,” as defined by applicable
Treasury Regulations, and such non-U.S. holder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common stock throughout the shorter of the five-
year period ending on the date of the sale or other taxable disposition and the non-U.S. holder’s holding period. We believe that our Class A common
stock is currently treated as regularly traded on an established securities market, but we cannot guarantee that our Class A common stock will continue to
be treated as regularly traded on an established securities market through the closing of the Merger. If gain on the sale or other taxable disposition of
shares of our common stock were subject to taxation under the third bullet point above, the non-U.S. holder would be subject to regular U.S. federal
income tax with respect to such gain in generally the same manner as a United States person, and the non-U.S. holder would be required to file a U.S. tax
return with respect to such gain. In addition, if shares of our common stock were not regularly traded on an established securities market, the acquirer of
such common stock would generally be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 15% of the purchase price, which withholding would be creditable
against any income tax liability described in the previous sentence and generally refundable to the extent in excess thereof. Non-U.S. holders should
consult their advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences that could result from our status as a USRPHC and regarding potentially applicable
income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made to non-U.S. holders in the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%).
Non-U.S. holders generally can avoid information reporting and backup withholding by providing the paying agent with an applicable and properly
executed IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, or W-8ECI (or successor form), as the case may be, certifying under penalties of perjury the holder’s non-U.S.
status (and the payor or applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person as
defined under the Code) or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under
an applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a
non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

In connection with the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the guarantees, Parent has entered into guarantees with
DigitalBridge and IFM GIF in our favor, pursuant to which DigitalBridge and IFM GIF have guaranteed their respective portions of Parent’s payment
obligations with respect to the parent termination fee under the merger Agreement and certain collection costs related thereto (collectively, the
“guaranteed obligation”) if and when due in accordance with the Merger Agreement, subject to an aggregate cap of $415.8 million for DigitalBridge and
an aggregate cap of $277.2 million for IFM GIF for payment of the guaranteed obligations. The maximum aggregate liability of the guarantors under the
guarantees will not exceed $693 million.
Each guarantee is irrevocable, and will not terminate until the earliest to occur of (i) the fulfillment of Parent and Parent Merger Sub’s respective
obligations under the Merger Agreement to fund the merger consideration at the Effective Time, (ii) receipt by the Company of payment in full of the
guaranteed obligation, (iii) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms under circumstances in which Parent would not be
obligated to make any payments with respect to any of the guaranteed obligation, (iv) 60 days following any valid termination of the Merger Agreement
in accordance with its terms under circumstances in which Parent would be obligated to make any payments with respect to any of the guaranteed
obligations; provided that, in the case of clause (iv), if the Company has made a claim under an applicable guarantee prior to such date, then the earliest
of (w) a final, non-appealable order resolving such claim determining that Parent does not have any liability to the Company that gives rise to the
guaranteed obligation, (x) payment of the amounts due and owing in respect of the guaranteed obligation as determined in a final, non-appealable order
resolving such claim and (y) a written agreement among the applicable guarantor and the Company terminating the obligations of such guarantor
pursuant to the applicable guarantee). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company or any of its controlled affiliates, and any person
claiming by, through or on behalf of any of them, asserts in any litigation or other proceeding that the provisions of the guarantee limiting the guarantor’s
liability to the cap set forth therein or that the continuing guarantee and non-recourse provisions set forth in Section 8 or Section 9 of the applicable
guarantee are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, or asserts any theory of liability whatsoever (whether at law or in equity, whether
sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) against any non-recourse party with respect to the applicable guarantee, the Merger Agreement or the
equity commitment letter (collectively, the “Transaction Agreements”) or any other agreement or instrument delivered pursuant to such Transaction
Agreements, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than specified excluded claims asserted by the Company against the applicable
guarantor or the non-recourse party(ies) against which such excluded claims may be asserted pursuant to the terms of the applicable guarantor, then (A)
the obligations of the guarantor under or in connection with the applicable guarantee will terminate ab initio and be null and void, (B) if the guarantor has
previously made any payments under the guarantee, it will be entitled to recover such payments, and (C) neither the guarantor nor any other non-
recourse party will have any liability whatsoever (whether at law or in equity, whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) to the Company or
any other person in any way under or in connection with any Transaction Agreement, any other agreement or instrument

delivered pursuant to such Transaction Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by the guarantee or by the Transaction Agreements.
The Merger Agreement provides that the parties are entitled to specific performance, including specific performance of Parent’s and Parent Merger Sub’s
obligations to consummate the Mergers. However, we, Company Merger Sub and Company Ltd. may only seek specific performance to require Parent or
Parent Merger Sub to consummate the Mergers if certain conditions are met, including (1) Parent and Parent Merger Sub’s closing conditions under the
Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing or the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by a
breach by Parent or Parent Merger Sub of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement) have been
satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied at the closing) or (to the extent permissible under applicable law) waived, (2) the full amount of the initial
mortgage loans (or alternative financing) contemplated in connection with the Merger Agreement has been funded or would be funded at closing if the
equity financing contemplated by the equity commitment letters (the “Equity Financing”) in connection with the Merger Agreement were funded at the
closing, (3) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and the initial mortgage loans (or alternative financing) are funded, then the Company stands ready, willing and able to then consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement on such date, (4) Parent and Parent Merger Sub have failed to complete the closing by the date the closing is
required under the Merger Agreement and (5) the Merger Agreement has not been terminated. Under no circumstances will we be permitted or entitled to
both a grant of specific performance causing the closing to occur or any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of the parent
termination fee, on the other hand.",88,89

If the Company stockholder approval is obtained, the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law)
waived and the Mergers are consummated, Parent Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company and Company Merger Sub will be merged with
and into Company Ltd., in each case upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. As the Surviving Company in the Merger, the Company will
continue to exist following the Merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; as the Surviving Company Ltd., Company Ltd. will continue to exist
following the Merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Surviving Company.
At the Effective Time, each share of Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than excluded shares)
will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $34.25 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Following the Merger,
all of the Class A common stock will be beneficially owned by Parent, and none of the current holders of Class A common stock will, by virtue of the
Merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the Company, the Surviving Company. The Merger Agreement further provides that, at
the Effective Time, each share of Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled
and will cease to exist, and each holder of Class B common stock will no longer have any rights with respect to these shares, subject to (1) the right of the
holder of any related Company Ltd. Common Units, other than any Rollover Member with respect to its Rollover Units, to receive the merger
consideration and (2) applicable law in the case of dissenting shares. As a result, the current holders of Class A common stock and Class B common
stock will no longer benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of the Company. Following the Merger,
Parent will benefit from any increase in the Company’s value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in the Company’s value.

In the event that the Company stockholder approval is not obtained or if the Mergers are not consummated for any other reason, Switch stockholders will
not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the Mergers. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public
company, the Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NYSE, the Class A common stock will continue to be registered under the
Exchange Act and the Company’s stockholders will continue to own their shares of common stock and will continue to be subject to the same general
risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of the common stock.
If the Mergers are not consummated, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your common stock,
including the risk that the market price of Class A common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of the Class A common stock
reflects a market assumption that the Mergers will be consummated. If the Mergers are not consummated, there is no assurance that any other transaction
reflects a market assumption that the Mergers will be consummated. If the Mergers are not consummated, there is no assurance that any other transaction
acceptable to the Company will be offered or that the business, operations, financial condition, earnings or prospects of the Company will not be
adversely impacted. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances the Company is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement in
order to enter into an alternative transaction. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination of the Merger

certain affiliates of the Company, DigitalBridge and IFM Investors Pty Ltd and alleges, among other things, that our board of directors breached their
fiduciary duties in approving the Merger, and that DigitalBridge and IFM Investors Pty Ltd aided and abetted such breaches. The O’Dell Action,

intends to vigorously defend against them.

Under sections 92A.300 to 92A.500, inclusive, of the NMA, stockholders of a Nevada corporation may, subject to certain conditions, be entitled to
dissent from a transaction and demand payment of the fair value of
82Table of Contents
such stockholder’s shares in the event of certain corporate actions, including certain mergers. However, there is no such right of dissent for stockholders
of a class or series of stock that is a “covered security” under section 18(b)(1)(A) or (B) of the Securities Act. The Class A common stock is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, a national securities exchange, and, consequently is a “covered security” within the meaning of Section 18(b)(1)(A) of the
Securities Act. Therefore, the holders of Class A common stock do not have the right, under the NMA, to dissent from, or demand payment for their
shares in connection with, the Merger.
Shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any stockholder entitled to demand, and
who does properly and timely demand, pursuant to the NMA and a separate notice provided by the Company, payment for such shares (“dissenting
shares”) will be treated in accordance with the NMA. At the Effective Time, all dissenting shares will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist,
and stockholders who properly exercised their dissenters’ rights will have the right to receive the fair value of the dissenting shares in accordance with
the NMA. If any dissenting stockholder loses its status as a dissenter under the NMA, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the date this status
was lost, such stockholder’s shares of Class B common stock will be converted into, or will have been deemed to have been converted into at the
Effective Time, as applicable, the right to receive only the merger consideration (without interest thereon) with respect to that holder’s related Company
Ltd. Common Units. For the avoidance of doubt, no dissenters’ or appraisal rights are available with respect to the Company Ltd. Common Units. A copy
of the full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500 is included as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of

procedures set forth in NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500 will result in the forfeiture of dissenter’s rights.
Any holder of Class B common stock who wishes to dissent must, before the vote is taken, deliver to Switch a statement of intent with respect to the
Mergers and must not vote, or cause or permit to be voted, any of his or her shares of Class B common stock in favor of the Mergers.

Prior to the closing date, Parent will designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Exchange Agent”) for
payment of the merger consideration and will enter into an agreement with the exchange agent on or prior to the closing date. At or immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving Company
will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates that, (1) immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
outstanding common stock or that, (2) immediately prior to the LLC Merger Effective Time, represented applicable Company Ltd. Common Units (each, a
“Company Certificate”), a letter of transmittal and instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for the merger consideration to
which the holder is entitled.
Upon surrender of a Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of the Company Certificate will be entitled to receive the merger consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Company Certificate. Each of Parent, Parent Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, Surviving Company Ltd., Switch,
Company Ltd., Company Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment (and, with respect to our equity awards, the vesting, cancellation or redemption of such equity awards, as applicable) under applicable law, and
such amounts deducted or withheld will be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which deduction or withholding was made.
Holders of book-entry common stock or book-entry Company Ltd. Common Units will not receive a letter of transmittal for their common stock or units
from the Exchange Agent. Instead, holders of such book-entry common stock or book-entry units, other than any holder of dissenting shares, will
automatically be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the merger consideration to which the holder is entitled, without interest. As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving Company will cause the
Exchange Agent to issue to each such holder the aggregate cash consideration that such holder is entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of common stock or Company Ltd. Common Units held by Members of Company Ltd. prior to the
Effective Time that is not registered in the transfer records of Switch or Company Ltd., as applicable, as of the Effective Time, it will be a condition of
payment that any Company Certificate surrendered in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement must be properly endorsed or must be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and any book-entry common stock or book-entry Company Ltd. Common Units must be properly transferred, and
that the person requesting the payment must have paid any transfer taxes required by reason of the payment of the consideration to a person other than
the registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered or the book-entry common stock or book-entry Company Ltd. Common

registration of transfers of common stock or Company Ltd. Common Units.
None of Parent, Parent Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, Surviving Company Ltd., Switch, Company Ltd., Company Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent nor any employee, officer, director, agent, or affiliate of such persons will be liable to any person, including any holder of common stock or
Company Ltd. Common Units with respect to the cash consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such common stock or units immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any governmental entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Company, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto.
If any Company Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent
or Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the merger consideration, as applicable, to be paid in
respect of common stock or Company Ltd. Common Units formerly represented by such Company Certificate in accordance with terms of the Merger
Agreement.
Any portion of the merger consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of common stock or Company Ltd. Common Units that are entitled to such consideration after the first anniversary of
the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any such former holders of common stock or Company Ltd. Common
Units will thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment, without interest and upon compliance with the procedures set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

Merger Agreement with a record date prior to the Effective Time or the LLC Merger Effective Time, respectively, and has not been paid prior to the
Effective Time or the LLC Merger Effective Time, respectively, then the applicable holders shall be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution from
Switch or Company Ltd., as applicable, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or the LLC Merger Effective Time, as applicable.

We have agreed that, from and after the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time (or, if earlier, when the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms), except as permitted by certain
100Table of Contents
exceptions described below, we will immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent and Parent Merger Sub) that
may be ongoing as of the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to a company takeover proposal and request that each person (other than Parent,
Parent Merger Sub and their representatives) that has received confidential information on or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement in connection
with its consideration of a company takeover proposal to promptly return or destroy all such information, and we have agreed to terminate access to all
data rooms furnished in connection therewith.
We have further agreed that we will not, will cause each of our subsidiaries and our and their respective officers and directors to not, and will instruct and
use our reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective other representatives not to directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any proposal or offer or any inquiries regarding the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a company takeover proposal;
•
engage or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any confidential information or

constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a company takeover proposal; or
•
approve, recommend or enter into, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any acquisition agreement.
We have agreed that neither us nor any of our subsidiaries will terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of an existing standstill or similar
agreement to which we or one of our subsidiaries is a party, except that prior to obtaining Switch stockholder approval, if after consultation with, and
taking into account the advice of outside legal counsel, our board of directors or the special committee determines that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, we may waive any such standstill provision solely to the extent necessary
to permit a person to make, on a confidential basis, to our board of directors or the special committee, a company takeover proposal.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “company takeover proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer (whether or not in writing) made by any
person or group of persons (other than Parent and its subsidiaries and affiliates), and whether involving a transaction or series of related transactions, for
any direct or indirect:
•
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
Switch;
•
tender offer or exchange offer by any person or group of persons (other than Parent, Parent Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) of
more than 20% of the shares of Switch common stock then issued and outstanding;
•
acquisition by any person or group of persons (other than Parent, Parent Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) of more than 20% of the
assets of Switch and its subsidiaries (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by our board or the special
committee), revenues or net income of Switch and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (including securities of the subsidiaries of
Switch); or
•
acquisition by any person or group of persons (other than Parent, Parent Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) of more than 20% of the
shares of Switch common stock then issued and outstanding, other than the Mergers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger by our stockholders, if we or any of our subsidiaries receive a company
takeover proposal from any person that did not result from a breach of the obligations described in this section entitled “— Restriction on Solicitation of
Company Takeover Proposals,” and if our board of directors or the special committee, after consultation with its independent
101
Table of Contents
financial advisors, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that such company takeover proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the director’s fiduciary duties
under applicable law, then we and our representatives may:
•
enter into an acceptable confidentiality agreement with the person making such company takeover proposal and thereafter furnish, pursuant
thereto, information (including non-public information) with respect to Switch and its subsidiaries to the person that has made such
company takeover proposal and its representatives (provided, that we will, substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person,
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning us or any of our subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or
its representatives unless such non-public information has been previously provided to Parent); and
•
engage in or and otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such company takeover proposal and its
representatives regarding such company takeover proposal.
We are required to notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) after we, any of our subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives
becomes aware of any company takeover proposal or any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to us or our subsidiaries that would be reasonably likely to
lead to or that contemplates a company takeover proposal and will disclose to Parent the material terms and conditions of any such company takeover
proposal and copies of any written company takeover proposal, including proposed agreements, and the identity of the person making such company
takeover proposal. We are also required to keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis (but in any event within 48 hours), as to the
status of such company takeover proposal, offer, proposal or inquiry and any material changes thereto, including copies of any changes to any written
company takeover proposal, including proposed agreements. We have agreed that we and our subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality
agreements with any person after the date of the Merger Agreement that prohibits us or our subsidiaries from providing any information to Parent.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “superior proposal” means a bona fide written company takeover proposal that if consummated would result in
any person (other than Parent or its affiliates) owning more than 50% of each class of common stock that our board of directors or the special committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, the special committee’s financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account such factors as our board of directors or special committee considers to be appropriate, to be more favorable to the
Company and our stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

We refer to any action described in the first three bullet points above as a “company adverse recommendation change.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger by our stockholders, our board of directors or the special committee may, if
our board of directors or the special committee has determined in good faith, after consultation with and taking into account the advice of its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
under applicable law, make a company adverse recommendation change in response to an intervening event; provided, that prior to making such
company adverse recommendation change:
•
we have given Parent a written notice of our intention to take such action specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and the
underlying facts giving rise thereto (a “Company Notice”); and
•
during the period from the delivery of the Company Notice until 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, on the fourth (4th) business day after the day on
which the Company delivered the Company Notice, if requested by Parent, we will and will cause our representatives to, engage in good
faith negotiations with Parent and its representatives regarding any changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement so that such intervening
event would cease to warrant a company adverse recommendation change.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, an “intervening event” means any event that is (1) neither known by, nor reasonably foreseeable (with respect to
magnitude or material consequences) by our board of directors or the special committee as of or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement and (2) first
occurs, arises or becomes known to our board of directors or the special committee after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to obtaining the
stockholder approval; provided, that none of the foregoing shall constitute an intervening event: (A) any event, change, effect, condition, development,
fact or circumstance (i) relating to any company takeover proposal or (ii) resulting from (I) the announcement, pendency and consummation of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (II) any actions required to be taken or to be refrained from being taken pursuant to the Merger
Agreement or (III) a breach of the Merger Agreement by the Company, Company Merger Sub, or Company Ltd., (B) the fact that the Company meets or
exceeds any internal or analysts’ expectations or projections or (C) any changes after the date of the Merger Agreement in our market price or trading
volume (it being understood however, in each case of subclause (B) and (C), that any underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether an intervening event has occurred to the extent otherwise qualifying as an intervening event).
In addition, prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger by our stockholders, if our board of directors or the special committee has determined in good
faith, after consultation with and taking into account the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that a written company takeover
proposal that did not result from a breach of provisions described above under “— Restriction on Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals”)
constitutes a superior proposal, our board of directors or the special committee may (1) make a company adverse recommendation change and/or (2)
cause the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an acquisition agreement relating to such superior proposal, subject to the
Company paying the company termination fee to Parent; provided, that prior to so making a company adverse recommendation change or terminating the
Merger Agreement, (A) we have delivered a Company Notice to Parent, including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person
making such superior proposal, a copy of the superior proposal and a copy of any proposed acquisition agreements, (B) during the period from the
delivery of the Company Notice until 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, on the fourth (4th) business day following delivery of the Company Notice (which, for
purposes of calculating such four (4) business day period, the first business day will be the first business day after the date of such delivery) (the
“Notice Period”), if requested by Parent, we will and will cause our representatives to, engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
representatives regarding any changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement so that such company takeover proposal ceases to constitute a superior
proposal and (C) after the expiration of the Notice Period, our board of directors or the special committee determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the superior proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a superior proposal.
We have agreed
103
Table of Contents
that any changes in the financial terms or any other material amendment to the terms and conditions of such superior proposal will require a new
Company Notice and a new two (2) business day Notice Period (which will be calculated in the same manner as the initial four (4) business day period,
will end at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time at the end of such two (2) business day period, and will not reduce the initial four (4) business day period).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and our board of directors and special committee are not prohibited from taking and disclosing to our
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any “stop, look and listen” communication to our stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (and the issuance by the
Company or our board of directors of a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of our position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, will not constitute a company adverse recommendation change); provided that neither the Company nor our board
of directors or the special committee will be permitted to recommend that our stockholders tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or
exchange offer that is a company takeover proposal or otherwise effect a company adverse recommendation change with respect thereto, subject to
certain exceptions.",110,112

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, with respect to each individual who is an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a “Company employee”), for a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time (and in the case of clause (4), for the
applicable period following termination of such Company employee’s employment), (1) base salary or wages at a rate that is no less favorable than the
rate of base salary or wages provided to such Company employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (2) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no
less favorable in amount than the annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Company employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (3) an
annual long-term incentive award opportunity that is substantially similar to the annual long-term incentive award opportunity provided to such
Company employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (4) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits set forth in the
Merger Agreement, and (5) other employee benefits (other than equity incentives) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other
employee benefits provided to such Company employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent has agreed to pay to each Company employee who is a participant in an annual cash bonus or other short-term incentive program maintained by
us or any of our subsidiaries for the year in which the closing occurs a cash bonus under the Company’s bonus programs for such year in which the
closing occurs subject to the achievement of certain performance goals, to be paid at the time that we typically pay annual bonuses in the ordinary
course of business.
With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries following the closing of the Mergers
and in which any of the Company employees participate, including any paid time off and severance plans, Parent has agreed that service with the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and the predecessor of any of them will be treated as service with Parent or any of its subsidiaries, for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable) and entitlement to (or level of ) benefits (but not for accrual of or entitlement to pension
benefits or post-employment welfare benefits, or to the extent that treatment would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service).
Parent has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to (1) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to
each Company employee and his or her eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent that provides health benefits in which such
Company employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such Company
employee and his or her eligible dependents immediately prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding benefit plan of the Company, (2) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by such Company employee and his or her eligible dependents under the health plans in
which they
104Table of Contents
participated immediately prior to transitioning into a plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent during the portion of the calendar year prior to such transition
in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent or an affiliate of Parent and (3) waive any waiting
period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Company employee and his or her eligible dependents
on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such Company employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous benefit plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries who is a participant in an annual cash bonus or other short-
term incentive program, shall be eligible to receive a cash bonus for such year in which the closing occurs. Such cash bonus shall be calculated as
follows: (1) for the portion of the performance period that has elapsed as of the closing date, the bonus shall be no less than the amount determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Company’s board of directors based on actual achievement of pro-rated performance goals under the applicable
bonus programs of the Company, or its subsidiaries, through the closing date, as determined immediately prior to the closing, and pro-rated based on the
number of days in the applicable performance period that have elapsed as of the closing (the “Pro-Rata Bonus”) and (2) for the remaining portion of the
performance period that follows the closing date for the fiscal year in which the closing occurs, the bonus shall be based on actual achievement of pro-
rated performance goals determined under the bonus programs maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries, and pro-rated based on the number of days in the
applicable performance period that have elapsed following the closing date (collectively, the “2022 Bonus”). Such 2022 Bonus will be paid by Parent or its
subsidiaries, at the same time that such annual bonuses are typically paid in the ordinary course of business, subject to the continuing employee’s
continued employment through the payment date, provided that, a Company employee who is terminated by Parent or its affiliates, without cause or due
to disability, in either case, prior to the normal bonus payment date shall be entitled to receive the Pro-Rata Bonus within 60 days of his or her termination

existing policies of the Company and its subsidiaries or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage, and the
Surviving Company and Surviving Company Ltd. must maintain such directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary insurance policies in full
force and effect for each of their full six year terms and continue to honor their respective obligations under each policy; provided, that in no event will

Payment of Termination Fee
In no event will a termination fee be payable by the Company or Parent on more than one occasion.
In the event the Merger Agreement is validly terminated and the parent termination fee is paid under the circumstances for which such fee is payable
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, payment of the parent termination fee will be the sole and exclusive monetary damages remedy available to the
Company in respect of any and all losses incurred as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be
consummated and, upon payment of such termination fee in such circumstances, none of Parent and its related parties will have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of the Merger Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
If the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay its termination fee and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, commences an action which results in a final and non-appealable judgment against the other party for the payment, then the paying party
must pay the other party its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) in connection with
such proceeding, together with interest on that amount from and including the date payment of such amount was due but excluding the date of actual
payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2% per annum.
Guarantees and Remedies
In connection with the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the guarantees, Parent has entered into guarantees with
DigitalBridge and IFM GIF in our favor, pursuant to which DigitalBridge and IFM GIF have guaranteed their respective portions of Parent’s payment
obligations with respect to the parent termination fee under the merger Agreement and certain collection costs related thereto (collectively, the
“guaranteed obligation”) if and when due in accordance with the Merger Agreement, subject to an aggregate cap of $415.8 million for DigitalBridge and
an aggregate cap of $277.2 million for IFM GIF for payment of the guaranteed obligations. The maximum aggregate liability of the guarantors under the
guarantees will not exceed $693 million.
The Merger Agreement provides that the parties are entitled to specific performance, including specific performance of Parent’s and Parent Merger Sub’s
obligations to consummate the Mergers. However, we,

Company Merger Sub and Company Ltd. may only seek specific performance to require Parent or Parent Merger Sub to consummate the Mergers if
certain conditions are met, including (1) Parent and Parent Merger Sub’s closing conditions under the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing or the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by a breach by Parent or Parent Merger Sub of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement) have been satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied at the
closing) or (to the extent permissible under applicable law) waived, (2) the full amount of the initial mortgage loans (or alternative financing) contemplated
in connection with the Merger Agreement has been funded or would be funded at closing if the equity financing contemplated by the equity commitment

Equity Financing is funded at closing). Under no circumstances will we be permitted or entitled to both a grant of specific performance causing the

The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock for:
•
each person known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock;
•
each of our directors, each of whom is also a nominee;
•
each of our named executive officers (“NEOs”); and
•
all of our current executive officers and directors as a group.
We have three classes of common stock: Class A common stock; Class B common stock; and Class C common stock. There are no shares of Class C
common stock currently outstanding. Subject to the Company Ltd. operating agreement, Members can redeem Company Ltd. Common Units for Class A
common stock on a one-to-one basis, or, at our option, for cash equal to the market value of the applicable number of our shares of Class A common
stock. Thus, the Company Ltd. Common Units represent rights to acquire Class A common stock. The shares of Class B common stock (i) confer only
voting rights and do not confer any incidents of economic ownership to the holders thereof; and (ii) are forfeited and cancelled, on a one-for-one basis,
without consideration, upon the redemption of the Company Ltd. Common Units for shares of Class A common stock, or cash, at our election.
The number of shares beneficially owned by each stockholder is based on shares as to which the individual or entity has sole or shared voting power or
investment power. Applicable percentage ownership and voting power is based on 150,767,439 shares of Class A common stock and 94,131,279 shares of
Class B common stock outstanding as of June 15, 2022. There were no shares of Class C common stock outstanding as of June 15, 2022. In computing the
number and the percentage ownership and voting power of a stockholder, rights to acquire shares of Class A common stock as of June 15, 2022 or within
60 days of June 15, 2022, including upon vesting and exercise of stock options, upon vesting of time-based restricted stock unit awards and performance-
based restricted stock unit awards, or upon exercise of the stockholder’s Company Ltd. Common Unit redemption right, are considered outstanding for
that stockholder, although these shares are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership or voting power of any
other stockholder. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of all listed stockholders is 7135 S. Decatur Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118. Each of the
stockholders listed has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by the stockholder unless noted otherwise,
subject to community property laws where applicable.

DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS",125,129
"Switch, Inc._20220627_DEFM14A_20186829_4481092.Pdf",DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS,"DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS
Under certain circumstances, stockholders of a Nevada corporation may, pursuant to the NMA, be entitled to dissent from a transaction and demand
payment of the fair value of such stockholder’s shares in the event of certain corporate actions, including certain mergers. However, holders of Class A
common stock do not have such dissenters’ rights.
Shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any stockholder entitled to demand, and
who properly and timely, pursuant to the NMA and a separate notice from the Company, demands payment for such shares under the NMA will be
treated in accordance with the NMA. At the Effective Time, all such dissenting shares will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist, and holders
of dissenting shares will have the right to receive the fair value of the dissenting shares in accordance with the NMA. If any dissenting stockholder loses
its status as dissenter under the NMA, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the date this status was lost, these shares will be converted into, or will
have been deemed to have been converted into at the Effective Time, as applicable, the right to receive merger consideration with respect to that holder’s
related Company Ltd. Common Units.
Any holder of Class B common stock who wishes to dissent must, before the vote is taken, deliver to Switch a statement of intent with respect to the
Mergers and must not vote, or cause or permit to be voted, any of his or her shares of Class B common stock in favor of the Mergers.
Under Nevada Revised Statues, or NRS, 92A.300 to 92A.500, holders of Switch Class B common stock are entitled to assert dissenter’s rights under NRS
92A.300 to 92A.500. If such a holder properly exercises his or her dissenter’s rights, such Class B common stockholder may demand payment for their
shares of Class B common stock of its fair value immediately before the corporate action. If Switch and any holder of Class B common stock that properly
exercises dissenter’s rights cannot agree on a fair value, Switch must then commence an appraisal process in state court to determine the fair value.
NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500 describe the appraisal process and the procedure holders of Class B common stock must follow to exercise their right to
dissent and demand payment. The full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. All references in NRS 92A.300 to
92A.500 to a “stockholder” or “dissenter” and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holders of the shares of Switch Class B common
stock. The following discussion is a summary of the law pertaining to dissenter’s rights under the NRS:
•
When a corporate action subject to dissenter’s rights is submitted to a vote at a stockholders’ meeting, the corporation must state whether
or not the stockholders are entitled to assert dissenter’s rights under NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, along with a copy of that statute
describing these rights. A corporation only needs to notify stockholders of record who are entitled to dissenter’s rights, not all beneficial
owners.
•
If the corporate action is submitted to a vote at a stockholders’ meeting, any stockholders wishing to dissent must first deliver to the
corporation a statement, before the vote is taken, of their intent with respect to the proposed corporate action. Second, a stockholder
intending to assert dissenter’s rights must not vote any of their shares of the class or series to which dissenter’s rights are available in
favor of the proposed action.
•
If the corporation receives requisite stockholder approval for the proposed action, it must then deliver a written dissenter’s notice to all
stockholders of record who are entitled to assert their dissenter’s rights within 10 days of the effective date of the corporate action. The
dissenter’s notice must:
•
State where the demand for payment must be sent and where and when share certificates, if any, must be deposited;
•
Inform the holders of shares not represented by certificates the extent to which the transfer of the shares will be restricted after the
corporation receives the demand for payment;
121Table of Contents
•
Supply a form for demanding payment that includes the date of the first announcement to the news media or to the stockholders of
the terms of the proposed action and requires that the person asserting dissenters’ rights certify whether or not they acquired
beneficial ownership of the shares before that date;
•
Set a date by which the corporation must receive the demand for payment, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60
days after the date the notice is delivered;
•
State that the stockholder shall be deemed to have waived the right to demand payment with respect to the shares unless the form is
received by the corporation by the specified date; and
•
Be accompanied by a copy of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500.
•
Holders of Class B common stock who receive a dissenter’s notice and who wish to continue with the appraisal process must then:
•
Demand payment;
•
Certify that they were beneficial owners prior to the date specified in the dissenter’s notice; and
•
Deposit the stockholder’s certificates, if any, in accordance with the terms of the notice.
•
Alternatively, holders of Class B common stock may withdraw from the appraisal process by notifying the corporation in writing by the date
specified in the dissenter’s notice. After this date, dissenters may withdraw only with the written consent of the corporation.
•
Once dissenting stockholders deposit the stockholder’s certificates (or, in the case of uncertified shares, makes a demand for payment),
they lose all rights as a holder of Class B common stock, unless they later withdraw from the appraisal process. The corporation may restrict
the transfer of uncertified shares from the date the corporation receives the dissenters’ demand for payment.
•
Within 30 days of receiving demand for payment, the corporation must pay dissenters an amount the corporation estimates to be the fair
value of the dissenter’s share, plus accrued interest. This payment must be accompanied by:
•
The corporation’s balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year ending not more than 16 months before the date of payment, a statement
of income for that year, a statement of changes in the stockholders’ equity for that year or, whether such financial statements are not
reasonably available, then such reasonably equivalent financial information and the latest available quarterly financial statements, if
not reasonably available, then such reasonably equivalent financial information and the latest available quarterly financial statements,
if any;
•
A statement of the corporation’s estimate of the fair value of the shares; and
•
A statement of the dissenter’s rights to contest the corporation’s estimate of fair value.
•
If dissenting stockholders wish to contest the corporation’s estimate of fair value, they must notify the corporation in writing within 30 days
of receiving the corporation’s initial payment. Dissenters must provide their own estimate of fair value plus interest and demand that the
corporation pay the difference between this estimate and the corporation’s estimate.
•
The corporation must either pay the additional amount or commence judicial proceedings within 60 days of receiving the demand and
petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest.
A copy of the full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500 is included as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of
dissenters’ rights set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500. Failure to follow the
procedures set forth in NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500 will result in the forfeiture of dissenter’s rights.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS",129,131
"Switch, Inc._20220627_DEFM14A_20186829_4481092.Pdf",STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS,"STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
Stockholders who intend to have a proposal considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for presentation at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or pursuant to our proxy access provisions must submit the proposal to our Secretary at our offices at
7135 S. Decatur Blvd., Las Vegas, Nevada 89118 not later than December 29, 2022.
Stockholders intending to present a proposal at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, but not to include the proposal in our proxy statement, or to
nominate a person for election as a director, must comply with the requirements set forth in our bylaws. Our bylaws require, among other things, that our
Secretary receive written notice from the stockholder of record of their intent to present such proposal or nomination not earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting.
Therefore, we must receive notice of such a proposal or nomination for the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders no earlier than the close of business on
February 10, 2023 and no later than the close of business on March 12, 2023. The notice must contain the information required by our bylaws, a copy of
which is available upon request to our Secretary. In the event that the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days before or
more than 70 days after June 10, 2023, then our Secretary must receive such written notice not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to
the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders or, if
later, the 10th day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made by us. SEC rules permit management to vote
proxies in its discretion in certain cases if the stockholder does not comply with this deadline and, in certain other cases notwithstanding the
stockholder’s compliance with this deadline.
Our bylaws require that any stockholder nominations for director candidates under our proxy access provisions must be received by us not later than the
close of business on the 120th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day, prior to the first anniversary of the date we first distributed our
definitive proxy statement to stockholders for the preceding year’s annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual
meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after the anniversary date of the preceding year’s annual meeting, notice by the stockholder
must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the
later of the 120th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first
made by us. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend
any time period) for the giving of the proxy access notice as described in our bylaws. Therefore, we must receive notice of such a proposal or nomination
for the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders no earlier than the close of business on November 29, 2022 and no later than the close of business on
December 29, 2022. In the event that the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after June 10,
2023, then our Secretary must receive such written notice not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to such annual meeting and not
later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public disclosure of
the date of such meeting is first made by us. Use of the proxy access process to submit stockholder nominees is subject to additional eligibility,
procedural and disclosure requirements set forth in our bylaws.
We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these or other
applicable requirements.

HOUSEHOLDING",131,132
"Switch, Inc._20220627_DEFM14A_20186829_4481092.Pdf",HOUSEHOLDING,"HOUSEHOLDING
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as banks and brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy
statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to
those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost
savings for companies.
A number of banks and brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be householding our proxy materials. A single copy of the Notice or
proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected
stockholders. Once you have received notice from your bank or broker that it will be householding communications to your address, householding will
continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would
prefer to receive a separate copy of the Notice or proxy statement, please notify your bank or broker. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies
of the Notice or proxy statement and annual report at their address and would like to request householding of their communications should contact their
bank or broker.
If you are a stockholder of record eligible for householding, but you and other stockholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive
multiple copies of the Notice or proxy statement, or if you hold stock in more than one account, and in either case you wish to receive only a single copy
of the Notice or proxy statement for your household, please contact our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (by email:
help@astfinancial.com, or by telephone: 1-800-937-5449). If you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of the Notice or proxy
statement and annual report, or if you do not wish to participate in householding and prefer to receive separate copies of the Notice or proxy statement
and annual report in the future, please contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company as indicated above.

with respect to, settle or offer to settle, waive any failure to timely deliver any demand or otherwise to comply with the NMA, or approve any withdrawal

available with respect to the Company Class A Common Stock, the Company Class C Common Stock or with respect to the Company Ltd. Common Units
and (b) the right of any dissenter properly exercising rights under the NMA shall be for payment, pursuant to the NMA, solely of the fair value of the

Agreement so that such Company Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and (C) after the expiration of the Notice Period,
the Company Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any changes in the financial terms or any other material amendment to the terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal will require a
new Company Notice and a new two (2) Business Day Notice Period (it being understood that any such two (2) Business Day period will be calculated in
the same manner as the initial four (4) Business Day period, will end at 5:00 pm Eastern time at the end of such two (2) Business Day period and no such
new Company Notice shall reduce the initial four (4) Business Day period)).
(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company, the Special Committee, or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by

Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) from making any “stop, look and listen”
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that
the issuance by the Company, the Special Committee or the Company Board of a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change);
provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Company Board or the Special Committee shall be permitted to recommend that the stockholders of
the Company tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is a Company Takeover Proposal or otherwise effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect thereto, except as permitted by Section 5.3(e) and (f).
(h) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit (A) the Company, the Company Board or the Special Committee, directly or indirectly through any
Representative, from informing any Person of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3, or (B) the Company and its Representatives from contacting
any Persons or group of Persons that have made a Company Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to request clarification of the
terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Company Takeover Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Company
Superior Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 5.3.
Section 5.4 Filings; Other Actions.
(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and
shall cause such Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC. Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning Parent, Parent Merger Sub, and
their respective Affiliates as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise reasonably assist
and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments thereto received from the SEC. The
parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and file
such other documents with the SEC as may be reasonably requested by the SEC in connection with the Proxy Statement. Each party shall notify the other
party promptly of the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of
party promptly of the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply the other party with copies of all
correspondence between such party and any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect
to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof) any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by
Parent or the Company, as applicable, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would
not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by the parties with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company’s stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the earlier of (i) the resolution of any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary
Proxy Statement or (ii) receiving notification that the SEC is not reviewing the preliminary Proxy Statement (such date, the “Clearance Date”). Prior to the
filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding
to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments
on such document or response, which the Company shall consider in good faith. Subject to Section 8.2, the Company shall bear all filing fees required to
be paid to the SEC with respect to, and all printing and dissemination costs for, the Proxy Statement.
A-42

(b) Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change but subject to Section 5.4(c), the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Law, the rules and policies of NYSE and the Company Organizational Documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval as soon as reasonably practicable following the Clearance Date. Unless the Company shall have made a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.2, the Company shall include the Company Recommendation and the Special Committee
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall solicit the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting.
(c) Subject to Section 5.3, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval (which shall include hiring a
proxy solicitor). The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting
results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders and shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any communications
(whether written or oral) with any stockholder of the Company indicating that such stockholder may vote against the Merger and shall supply Parent with
copies of all such communications if in written form. The Company may, after consultation with Parent, adjourn, recess or postpone the Company
Stockholders’ Meeting (i) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and dissemination of any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement
that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and disseminated under
applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time that the Company Stockholders’ Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of
the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and (iii) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval if the Company
reasonably determines in good faith that the Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained; provided, that without the written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), in no event shall the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (as so postponed or adjourned)
be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the Company Stockholders’ Meeting was originally scheduled. In no event will the
record date of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting be changed without Parent’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless required by applicable Law.
Section 5.5 Employee Matters.
(a) With respect to each individual who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
“Company Employee”), for a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, or such shorter period such Company Employee continues
employment with Parent, or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) (and in the case of clause (iv), for the applicable period following
termination of such Company Employee’s employment), Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to provide each
such Company Employee, (i) base salary or wages at a rate that is no less favorable than the rate of base salary or wages provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than the annual cash bonus opportunity
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) an annual long-term incentive opportunity that is substantially similar to
the annual long-term incentive award opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided, that, any long-
term incentive compensation opportunity, or portion thereof, may be provided in the form of cash rather than equity, as determined in Parent’s sole
discretion, (iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits set forth on Section 5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and (v) employee benefits (excluding equity incentives) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the Company Benefit Plans listed in Section
3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
(b) Each Company Employee who is a participant in an annual cash bonus or other short-term incentive program maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for the year in which the Closing occurs shall be eligible to receive a cash bonus under the Company’s bonus programs for such year in
which the Closing occurs
A-43
Table of Contents
as follows: (i) for the performance period that has elapsed as of the Closing Date, the bonus for such period shall be no less than the amount determined
based on actual achievement of pro-rated performance goals under such bonus programs through the Closing Date, as determined immediately prior to
the Closing by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board in its reasonable discretion, pro-rated based on the number of days in the applicable
performance period that have elapsed as of the Closing (each, a “Pro-Rated 2022 Bonus”); and (ii) for the remaining performance period that follows the
Closing Date for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, the bonus shall be based on actual achievement of pro-rated performance goals determined
under the bonus programs maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, as determined by Parent in its discretion, pro-rated
based on the number of days in the applicable performance period that have elapsed following the Closing Date (collectively, the “2022 Bonus”). Subject
to each such Company Employee remaining employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, on the payment date, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to pay the aggregate amount of the 2022 Bonuses to the applicable Company
Employees at the same time that such annual bonuses are typically paid in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that any Company Employee dies, or is terminated by the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries without cause or due to disability, in each case, prior to
the payment date of the annual bonuses for the year in which the Closing occurs, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, pay to such Company
Employee (or his or her estate) the Pro-Rated 2022 Bonus within 60 days following such employment termination date. For purposes of this Section 5.5(b),
“cause” shall have such meaning as is contained in such Company Employee’s employment or severance agreement with the Company as in effect as of
the date hereof, or, if there is no such agreement, shall have such meaning as is set forth on Section 5.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company,
following the Closing and in which any of the Company Employees participate, including any paid time off and severance plans, service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the predecessor of any of them shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Company, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable) and entitlement to (or level of) benefits (but not for
accrual of or entitlement to pension benefits or post-employment welfare benefits, or to the extent that treatment would result in a duplication of benefits
for the same period of service).
(d) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to use reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations otherwise applicable to such Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent that
provides health benefits in which such Company Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in
effect with respect to such Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents immediately prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by such Company Employee and his or her eligible
dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to transitioning into a plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent during the
portion of the calendar year prior to such transition in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such
Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible
dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.
(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.13, no provision of this Section 5.5, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person (including, without limitation, any Company Employee and any dependent or beneficiary
thereof) other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, (ii) shall constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any
Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, (iii) shall give any Person
(including, without limitation, any
A-44
Table of Contents
Company Employee) any right to continued employment or service with the Company, Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, or (iv) is intended to
prevent the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms.
Section 5.6 Regulatory Approvals; Efforts.
(a) Parent, Parent Merger Sub, Company Ltd., Company Merger Sub, and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to,

“second request” for additional information and documentary material under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable). Further, Parent shall, and shall
cause its controlled Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment, including any
Order, that may be asserted by a Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with granting
any Required Regulatory Consent so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as possible (and in any event prior to the End Date). Further, Parent
shall cause its Affiliates to, as required, assist in the preparation and filing of any required filings. Parent shall pay all filing fees associated with all filings,
forms, notices, registrations and notifications under the HSR Act and other antitrust, competition, merger control and foreign investment Laws.

C.F.R. § 803.12, any filing made under the HSR Act once, but otherwise shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (i) extend or restart
the waiting, review or investigation period under any applicable antitrust, competition, merger control or foreign investment Law or (ii) offer, negotiate or

Surviving Company or Surviving Corporation Ltd. From and after the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Company and Surviving Company Ltd. shall
advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters

thereof after the Effective Time; and (B) the Surviving Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one legal counsel retained by the Covered
Persons, promptly after statements therefor are received. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.9(a) or elsewhere in this

liability in connection with such Proceeding and includes an unconditional release of all Covered Persons from all liability arising out of such Proceeding.
(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent otherwise expressly prohibited by applicable Law, the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company and the operating agreement of Surviving Company Ltd. shall contain provisions no less favorable

the Effective Time become) directors or officers of the Company or Company Ltd. covered by any of the Company’s or Company Ltd.’s directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policies with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to Parent and providing benefits that are substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable than the existing policies of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage, and the Surviving Company
and Surviving Company Ltd. shall maintain such directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary insurance policies in full force and effect for each
of their full six (6) year terms and continue to honor their respective obligations under each policy; provided, that in no event shall the aggregate
premiums payable for such “tail” policies for their entire period exceed an amount equal to 300% of the aggregate current annual premiums paid by the
Company and Company Ltd. for such insurance (the “Maximum Amount”); provided, further, that if the amount of the aggregate premiums necessary to
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Company and Company Ltd. shall be entitled to procure for such six-year period the
most advantageous policies as can be reasonably obtained for the Maximum Amount. If the Company and Company Ltd. for any reason does not obtain
such prepaid “tail” insurance as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and Surviving Company Ltd. shall continue to maintain in effect, for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for the current and former directors and officers of the Company and Company Ltd., the existing
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary insurance for the Company and Company Ltd.
(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or Surviving Company Ltd. or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity
or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.
(e) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, and shall not limit in any way any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such individual may have under applicable Law, the Company Organizational Documents, the Company Ltd. Organizational Documents, by contract
or otherwise. From and after the Effective Time, the obligations under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in any manner that adversely
affects the rights of the Covered Persons to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y)
the affected Covered Person has consented in writing to such termination or modification, it being expressly agreed that the Covered Persons (including
their respective heirs and representatives) shall be express third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9. In the event of any breach by Parent, the Surviving
Company or Surviving Company Ltd. of this Section 5.9, Parent, the Surviving Company and Surviving Company Ltd. shall pay all reasonable expenses,
including attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9 as such

Section 5.11 Financing and Financing Cooperation.
(a) Parent and Parent Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date on
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the Equity Investor to maintain in full
force and effect the Equity Commitment Letter and maintain in full force and effect the Debt Commitment Letter; (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
debt financing agreements on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise on terms and conditions no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Parent Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as the terms and conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (the “Definitive Debt Financing Agreements”); (iii) satisfy on a timely basis, and in a manner that will not impede the ability
of the parties to consummate the Merger upon the date which the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof, in each case, to
the extent in the control of Parent or Parent Merger Sub, all conditions to the funding of the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters and the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and complying with their respective obligations thereunder and (iv) if the conditions to the Financing have been
satisfied in Parent’s reasonable good faith judgment, consummating the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Parent and Parent Merger Sub shall comply
with their obligations, and enforce their rights, under the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements in a timely and diligent
manner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that all conditions contained in any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Debt
Financing Agreement (other than the consummation of the Mergers) have been satisfied, Parent and Parent Merger Sub shall cause the Lenders and the
Equity Investor thereunder to comply with their respective obligations thereunder, including to fund the Financing. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonable current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letters. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any actual breach or default, repudiation, termination or cancellation by any party of its
obligations under the Commitment Letters, (ii) any written notice or other written communication from any Lender, the Equity Investor or other financing
source with respect to any actual or threatened breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination, by any party to the Commitment Letters or any
Definitive Debt Financing Agreement or (iii) any fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have (or with the lapse of time or notice
or both), individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters and/or Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements including that Parent will not reasonably be able to obtain all or a portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, in each case, of which Parent or Parent Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination of the obligations under
the Commitment Letters.
(b) Neither Parent or Parent Merger Sub shall, without the prior written consent of the Company: (A) permit any amendment or modification to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements if such amendment, modification, waiver
or remedy, would
A-50
Table of Contents
or would reasonably be expected to (i) materially and adversely affect or delay in any respect Parent’s or Parent Merger Sub’s ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the ability of Parent or Parent Merger Sub to enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments or (ii)
add new (or modify existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Financing or reduce the amount of the Financing, in each case,
without the consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, that Parent and Parent Merger Sub may replace or amend
the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or otherwise so long as the terms would not adversely impact the ability of Parent or Parent Merger Sub to timely
consummate the Merger or the likelihood of consummation of the Merger or the ability of Parent or Parent Merger Sub to enforce its rights under the
Financing Commitments. Upon any such amendment, modification or waiver, the term “Debt Commitment Letter” and “Definitive Debt Financing
Agreement” shall mean the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreement, as applicable, as so amended or modified. Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement, other modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter.
(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, or the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall be
withdrawn, repudiated, reduced by a material amount or by an amount such that Parent and Parent Merger Sub would not have funds in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, terminated or rescinded for any reason, then Parent shall (i) promptly notify
the Company in writing of such unavailability, withdrawal, repudiation, reduction in amount, termination or rescission and the reason therefor and (ii) use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, from the same and/or alternative
financing sources, alternative financing (A) in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay the Merger
Amounts and (B) which does not include any terms or conditions to the consummation of such alternative financing that would or would reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect or delay in any material respect Parent or Parent Merger Sub’s ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event any alternative financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 5.11(a) (“Alternative Financing”),
references in this Agreement to the Financing shall also be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and if one or more commitment letters or
definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this
Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall also be deemed to refer to such commitment letters, as
applicable, and the definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and all obligations of Parent pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall
be applicable thereto to the same extent as Parent’s obligations with respect to the Debt Financing.
(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to
provide such cooperation as is reasonably requested by Parent and at Parent’s sole cost and expense, in connection with the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) furnish to Parent and its financing sources such financial,
statistical and other pertinent information (but not projections or other forward-looking information) relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably requested by Parent solely to the extent such information is within the Company’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ control and (1)(x) reasonably
available thereto, (y) prepared by or for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business or (2) in the form and substance of (or
not more burdensome to prepare than) the financial information (including property-level financing information) delivered to Parent and Parent Merger
Sub prior to the date hereof, (ii) make appropriate officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries available at reasonable times and locations agreed by the
Company for a reasonable number of due diligence meetings and for participation in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows and

agency presentations, bank information memoranda, and similar documents necessary, proper or advisable in connection with any syndication of the
Debt Financing, (iv) [reserved], (v) provide and execute documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with such Debt Financing,
including all documentation and other

information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable beneficial ownership regulations, “know-your-customer” and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations (the “KYC Certifications”) and other definitive financing documents, or other certificates, or documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing, and facilitating the obtaining of guarantees and pledging collateral in connection with the
Debt Financing, in each case to be effective as of no earlier than the Closing, (vi) as may be reasonably requested by Parent, following the obtainment of
the Company Stockholder Approval, form new direct or indirect Subsidiaries of the Company pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Company, (vii) as may be reasonably requested by Parent, following the obtainment of the Company Stockholder Approval and provided
such actions would not adversely affect the Tax status of the Company or its Subsidiaries or cause the Company to be subject to additional Taxes that are
not indemnified by Parent under the second to last sentence of this Section 5.11(d), transfer or otherwise restructure its ownership of existing
Subsidiaries, properties or other assets, in each case, pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, (viii) provide
reasonable assistance with respect to the review and delivery of guarantees and granting of mortgages, pledges and security interests in collateral for the

cooperate in connection with the repayment or defeasance of any existing indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurred after the date
hereof and in existence as of the Effective Time and the release of related Liens, including delivering such payoff, defeasance or similar notices under any
existing loans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by Parent, and (xi) to the extent reasonably requested by a financing
source, permit Parent and its Representatives to conduct appraisal and environmental and engineering inspections of each real estate property owned
and, subject to obtaining required third party consents with respect thereto (which the Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain), leased by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (provided, however, that (A) neither Parent nor its Representative shall have the right, without the Company’s prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to take and analyze any samples of any environmental media (including soil,
groundwater, surface water, air or sediment) or any building material or to perform any invasive testing procedure on any such property, provided, that
Company shall not unreasonably withhold its consent if such testing or analysis is reasonably required by Lenders in connection with the findings of
any Phase I environmental site assessment conducted in connection with the Financing, (B) Parent shall schedule, coordinate and conduct all
inspections with the Company in accordance with Section 5.2(a), and (C) the Company shall be entitled to have representatives present at all times during
any such inspection). No obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents

taking of any action that would conflict with or violate the Company Organizational Documents or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the

without lapse of time, or both) under, any applicable Law or Material Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) provide access to or disclose
information that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or could result in the disclosure of any trade secrets, customer-specific data or competitively sensitive information not otherwise required to
be provided under this Agreement or the violation of any confidentiality obligation (provided, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure in a manner than does not violate this clause (iv)), (v) prepare any financial statements or information (including
property-level financial information) that are not available to and prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice or prepare any pro

amend, the Debt Financing or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements or any agreement, document or instrument of any kind that will be effective prior

with respect to the Debt Financing. None of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to
apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the actions taken by the Company at the request of Parent pursuant to this Section 5.11(d). Parent
shall (A) reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.11 (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), (B) indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective Representatives) from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses actually
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any actions taken by them pursuant to Section 5.11(d) and (C) reimburse and/or indemnify the
Company for costs, losses, damages, claims, expenses and taxes suffered or incurred in connection with actions taken pursuant to clauses (d)(vi) and (vii)
and any information used in connection with any of the foregoing (other than information provided to Parent in writing by the Company or its
Subsidiaries specifically in connection with their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.11(d)), except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective Representatives). The Company hereby consents to the
reasonable use of its logos in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company and its Subsidiaries or their reputation or goodwill.
(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in Section 5.11(d), represent the sole obligation of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any
financing (including the Financing) to be obtained by Parent or Parent Merger Sub with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters) by or to Parent, Parent Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing
transaction be a condition to any of Parent’s or Parent Merger Sub’s obligations hereunder.
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, the Company’s breach of, or non-performance of, any of the covenants required to be
performed by it under this Section 5.11 shall not be a condition of Parent or Parent Merger Sub to Closing and shall not be considered in determining the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b), unless (i) such breach is a willful and material breach, (ii) such breach is the primary cause of
Parent being unable to obtain the proceeds of the Financing at Closing and (iii) unless and until (x) Parent provides written notice (the “Non-Cooperation
Notice”) to the Company of any alleged failure to comply, or action or failure to act which could be believed to be a breach of Section 5.11(d) or Section
5.17, (y) Parent includes in such Non-Cooperation Notice reasonable detail regarding the cooperation required to cure such alleged failure (which shall
not require the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives to provide any cooperation that it would not otherwise be required to
provide under Section 5.11(d) or Section 5.17), and (z) the Company and its Subsidiaries fail to take the actions specified on such Non-Cooperation Notice
within five (5) Business Days from receipt of such Non-Cooperation Notice.

Litigation. The Company shall not cease to defend, consent to the entry of any judgment, settle or offer to settle or take any other material action with
respect to such Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Parent), including the issuance of a notice of redemption and all other customary certificates, opinions and other documentation (collectively, the
“Redemption Documents”), as may be required under the terms of the applicable series of Senior Notes to effect such redemption or prepayment effective

Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is due and payable, for any Liabilities, including the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone, while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the

Parties, that the maximum aggregate monetary liability of the Parent Related Parties, if any, shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the Parent Termination

Section 8.5 Specific Enforcement.
(a) The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, prior to
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII and subject in all respects to Sections 7.2, 7.3 and this 8.5, (i) the parties shall be entitled

requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief and (iii) the parties
will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law. In circumstances where Parent and Parent Merger Sub are
obligated to consummate the Mergers and the Mergers have not been consummated, Parent and Parent Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree
that the Company, Company Merger Sub, Company Ltd. and the Company’s stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages
will be inadequate to compensate the Company, Company Merger Sub, Company Ltd. and the Company’s stockholders, and that the Company on behalf
of itself and its stockholders, Company Merger Sub, and Company Ltd. shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available whether in
law or equity, including monetary damages) to enforce specifically Parent’s and Parent Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Mergers. The
Company’s, Company Merger Sub’s or Company Ltd.’s pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of
the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which the Company, Company Merger Sub, or Company Ltd. may be entitled, including the right to
pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the Company, Company Merger Sub, Company Ltd. and the Company’s stockholders.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.5(a) or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company, Company Merger Sub, and Company Ltd. shall not
be entitled to seek to enforce specifically Parent’s and Parent Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and, if so desired, to cause the Equity Financing to be funded unless (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by a breach by Parent or Parent Merger
Sub of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) shall have been satisfied (or be capable of being satisfied
at the Closing) or (to the extent permissible under applicable Law) waived, (ii) the full amount of the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) has been
funded or would be funded at the Closing if the equity financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters (the “Equity Financing”) were funded

verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best

furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our
analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any
term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This

in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares
pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time, as to the potential
effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the
solvency or viability of the Company, Company Ltd. or Parent, or the ability of the Company, Company Ltd. or Parent to pay their respective obligations

they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or
events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the
