AMERICAN CAMPUS COMMUNITIES INC_20220616_DEFM14A_20169998_4477606.Pdf,The Special Meeting,"The Special Meeting (page 29)
The Proposals
The virtual special meeting of our stockholders will be held on August 4, 2022 at 10:00 a.m., Central Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access
the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit register.proxypush.com/acc. At the virtual special meeting, holders of our common stock, $0.01
par value per share, which we refer to as “common stock,” as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, will be asked to
consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, which proposal we refer to as the
“merger proposal,” (2) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers, which proposal we refer to as the “advisory compensation proposal,” and (3)
a proposal to approve any adjournment of the virtual special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes
at the virtual special meeting to approve the merger proposal, which proposal we refer to as the “adjournment proposal.” If the merger is approved
by our stockholders and completed as contemplated by the merger agreement, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the merger effective time will be converted into the right to receive $65.47 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of
and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock
is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the
record date. On the record date, our outstanding voting securities consisted of 139,483,032 shares of common stock and 1,171,141 unvested
restricted stock awards entitled to be voted by employees.
The presence in person or by proxy of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the virtual special meeting will
constitute a quorum for purposes of the virtual special meeting. Virtual attendance at the virtual special meeting constitutes presence in person for
quorum purposes at the virtual special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the virtual special meeting. Abstentions will be
counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
Required Vote
Completion of the mergers requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast the
majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each
matter to be voted on. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our stockholders are entitled to cast rather than
on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail
to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting against the merger proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the approval of the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the mergers. For the purpose of each of these
proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will
have no effect on the outcome of these proposals.
3Table of Contents
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 1,218,039 shares of our
common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.9% of the total combined voting power of our common stock at the virtual special meeting.
Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of
the advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.
Proxies; Revocation
Any of our stockholders of record entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of common stock by returning the enclosed
proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by attending the virtual special meeting and voting
during the live webcast. If the shares of common stock that you own are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you should
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your broker or you may attend the
virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast.
Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by your delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy card, by authorizing your proxy
by telephone or through the Internet at a later date than your previously authorized proxy, by your filing a written revocation of your proxy with our
Secretary or by your voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting alone will not be sufficient to revoke a
previously authorized proxy.
If you own common stock in “street name,” you may revoke or change previously granted voting instructions by following the instructions
provided by the broker, bank or other nominee that is the registered owner of the shares or by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting.

In connection with the mergers, BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”), the Company’s financial advisor, delivered to our board of directors an oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion, dated April 18, 2022, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the
opinion, of the common stock consideration to be received by holders of our common stock. The full text of the written opinion, dated April 18,
2022, of BofA Securities, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on
the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BofA Securities
provided its opinion to our board of directors (in its capacity as our board of directors) for the benefit and use of our board of directors in
connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the common stock consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Securities’ opinion does
not address any other aspect of the mergers and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the mergers in comparison to other
strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the underlying business
decision of the Company to proceed with or effect the mergers. BofA Securities’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder
as to how to vote or act in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any other matter.
The Company has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee that is currently estimated to be
$56.3 million, approximately $3 million of which was payable upon the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion and the remaining portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the merger. The Company also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in
connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.
Pursuant to its engagement letter with the Company, BofA Securities would be entitled to a transaction fee from the Company in connection with
any merger or similar acquisition transaction, irrespective of the identity of the acquirer. Such fee would generally be higher for a transaction that
provides for greater merger consideration.

Common Stock
The merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of common stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than shares of common stock held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, including
common stock held in the Company’s rabbi trust for the purposes of meeting Company liabilities under its deferred compensation plan, or by the
Parent Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded common stock”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to $65.47 per share, without interest (such per share amount, the “common stock consideration”) and less
any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded common stock will be automatically retired and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with
respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the merger.
If we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid or reduce the incurrence of
income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the common stock consideration will be decreased by
an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock.
Restricted Stock
The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of unvested restricted stock (which we
refer to as a “restricted stock”) granted pursuant to the Company’s 2018 Incentive Award Plan (which we refer to collectively with the Company’s
2004 Incentive Award Plan and the 2010 Incentive Award Plan as the “incentive award plans”), other than each outstanding equity-based award
credited to a stock account under the Company’s deferred compensation plan and each outstanding unvested equity-based award with respect to
which a valid deferral election under the deferred compensation plan has been made (which we refer to as “deferred stock awards”), will
automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of common stock
represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive the common stock
consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Deferred Stock Awards
The merger agreement provides that all deferred stock awards will, as of immediately before the merger effective time, become vested and no longer
subject to restriction, and all deferred stock awards will, at the merger effective time, be adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to have
allocated to the holder’s account under the deferred compensation plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of
shares of common stock allocated to such account as of the merger effective time and (2) the merger consideration, and will no longer represent a
right to receive a number of shares of common stock.

The merger agreement provides that, at the partnership merger effective time, each limited partnership unit, or fraction thereof, issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than common partnership units held by the Company or any
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or by Parent, Merger Sub II or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded
common partnership units”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock
consideration, without interest (such per unit amount, the “partnership unit consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Limited
partnership units and general partnership interests in the Partnership, in each case, held by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company will be unaffected by the partnership merger and will remain outstanding as partnership units of the Surviving
6Table of Contents
Partnership held by the Company or the relevant wholly owned subsidiary. Limited partnership units held by Parent, Merger Sub II or any of their
respective wholly owned subsidiaries will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in
connection with, or as a consequence of, the partnership merger.
As discussed above, if we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, or to avoid or
reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the partnership unit
consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock.
This proxy statement does not constitute any solicitation of consents in respect of the partnership merger, and does not constitute an offer to
exchange the limited partnership units.

AMERICAN CAMPUS COMMUNITIES INC_20220616_DEFM14A_20169998_4477606.Pdf,Financing,"Financing (page 56)
In connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $9.2 billion to be paid to the holders of our common
stock, restricted stock, deferred stock awards and limited partnership units. Prior to the closing of the mergers, we expect to repay at maturity our
$200 million term loan. Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent expects to cause our outstanding
indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, if any, to be repaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans and senior
unsecured notes to be repaid or remain outstanding. As of March 31, 2022, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility,
$200 million in term loan financing outstanding, approximately $535.4 million in mortgage loans and project-based taxable bonds outstanding
(including a $330 million mortgage loan made to wholly owned subsidiaries of a joint venture in which we own a 55% interest) and $2.8 billion in
senior unsecured notes outstanding.
Parent has informed us that it has received, in connection with the mergers, a debt commitment letter from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., providing for debt
financing through two balance sheet loans in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $2.1 billion and that it currently intends to pursue
additional debt financing in connection with the mergers. In addition, it is expected that BREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (the “Sponsor”), which is the operating partnership of BREIT, and its affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding
the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt financing.
Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing may
be used for purposes such as reserves, paying carrying costs with respect to the properties, funding working capital requirements, and for other
costs and expenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under
the debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or ground leased by
us, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable
collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings.
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the mergers. For more information, see

the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals,” we and our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on our
ability to solicit any competing proposal or inquiry, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
encourage, provide any non-public information or take any other action for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or
inquiry, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person information in
connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry, or enter into an alternative acquisition
agreement (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals”), or resolve, propose or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, we may participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
and furnish information (including non-public information) to, any person that has made, renewed or delivered to us a bona fide written competing
proposal after the date of the merger agreement and prior to obtaining the stockholder approval (that did not result from a breach of our obligations
described in the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals” and “The Merger Agreement—Obligation of
Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation”), if our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such competing proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
superior proposal (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals”).
Under certain circumstances and after following certain procedures and adhering to certain restrictions, we are permitted to terminate the merger
agreement if our board of directors approves, and substantially concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement, we enter into an

party to perform in all material respects any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under the merger agreement.

Company Termination Payment
We have agreed to pay Parent the termination payment of $278 million (the “company termination payment”), if:
•
Parent terminates the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in the second bullet in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by Parent”;
•
we terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in the second bullet in the section entitled “The Merger

•
(1) a competing proposal has been received by us or our representatives or any person has publicly proposed or made (or

competing proposal (and, in the case of a termination pursuant to the provision described in the third bullet in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by Either the Company or Parent,” such
competing proposal or publicly proposed or announced intention was made prior to the special meeting) and (2) within 12
months following such termination referred to in the immediately preceding sub-bullet, we enter into a definitive written
agreement providing for the implementation of any competing proposal or any competing proposal is consummated (provided,
that for purposes of this sub-bullet, each reference to 15% in the definition of “competing proposal” will be increased to 50%).
However, the company termination payment will equal $139 million if the merger agreement was terminated by us pursuant to the provision described
in the second bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by the Company” prior to
11:59 p.m., New York time, on May 28, 2022 in order to enter into a definitive agreement with an excluded party (as described in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Termination Payments—Company Termination Payment”) providing for the implementation of a superior proposal so
long as such person or group is an excluded party.
Parent Termination Payment
Parent has agreed to pay to us a termination payment of $832 million (the “parent termination payment”) if we terminate the merger agreement
pursuant to the provisions described in the first bullet or third bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger

In connection with the merger agreement, the Sponsor entered into a limited guarantee in our favor to guarantee Parent’s payment obligations with
respect to the parent termination payment and certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under the merger agreement,
subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the limited guarantee.
The maximum aggregate liability of the Sponsor under the limited guarantee will not exceed $832 million, plus the costs and expenses (including
reasonable fees of counsel) actually incurred by us relating to any litigation or other proceeding brought by us to enforce our rights under the
limited guarantee if we prevail in such litigation or proceeding, together with interest at the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal.
We and the Partnership cannot seek specific performance to require the Parent Parties to consummate the mergers and, except with respect to
enforcing confidentiality provisions, our sole and exclusive remedy against the Parent Parties relating to any breach of the merger agreement or
otherwise will be the right to receive the parent termination payment and certain expense reimbursements and other costs under the conditions
described in the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Payments—Parent Termination Payment” and “The Merger Agreement—
Limited Guarantee and Remedies.” The Parent Parties may, however, seek specific performance to require us and the Partnership to consummate the
mergers.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement, plaintiffs filed three separate lawsuits related to the proxy statement. One suit, styled Cody
Charfauros v. American Campus Communities, et al., No. 1:22-cv-04075, which we refer to as the “Charfauros Lawsuit” was filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York. A second suit, styled as Shiva Stein v. American Campus Communities, Inc., et al., No.
1:22-cv-03829-JGK, which we refer to as the “Stein Lawsuit,” was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
A third suit, styled as Samuel Acuna v. American Campus Communities, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-03254, which we refer to as the “Acuna Lawsuit,” was
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
The Charfauros Lawsuit names as defendants the Company, the Company’s directors and a former director of the Company who ceased to serve as
such in 2015 upon his death. The Charfauros Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including the
rights, authorities and powers of the special committee, the confidentiality agreements with Blackstone and other counterparties, potential conflicts
of interest involving certain directors and officers of the Company, the value of Company options, restricted stock units, and other equity awards
that the Company’s directors and officers will receive in the proposed mergers, details regarding any discussions about the future employment of
the Company’s officers and directors, certain financial projections and metrics, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of
non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, and input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities’ analysis. Relying on those allegations, the
Charfauros Lawsuit asserts, on behalf of an individual plaintiff, a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and
a “control person” claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violations against the members of our board of
directors. The Charfauros Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers, rescission of the mergers if the mergers
are consummated, the dissemination of a revised preliminary proxy statement, an award of damages if the mergers are consummated and an award of
plaintiff’s costs, including attorneys’ fees.
The Stein Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company’s directors. Like the Charfauros Lawsuit, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a
claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of
our board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial
projections, financial metrics, input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities’ analysis, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to
GAAP metrics. The Stein Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers unless and until defendants disclose the
material information alleged to have been omitted from the proxy statement, rescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are
consummated, an award of damages and an award of plaintiff’s costs, including attorneys’ fees.
The Acuna Lawsuit, like the Charfauros Lawsuit and the Stein Lawsuit, names as defendants the Company and the Company’s directors and asserts
a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of
our board of directors. The Acuna Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial
projections (including line items underlying the projections, net income projections and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP
metrics), input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities’ analysis, potential conflicts of interest involving KeyBank Capital Markets Inc. and
potential conflicts of interest
13Table of Contents
involving certain directors and officers of the Company. The Acuna Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers,
rescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are consummated, a declaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and an award of plaintiff’s costs, including attorneys’ fees.
The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the mergers from becoming effective in a timely manner.
Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit and
intends to defend against these actions vigorously.

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation
of the Company and will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined below) of shares of
common stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the
amount of cash received with respect to such U.S. holder’s shares of common stock in the merger, and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its
shares. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder (as defined below) of the merger will depend on various factors, including
whether the receipt of such payments is treated as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain from the sale of “United States real
property interests” (“USRPIs”) pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). See “The
Mergers—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock” for
further discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to non-U.S. holders. You should consult your tax advisors
regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any
state, local or foreign income and other tax laws). For further discussion, see “The Mergers—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”",21,21

AMERICAN CAMPUS COMMUNITIES INC_20220616_DEFM14A_20169998_4477606.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGERS
The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the virtual special meeting and the proposed mergers.
These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by reference,
including the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
A:
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Partnership, by affiliates of Blackstone pursuant to
the merger agreement. After the merger proposal has been approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger
agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub II will be merged with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the
Surviving Partnership. Immediately following the partnership merger effective time the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub I, with
Merger Sub I continuing as the Surviving Company. The mergers will occur at the times provided in the merger agreement. For additional
information about the mergers, please review the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document governing the
mergers.
Q:
As a stockholder, what will I receive in the merger?
A:
For each outstanding share of common stock that you own immediately prior to the merger effective time, you will receive $65.47 in cash, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
Will I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the common stock that I own?
A:
Under the terms of the merger agreement, we may not authorize, declare or pay any dividends to the holders of shares of our common stock without
the prior written consent of Parent, other than dividends determined in good faith to be required to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or
to avoid or reduce the payment of income or excise tax (with any such additional required dividend resulting in a corresponding decrease to the
common stock consideration).
Q:
What will happen to my restricted stock?
A:
Immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of restricted stock granted pursuant to an incentive award plan, other than
deferred stock awards, will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares
of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive
the common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
What will happen to my deferred stock awards?
A:
All deferred stock awards will, as of immediately before the merger effective time, become vested and no longer subject to restriction, and all
deferred stock awards will, at the merger effective time, be adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to have allocated to the holder’s
account under the deferred compensation plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of common stock
allocated to such account as of the merger effective time and (2) the merger consideration, and will no longer represent a right to receive a number
of shares of common stock.
15Table of Contents
Q:
What will happen to the incentive award plans in the mergers?
A:
At the merger effective time, the incentive award plans will terminate.
Q:
When do you expect the mergers to be completed?
A:
If our stockholders vote to approve the merger proposal, and assuming that the other conditions to the mergers are satisfied or waived, it is
anticipated that the mergers will be completed in the third quarter of 2022. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the mergers will take
place on the third business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the mergers described under “The Merger Agreement—Conditions
to the Mergers” (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the closing of the mergers, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing) or at such other date as mutually agreed by Parent and us. For further information
regarding the timing of the closing of the mergers, see “The Merger Agreement—Effective Times; Closing Date.”
Q:
What happens if the mergers are not completed?
A:
If the merger proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the mergers are not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not
receive any payment for their common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, American Campus Communities, Inc. will remain a public
company, our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and to be listed on the NYSE, and our common stock, restricted
stock and partnership units will remain outstanding. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, we will be required
to pay Parent the company termination payment. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay us the parent termination payment
upon termination of the merger agreement.
Q:
If the mergers are completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my common stock?
A:
Following the completion of the merger, your shares of common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the
aggregate common stock consideration. Shortly after the mergers are completed, you will receive an instruction letter describing how you may
exchange your shares of common stock for the common stock consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” by your
broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to
effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the common stock consideration.
Q:
When and where is the virtual special meeting?
A:
The virtual special meeting will be held on August 4, 2022 at 10:00 a.m., Central Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special
meeting, stockholders should visit register.proxypush.com/acc.
Q:
Who can vote and attend the virtual special meeting?
A:
All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of
and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock
is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the
record date.
Q:
How do I attend the virtual special meeting?
A:
The virtual special meeting will be held in a virtual-only format on August 4, 2022 at 10:00 a.m., Central Time. You will not be able to physically
attend the virtual special meeting. To access the virtual meeting,
16
Table of Contents
stockholders should visit register.proxypush.com/acc. The virtual special meeting will start promptly at 10:00 a.m., Central Time. You will need the
latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Edge or Firefox. Please ensure your browser is compatible. As a stockholder, you will then be
required to enter your control number from your proxy card or broker’s notice. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email.
Approximately one hour prior to the start of the meeting an email will be sent to the email address you provided during registration with a unique
link to the virtual meeting. Please contact Investor Relations at (512) 732-1000 if you have any other questions in connection with attending the
virtual special meeting.
Q:
What vote of stockholders is required to approve the merger proposal?
A:
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes
entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our
stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to
your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Q:
What vote of stockholders is required to approve the advisory compensation proposal?
A:
Approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of
this proposal, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will
have no effect on the proposal.
Q:
What vote of stockholders is required to approve the adjournment proposal?
A:
Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this
proposal, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have
no effect on the proposal.
Q:
Why is my vote important?
A:
If you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote at the virtual special meeting, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary
quorum to hold the virtual special meeting. In addition, because the merger proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of our
common stock entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting, your failure to authorize
your proxy or voting instructions or to vote at the virtual special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of the
merger proposal.
Q:
How does the common stock consideration compare to the market price of the Company’s common stock?
A:
The merger consideration of $65.47 per share represents a premium of approximately 22% to the 90-calendar day volume-weighted average share
price ending April 18, 2022, a premium of approximately 30% over the closing stock price of February 16, 2022, the date immediately prior to our
disclosing receipt of an indication of willingness to offer to acquire us, and a premium of approximately 14% over closing price of our common stock
on April 18, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger agreement.
Q:
How does our board of directors recommend that I vote?
A:
Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal, and “FOR” the
adjournment proposal.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the advisory compensation proposal?
A:
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the “SEC,” has adopted rules that require companies to seek a nonbinding,
advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or
17
Table of Contents
become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the merger.
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory compensation proposal?
A:
The vote to approve the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Approval of
this proposal is not a condition to completion of the mergers. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our
board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the mergers are completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive
the compensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.
Q:
Do any of the Company’s directors and executive officers have any interest in the mergers that is different than mine?
A:
Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those interests of our
stockholders generally. See “The Mergers — Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” for information about interests that
our directors and executive officers have in the mergers that are different than yours.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the annexes attached to this proxy statement, please
vote your shares or authorize a proxy to vote your shares in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. Holders of our common stock
will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned as of the record date.
Q:
How do I cast my vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote at the virtual special meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares at the
virtual special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope.
Q:
How do I cast my vote if my common stock is held of record in “street name”?
A:
If you own common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with
the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, since brokers, banks and other nominees
do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement. If you have not received such
voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you
directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also vote at the virtual special
meeting.
Q:
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?
A:
With respect to the merger proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your
shares in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the merger proposal. With respect to the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast
your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker,
bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals.

Q:
How will proxy holders vote my common stock?
A:
If you properly authorize a proxy prior to the virtual special meeting, your shares will be voted as you direct. If you authorize a proxy but no
direction is otherwise made, your shares will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the
adjournment proposal. Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual
special meeting.
Q:
What happens if I sell my common stock before the virtual special meeting?
A:
If you held shares of common stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective time, you will retain your right to vote at the
virtual special meeting, but not the right to receive the common stock consideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when
the merger becomes effective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares you previously owned.
Q:
Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it is
exercised by filing with our Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending and voting at the virtual
special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you have
instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the foregoing options for changing your vote do not apply and instead you must
follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote or you may attend and vote at the virtual special
meeting.
Q:
Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?
A:
Yes. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete
liquidation of the Company and will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of shares of
common stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the
amount of cash received with respect to such U.S. holder’s shares of common stock in the merger, and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its
shares. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of the merger will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt
of such payments is treated as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs pursuant to the provisions of
FIRPTA. See “The Mergers—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of
Common Stock” for further discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to non-U.S. holders. You should consult
your tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application
and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws). For further discussion, see “The Mergers—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences.”
Q:
What rights do I have if I oppose the merger?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the merger proposal. You are not, however, entitled to exercise any
appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in connection with
the merger. Because shares of our common stock were listed on the NYSE on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the
virtual special meeting, pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law, our stockholders who object to the merger do not have any appraisal
rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger. For more information, see “No Dissenters’ Rights
of Appraisal.”

Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the virtual special meeting?
A:

filed with the SEC following the virtual special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC’s website at
www.sec.gov when filed.

Can I participate if I am unable to attend the virtual special meeting?
A:
If you are unable to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your
proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet.
Q:
Have any stockholders already agreed to approve the merger?
A:
No. To our knowledge, none of our stockholders have entered into any agreement to vote any of their shares of common stock either in favor or
against any proposal at the virtual special meeting.
Q:
Where can I find more information about the Company?
A:
We file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.pacapts.com. The
information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this proxy statement or

Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the virtual special meeting. Our board of directors is soliciting your proxy on our behalf. In
addition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and
other employees. We have engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc., which we refer to as “MacKenzie Partners,” to assist in the solicitation of proxies for
a fee of $30,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations holding shares in their names,

such beneficial owners and will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing.

“estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “foresee,” “looking ahead,” “is confident,” “should,” “will,” “predicted,” “likely,” or similar words or phrases
intended to identify information that is not historical in nature. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts and assumptions that
involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation:

risks associated with our ability to obtain the stockholder approval required to consummate the merger and the risk that the closing of the
mergers will not occur within the expected timeframe or at all;
•
unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the mergers;

unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the transaction, the response of business partners and competitors to the
announcement of the transaction and/or potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the
transaction;
•
our exclusive remedy against the counterparties to the merger agreement with respect to any breach of the merger agreement being to seek
payment by Parent of the parent termination payment in the amount of $832 million (which amount is guaranteed by the Sponsor), which
may not be adequate to cover our damages;
•
our restricted ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement;
•
general risks affecting the real estate industry;

each of our subsidiary REITs to maintain its qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; and
•
risks related to the novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic.
There can be no assurance that the mergers or any other transaction described above will in fact be consummated in the expected time frame, on the

outbreak of war on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance and those of the Company’s tenants as well as
on the economy and real estate and financial markets, which may impact the timing or occurrence of the mergers. While forward-looking statements reflect
our good-faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future
results, performance or transactions, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” set forth in Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by
the Company with the SEC on February 28, 2022, and subsequent filings by the Company with the SEC. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of
the date on which it is made, and the Company assumes no obligation to update or revise such statement, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

MERGER PROPOSAL
We are asking our stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve the merger of American Campus Communities, Inc. with and into Abacus Merger Sub I
LLC in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.
For detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the mergers and the merger agreement throughout this proxy statement,
including the information set forth under “The Mergers” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this
proxy statement.
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast the majority of all of the votes entitled
to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, but do not
indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 1, your shares will be voted in accordance with the
recommendation of our board of directors, which is “FOR” this Proposal 1. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes
our stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to
your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Approval of this proposal is a condition to the completion of the mergers. In the event this proposal is not approved, the mergers cannot be completed.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, we are asking our
stockholders to vote at the virtual special meeting on an advisory basis regarding the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. Information intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K concerning this
compensation, subject to certain assumptions described therein (including that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination
immediately following the merger effective time), is presented under “The Mergers—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers—
Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers.”
The stockholder vote on this advisory compensation proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our board of directors. Further, the
underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the
advisory vote, if the mergers are completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or become payable
to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the
mergers.
We are asking our stockholders to vote “FOR” the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that American Campus Communities, Inc.’s stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be
paid or become payable to the named executive officers of American Campus Communities, Inc. that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers,
as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under “The Mergers—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers—
Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” beginning on page 60 (which disclosure
includes the Golden Parachute Compensation Table required pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”
Adoption of the above resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. If you
properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or
“ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 2, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors, which is “FOR” this Proposal
2. An abstention or failure to vote on this proposal will have no effect on the approval of this proposal.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
mergers.

We are asking our stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve any adjournments of the virtual special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of this proposal is not a
condition to the completion of the mergers. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, but do not indicate

3.
To consider and vote on a proposal to approve any adjournment of the virtual special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the virtual special meeting to approve the merger proposal.
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting. The
affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special

All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and
attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock is entitled
to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the
record date, our outstanding voting securities consisted of 139,483,032 shares of common stock and 1,171,141 unvested restricted stock awards entitled
to be voted by employees.
The presence in person or by proxy of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the virtual special meeting will
constitute a quorum for purposes of the virtual special meeting. Virtual attendance at the virtual special meeting constitutes presence in person for
quorum purposes at the virtual special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the virtual special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as

special meeting. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common
stock that such holder owned as of the record date. Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our stockholders
are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting
(including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting against
the merger proposal.
In addition, the approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the mergers. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if
you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to
vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the
outcome of these proposals.
Accordingly, in order for your shares to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must either return the enclosed proxy card, authorize your proxy
or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet or vote at the virtual special meeting.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 1,218,039 shares of our common
stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.9% of the total combined voting power of our common stock at the virtual special meeting. Our directors
and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares of our common stock that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor
of the advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.
Votes cast by proxy or at the virtual special meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of election for the virtual special
meeting. The inspector of election will also determine the number of shares of common stock represented at the virtual special meeting, virtually or by

Holders of record of our common stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of the following methods:
•
mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail;
•
authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions included with your proxy
card; or
•
attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast.
Regardless of whether you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares as described above as
promptly as possible.
Under NYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the virtual special meeting.
A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the broker, bank or other nominee has
not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular proposal but
has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if you own common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e.,
in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other
nominee provides to you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals
described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares following the directions
contained in such voting instruction card. If
30Table of Contents
you have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other
nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also vote at
the virtual special meeting. Because the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all
of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting
instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. Because the approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the
adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal, and because your bank, broker or other
nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting
instructions will have no effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

Our board of directors regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans and reviews possible ways of increasing long-term
stockholder value. As part of these evaluations, our board of directors periodically assesses our competitive position and actively monitors industry
trends, our short- and long-term operating performance, our stock price performance, our total stockholder return, our net asset value (“NAV”) and
potential strategic and financial initiatives.
Our long-term strategy has focused on the ownership and operation of differentiated, typically highly amenitized, student housing communities or
development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry that are projected to experience substantial increases in
enrollment and/or are under-serviced in terms of existing on and/or off-campus student housing. Since implementing this strategy, we remained aware of
our numerous challenges as the only remaining publicly-traded U.S. REIT focused on student housing properties, the difficulty in expanding our portfolio
in the context of a competitive student housing industry particularly in light of the volatility of real estate values, interest rates and capitalization rates,
and the discount to estimated NAV at which our common stock has recently traded. These factors, among others, have adversely impacted, and could
continue to adversely impact, our ability to raise capital to fund future acquisitions and development activities at an optimal cost of capital or without
creating significant dilution for our stockholders.
In November 2020, Jonathan Litt, the Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Land & Buildings Capital Growth Fund, LP, a fund managed by Land &
Buildings Investment Management, LLC (“Land & Buildings”), initiated discussion with our board and senior management regarding the Company’s
valuation and strategic objectives, as well as other operational and governance matters. On December 8, 2020, Land & Buildings submitted a notice to the
Company regarding its intent to nominate three people for election to our board at the 2021 annual stockholder meeting. On December 8, 2020, the closing
price of our common stock was $43.01 per share.
In December 2020, the Company engaged BofA Securities to assist the Company and our board in connection with the actions of Land & Buildings and
our ongoing efforts to add additional expertise to our board as well as our ongoing review of strategic and financial initiatives based on BofA Securities’
knowledge of and experience with the Company in light of having regularly advised us on a range of matters. Throughout December 2020 and January
2021, our board’s nominating and corporate governance committee conducted a search process for additional independent directors. During this time, the
nominating and corporate governance committee considered 14 candidates and conducted interviews with nine of these candidates, including Land &
Buildings’ three prospective nominees.
On January 27, 2021, we entered into a cooperation agreement with Land & Buildings, pursuant to which the board appointed Messrs. Bulls and Leupold
and Ms. Hill to the Board, who were three of the candidates
33Table of Contents
identified by the Company. The board also established a capital allocation committee of four members: Mr. Leupold as its chair, Ms. Hill, Ms. Donnell and
Mr. Rippel. On January 27, 2021 the closing price of our common stock was $40.60 per share. The Company publicly disclosed the cooperation agreement
on a Form 8-K on January 28, 2021.
Throughout 2021, our management and board and its committees focused their time and efforts on the re-stabilization of operations despite the
challenges presented by the global pandemic and, as we do in the normal course of our business, continued discussions with BofA Securities and
Dentons, the Company’s outside legal counsel, regarding the evaluation of our stock price performance, total stockholder return, NAV and potential
strategic and financial initiatives.
On November 1, 2021, Mr. Litt sent a letter to Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold that, among other things, informed the Company that Land & Buildings
intended to nominate Mr. Litt for election to the board at our 2022 annual shareholders meeting. Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold shared this letter with our
other directors. Thereafter throughout November 2021, members of our board and management engaged in further correspondence and discussions with
Mr. Litt and Corey Lorinsky, an employee of Land & Buildings.
On November 3, 2021, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Dentons and BofA Securities in
attendance. Our management reviewed and discussed with our board a preliminary draft of our projections for 2022 through 2027 and the assumptions
used to prepare the projections, which information was prepared by management in the normal course of our business and historically provided to our
board at regularly-scheduled quarterly meetings. Representatives of BofA Securities discussed with our board of directors their preliminary financial
analysis of the Company, including current estimates of our NAV, as well as strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company, including
remaining a standalone independent public company or selling or entering into joint ventures with respect to certain of our properties. The board also
discussed the recent correspondence from Mr. Litt.
On November 15, 2021, our board of directors, with members of management, Dentons and BofA Securities in attendance, met to further discuss Land &
Buildings’ intention to nominate Mr. Litt to our board and was updated as to conversations between Mr. Litt and members of our capital allocation
committee and management.
During the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we conducted a competitive process among institutional investors for our capital recycling activity through
a joint venture for the ownership of our existing eight-property Arizona State University (ASU) on-campus student housing portfolio, seven of which
were developed by us in our public-private partnership program, or “P3.” This resulted in our entering into an agreement with Harrison Street’s Social
Infrastructure Platform on December 30, 2021 and provided evidence to us of potentially higher valuations on our P3 on-campus assets than had been
seen in prior transactions with other student housing companies. This transaction was announced on January 13, 2022, on which date the closing price of
our common stock was $56.01 per share.
On December 2, 2021, our board held a meeting, with representatives of management, Dentons and BofA Securities in attendance. The board further
discussed Land & Buildings’ intention to nominate Mr. Litt to our board and was updated as to conversations between Mr. Litt and members of our
capital allocation committee.
During the week of December 6, 2021, William W. Talbot, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, held a series of meetings in New York
City with various potential investors and industry participants to discuss general developments in the student housing industry, which senior
management historically has done in the normal course of our business. Also during these meetings, Mr. Talbot discussed our then current strategic
initiative to identify third party equity for growth opportunities. As a part of this process, on December 8, 2021, at the request of the Company, a
representative of Blackstone met with Mr. Talbot during which this strategic initiative and other potential joint venture opportunities between Blackstone
and the Company were discussed. The Blackstone representative expressed Blackstone’s interest in the student housing
34
Table of Contents
sector, noting that Blackstone owned student housing properties, but informed Mr. Talbot that Blackstone was not interested at that time in engaging in a
joint venture transaction. A potential acquisition of the Company was not discussed. Mr. Talbot reviewed these discussions with potential investors and
industry participants with Mr. Bayless, and thereafter Messrs. Bayless and Talbot updated the members of our board with respect thereto.
On December 13, 2021, Land & Buildings issued a press release announcing that it had sent an open letter to the Company’s shareholders and would be
hosting a conference call on December 16, 2021 to discuss the contents of its letter. On December 13, 2021 the closing price of our common stock was
$55.04 per share. The letter advocated for asset sales by the Company and stated that Land & Buildings would be nominating a director for the board at
the 2022 annual meeting. On December 15, 2021, the board held a meeting, with members of management, Dentons and BofA Securities in attendance, to
discuss the Land & Buildings letter and potential responses.
On December 17, 2021, Land & Buildings sent a letter to the Company nominating Mr. Lorinsky for election to our board at the 2022 annual meeting of
shareholders and also publicly filed documentation with the SEC stating Land & Buildings’ intent to solicit votes for Mr. Lorinsky at the 2022 annual
meeting.
On January 4, 2022, our board held a meeting, with representatives of senior management and Dentons in attendance. At this meeting, the directors
discussed Land & Buildings’ nomination of Mr. Lorinsky for election to the board, and was informed that the members of the nominating and corporate
governance committee recommended against the nomination. Following a discussion of Mr. Lorinsky’s candidacy, the board determined not to nominate
him to the board. On January 5, 2022, Ms. Donnell and Mr. Luck sent a letter to Mr. Litt informing Mr. Litt that after careful consideration the board did not
intend to move forward with Mr. Lorinsky’s candidacy and requested that Land & Buildings withdraw its director nomination and continue to engage
privately and constructively with the Company’s board and management team.
On February 10, 2022, in light of the valuation of our P3 properties in the Harrison Street joint venture transaction, we initiated a discussion with a
strategic buyer in the student housing industry (“Party A”) to solicit an indicative analysis of value of our entire P3 property portfolio, which constitutes
a significant portion of our assets, for use in potential future sale or joint venture transactions involving some or all of the Company’s P3 properties,
including in furtherance of enhancing our strategic capital platform.
On February 15, 2022, the Company received an unsolicited letter from Land & Buildings in which Land & Buildings stated it was “indicating its
willingness to offer to acquire” the Company for $57.00 per share. On February 15, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $50.35 per share.
On February 16, 2022, following discussions among members of the Board, management and the Company’s advisors, we issued a press release (1)
disclosing that the Company had received a nomination of Mr. Lorinsky from Land & Buildings, (2) providing an update on the Company’s extensive
engagement with Land & Buildings, including the receipt of the February 15 letter and our board’s view that Land & Buildings lacked the capital capacity
and transaction experience to execute an acquisition of the Company, and (3) stating that our board is resolute in its commitment to acting in the best
interest of stockholders, and would always consider and respond to a bona fide, actionable proposal from a credible potential counterparty that maximizes
value for stockholders.
We and Party A executed a confidentiality agreement on February 18, 2022 regarding the provision of information relating to our P3 property portfolio,
which did not include a “standstill” provision. Thereafter, we provided materials to Party A relating to property-level performance for the limited purpose
of analyzing our P3 property portfolio.
On February 22, 2022, Mr. Talbot received an unsolicited telephone call from a representative of a financial buyer (“Party B”), to, in light of the public
disclosure of the overtures from Land & Buildings, request that if the
35
Table of Contents
Company were to engage in a sale process, Party B be included in such a process. The representative of Party B did not provide Mr. Talbot with an
indication of value, its proposed sources of capital or a proposed transaction structure. Mr. Talbot informed Party B that he would inform Mr. Bayless and
the other members of the board of the discussion, which was subsequently done. There were no additional discussions between the Company and Party
B, or their respective representatives, until BofA Securities contacted Party B on March 15, 2022 at the direction of our board, as discussed below.
On February 28, 2022, a representative of Blackstone called a representative of BofA Securities to express Blackstone’s high degree of interest in the
potential acquisition of the Company, noting that Blackstone had performed initial due diligence based on publicly available information. The
representative of BofA Securities stated that he would convey Blackstone’s interest to the Company, but that he did not believe the Company would
consider any proposal unless the price exceeded the $57.00 per share price proposed by Land & Buildings. Blackstone’s representative stated that
Blackstone could quickly complete its due diligence review and indicated that Blackstone would not require any financing contingency if the Company
were to pursue a transaction with Blackstone.
By letter dated March 1, 2022 from Ms. Donnell to Land & Buildings, Ms. Donnell requested information regarding Land & Buildings’ sources and uses
of funding and informed Land & Buildings that the board did not believe the proposed price appropriately valued the Company. On March 1, 2022, the
closing price of our common stock was $53.24 per share.
Also on March 1, 2022, Party A submitted a preliminary non-binding indicative value analysis of our P3 property portfolio based on applying a fixed
discount rate to all of our P3 properties, with a caveat that any upward movement in interest rates would significantly impact the analysis.
On March 2, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Dentons and BofA Securities in
attendance. Representatives of BofA Securities discussed with our board of directors the current interest rate, capital market and M&A environments as
well as the February 28, 2022 discussion with Blackstone. The board also discussed the recent correspondence with Mr. Litt and the indicative value
analysis of our P3 property portfolio from Party A.
On March 14, 2022, our board held a meeting with members of senior management and representatives of Dentons and BofA Securities in attendance. At
the meeting, BofA Securities provided our board with an overview of general market trends in the student housing real estate industry and the broader
REIT market, including the fact that our shares generally traded in the public markets at a discount to our NAV, certain publicly available information
regarding implied premiums paid in selected precedent transactions in the REIT industry, and strategic alternatives that may be available to us, including
a sale of the Company, remaining a standalone public company or selling or entering into joint ventures with respect to some of our properties.
Management reviewed with our board an updated version of managements’ projections for 2022 through 2027, reflecting the 2022 budget and 2021 actual
data (the “updated management financial projections”), which are discussed in more detail under “—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.”
Representatives of BofA Securities then discussed with our board of directors their preliminary financial analysis of the Company and, among other
items, current capital and other market and geopolitical conditions and their potential impact on the Company and a sale transaction. A discussion ensued
among the directors, management, Dentons, and BofA Securities regarding, among other things, risks and considerations related to opportunities to grow
our business, challenges we face and that could arise in the future, the cost of obtaining capital and the amount of capital needed to acquire all of our
common stock for cash. The board also considered factors that indicated it was an opportune time to engage in a sale of the Company, including, among
others, favorable valuations in recent precedent transactions in the REIT industry, the indicative value analysis of our P3 property portfolio prepared by
Party A and the risks inherent in delaying any sale in light of recent increases in interest rates and the likelihood that capitalization and interest rates
would continue to rise, which would make it more expensive for a potential buyer to finance a transaction at a later time, changes in geopolitical
conditions and the other challenges

Table of Contents
currently facing the Company. Members of our senior management also reviewed and discussed with our board of directors potential risks to the
Company from leaks that may result from reaching out to potential bidders to acquire the Company, which could result in damage to our relationships
with our university partners, and determined that any sale transaction should be conducted in an expeditious manner in order to mitigate such risks. A
representative of Dentons reviewed the directors’ duties under Maryland law in connection with a potential acquisition of the Company and
representatives of Dentons and BofA Securities discussed with the board various potential processes for a sale transaction, such as a reduced
termination fee for a period of time after entering into a merger agreement to facilitate competing proposals from other bidders while having a binding
agreement to sell the Company. After discussion, the board authorized BofA Securities to initiate discussions with Party B and Blackstone, which were
viewed as parties whose size and investment experience demonstrated they could be credible bidders for the Company, to determine if either was
interested in providing its views on the valuation of the Company. The board also authorized the Company to enter into confidentiality agreements with
Blackstone and Party B and to provide them with diligence materials, and instructed BofA Securities to inform Ms. Donnell, as the chair of our board, and
Mr. Leupold, as the chair of the capital allocation committee of our board, of any responses from Party B and Blackstone. Our board also directed
members of management to refrain from having discussions with Blackstone and Party B regarding the roles or compensation, if any, of management
following the closing of any transaction. Management agreed not to engage in such discussions.
On March 14, 2022, as directed by our board, representatives of BofA Securities called a representative of Blackstone and a representative of Party B to
explore each’s interest in providing its views regarding the valuation of the Company, and subsequently sent to each a draft confidentiality agreement.
BofA Securities notified our management, Ms. Donnell, Mr. Leupold and Dentons of these conversations.
On March 17, 2022, Blackstone entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company, which contained a customary “standstill” provision that
prevented Blackstone from, among other things, making a proposal with respect to an acquisition of the Company except on a confidential basis to the
Company. On March 18, 2022, a representative of BofA Securities emailed a representative of Blackstone requesting that, if Blackstone was interested in
providing a view on valuation, to respond by March 25, 2022 and include Blackstone’s key valuation assumptions and thinking around the financing
related to the potential transaction. The representative of BofA Securities also offered to arrange due diligence calls with management. Commencing on
March 18, 2022, the Company provided due diligence materials to Blackstone, and members of management, with the participation of representatives of
BofA Securities, had multiple discussions with representatives of Blackstone regarding Blackstone’s due diligence review of the Company and its
business.
During a telephone conversation initiated by a representative of Party B on March 22, 2022, Party B informed BofA Securities that Party B declined to
execute a confidentiality agreement or to further engage regarding the potential acquisition of the Company because, among other matters, due to recent
volatility and deterioration in the debt and financial markets, Party B did not think it would be able to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms in
order to be able to enter into an agreement for an acquisition of the Company at this time.
On March 24, 2022, our board of directors was provided a letter from BofA Securities with respect to certain relationships with Blackstone, which we refer
to as the “BofA Securities Disclosure Letter.”
On March 25, 2022, Blackstone provided a letter to our board, proposing to acquire all of our outstanding common stock for $63.00 per share in cash
(representing an approximate 16% premium to the $54.41 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on March 24, 2022). The letter stated
that Blackstone would proceed without any financing contingency and was prepared to complete its remaining confirmatory due diligence and
concurrently negotiate a definitive merger agreement within two weeks. Blackstone separately confirmed to BofA Securities that Blackstone was prepared
to move expeditiously and use the fully negotiated agreement from Blackstone’s recently announced acquisition of Preferred Apartment Communities,
Inc. as a precedent agreement for the proposed transaction with the Company.

On March 25, 2022, Land & Buildings filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC in connection with its nomination of Mr. Lorinsky to the board at
the 2022 annual stockholder meeting.
On March 27 and 29, 2022, our board held meetings with members of our senior management team and representatives from BofA Securities and Dentons
in attendance. During the meeting, representatives of BofA Securities reviewed with our board the discussions with Blackstone and Party B since the last
meeting of our board on March 14, including the terms of Blackstone’s proposal and the fact that Party B declined to further engage regarding a potential
acquisition of the Company, and that no other parties had expressed interest in acquiring the Company following the Company’s press release of
February 16, 2022 relating to the Land & Buildings proposal, and that there had been no engagement with Land & Buildings since that date.
Representatives of BofA Securities then discussed with our board of directors an update to their preliminary financial analysis of the Company and,
among other items, current capital and other market and geopolitical conditions and their potential impact on the Company and a sale transaction. A
discussion ensued among the directors, management and our outside counsel and financial advisor regarding, among other things, risks and
considerations related to opportunities to grow our business, challenges we face and that could arise in the future, the cost of obtaining capital, reasons
why Blackstone might be able to realize more value from the business than another bidder and thereby pay a higher price to acquire the Company,
including Blackstone’s low cost of capital, substantial available capital and interest in student housing properties and platform, and the amount of capital
needed to acquire all of our common stock for cash. Our board of directors discussed with management and our advisors the best process for maximizing
stockholder value if the Company were to be sold, including whether a competitive bidding process would yield a higher price than Blackstone’s proposal
and the use of a two-tiered termination fee structure to facilitate competing bids after signing a merger agreement, as well as benefits and risks to the
Company and its business posed by contacting other potential bidders, including the risk that engaging with or contacting other potential bidders prior
to signing a definitive agreement with Blackstone could jeopardize the availability of Blackstone’s proposal. Our board also discussed with management
and our advisors other potential risks and considerations that included the lack of public strategic buyers as the Company is the only public student
housing company, the limited universe of potential third parties with the financial ability to acquire the Company in light of the size of the Company, the
recent increase in interest rates and the expectation that interest rates would continue to rise, which would make it more expensive for a potential buyer to
finance a transaction, concerns about the possibility of a leak that the Company was exploring a possible sale disrupting our university relationships
including our ability to pursue P3 transactions during a period of uncertainty and risking employee turnover. Following further discussion, our board of
directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue to engage in discussions with Blackstone and
directed Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold to present Blackstone with a counterproposal for a purchase price of $66.00 per share of common stock in cash.
During the March 27, 2022 board meeting, representatives of BofA Securities described its qualifications and experience with these types of transactions.
Following the departure of the BofA Securities representatives from the meeting, our board discussed with management and a representative of Dentons
the contemplated engagement of BofA Securities as our financial advisor with respect to a potential sale of the Company, BofA Securities’ relationships
with Blackstone and the fees to be paid to BofA Securities in connection with their engagement. After considering the overall reputation, experience and
qualifications of BofA Securities, as well as BofA Securities’ knowledge of the student housing and broader real estate market and our business and
properties in particular, and information provided by BofA Securities in the BofA Securities Disclosure Letter as discussed under “—Opinion of Our
Financial Advisor,” our board unanimously approved the engagement of BofA Securities as our financial advisor with respect to a potential sale of the
Company and authorized management and Dentons to finalize the engagement letter with BofA Securities.
Also during these meetings, the directors and a representative of Dentons discussed the best way to proceed with future negotiations with Blackstone
given the directors’ view that expediting the transaction process would be critical to minimizing risks to the Company. Our board determined to form a
special committee of directors consisting of independent directors (Mss. Donnell and Hill and Messrs. Leupold and Rippel) in order to
38
Table of Contents
expeditiously evaluate and handle future negotiations with Blackstone. Our board also discussed the interests of our executive officers in the mergers
that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally, as discussed under “—Interests of our Directors and Executive Officers in
the Mergers.”
On March 30, 2022, Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold, joined by Mr. Bayless and a representative of BofA Securities, communicated the Company’s
counteroffer of $66.00 per share of common stock in cash to representatives of Blackstone. A representative of Blackstone stated that, if it were provided
with additional due diligence information, Blackstone may be able to increase its $63.00 per share price, and the representative of BofA Securities
indicated that the Company was prepared to provide access to additional due diligence information so that Blackstone could seek to improve its price.
On March 31, 2022, representatives of the Company and Blackstone met in person at our corporate office in Austin, Texas as part of Blackstone’s
ongoing due diligence review.
On April 5, 2022, a representative of Blackstone verbally communicated to representatives of BofA Securities that Blackstone was prepared to increase its
purchase price from $63.00 to $65.00 per share (representing an approximate 15% premium to the $56.74 per share closing price of the Company’s common
stock on April 4, 2022), which was confirmed in a letter received that day from Blackstone addressed to our board.
Also on April 5, 2022, our board held a meeting with members of our senior management team and representatives from BofA Securities and Dentons in
attendance. During the meeting, the Company’s board received an update regarding the discussions with Blackstone since the meeting of our board on
March 27, including the increase in price in Blackstone’s revised proposal. BofA Securities reviewed recent geopolitical risks and interest rate and market
volatility, as well as an update to the financial analysis of the common stock consideration. The group reviewed discussions held at earlier meetings
regarding the performance of the Company’s business and its prospects as an independent company and concluded that there was a risk that Blackstone
could withdraw or adversely modify its proposal, particularly in light of the limited number of third parties with the financial ability to acquire the
Company for cash without a financing contingency given the size of the Company, and that the Company should continue to negotiate the Blackstone
proposal on an expedited basis to protect the Company’s business and maximize stockholder value. The board authorized BofA Securities to let
Blackstone know that the Company was prepared to continue discussions regarding a potential acquisition of the Company.
In light of Blackstone’s increased price, following the board meeting on April 5, 2022, a representative of BofA Securities called representatives of
Blackstone and indicated that the Company was prepared to continue discussions with Blackstone regarding a potential acquisition of the Company.
Beginning on April 6, 2022, we opened a virtual data room to provide Blackstone with access to additional due diligence information and thereafter
Blackstone continued its due diligence review and conducted site visits at a number of our properties, including our Disney project. As part of this due
diligence review, which continued until the execution of the definitive merger agreement, the parties and their representatives engaged in various
discussions regarding the Company and its business, operations, activities and financial information.
On April 8, 2022, Blackstone’s outside counsel, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (“Simpson Thacher”), sent to Dentons drafts of a merger agreement,
limited guaranty and equity commitment letter. The draft merger agreement contemplated that, among other things, (i) the Company would merge with and
into a wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Blackstone and another wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Blackstone would merge with and into
the Partnership, with the respective holders of shares of the Company’s common stock and units in the Partnership to receive the same cash
consideration per share or unit, (ii) the Company would be subject to customary prohibitions on soliciting alternative proposals with a two-tier
termination fee (equal to 2.0% of the Company’s equity value if the Company terminated the merger agreement within 40 days after signing the merger
agreement with Blackstone to accept a superior proposal received during the first 30 days
39
Table of Contents
after signing the merger agreement with Blackstone, and otherwise 3.5% of the Company’s equity value ), along with matching rights if any superior
proposal were received and a reverse termination fee of 9% of the Company’s equity value payable by Blackstone in certain circumstances as an
exclusive remedy with no specific performance, (iii) the Company would not be permitted to pay any dividends other than those necessary to maintain
REIT status with the per share purchase price being decreased by an amount equal to any such dividends, and (iv) subject to certain exceptions, the
Company would be permitted flexibility to continue to operate in the ordinary course of business prior to closing.
On April 10, 2022, a representative of BofA Securities called representatives of Blackstone regarding the initial draft of the merger agreement provided by
Simpson Thacher. As compared to Blackstone’s initial draft, the Company proposed that (i) the lower termination fee be reduced from 2.0% to 1.5% of the
Company’s equity value if the Company terminated the merger agreement within 40 days after signing the merger agreement with Blackstone to accept a
superior proposal received during the first 30 days after signing the merger agreement with Blackstone and otherwise from 3.5% to 3.0% of the
Company’s equity value and (ii) that the Company be permitted to continue paying its regular quarterly dividends prior to the closing of a transaction.
On April 11, 2022, Dentons sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Simpson Thacher which, among other things, contemplated the changes
regarding termination fees and ability to pay dividends proposed by representatives of BofA Securities to representatives of Blackstone on the previous
day.
Between April 11, 2022 and April 13, 2022, the special committee, with the assistance of Dentons and BofA Securities, and Blackstone, with the assistance
of Simpson Thacher, continued to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement. The negotiations covered various aspects of the transaction, including,
among other things, the representations and warranties made by the parties, the restriction on the conduct of the Company’s business until completion of
the transaction, the conditions to completion of the mergers, the termination provisions and the amounts of termination fee payable by us, our ability to
pay quarterly dividends between signing and closing, and provisions regarding our equity awards, employee benefit plans, retention, severance and
other compensation matters. Blackstone confirmed that it would agree to accept the Company’s proposed two-tier termination fee of 1.5% and 3.0% of the
Company’s equity value, but that the Company should not be permitted to pay any quarterly dividends between signing and closing. Blackstone
continued its confirmatory due diligence until the execution of the merger agreement on April 18, 2022 and the parties continued to exchange drafts of the
merger agreement and related documentation until then.
On April 11, 2022, our board received a letter from Mr. Litt notifying it that Land & Buildings was withdrawing its director nominee, which the Company
publicly disclosed on a Form 8-K on April 13, 2022.
On April 12, 2022, Mss. Donnell and Hill, as members of the special committee and the chair of the board and compensation committee, respectively, and
Mr. Bayless discussed and negotiated with Blackstone the terms of certain compensation and severance matters relating to the Company’s senior
management and other employees relating to retention and continuity of operations, which are described elsewhere in this proxy statement.
On April 14, 2022, representatives of the special committee, Company management, Dentons and BofA Securities, and Blackstone and Simpson Thacher,
discussed the terms of the merger agreement, including the Company’s position that it should be permitted to continue to pay regular quarterly
dividends.
On April 16, 2022, our board met with members of our management team and representatives from BofA Securities and Dentons in attendance during
which the special committee and our legal and financial advisors provided an update on the negotiations with Blackstone, including with respect to
Blackstone’s proposed restriction on the Company paying dividends during the pendency of the merger agreement. The board discussed the terms of
Blackstone’s latest proposal and agreed to respond by proposing either the right to pay the regular dividend of $0.47 per share for the first quarter after
signing the merger agreement or a corresponding increase to the purchase price. Representatives of BofA Securities discussed Blackstone’s liquidity to
support its equity commitment. Representatives of BofA Securities also presented to our board BofA Securities’ updated financial
40
Table of Contents
analysis of the common stock consideration. A representative of Dentons noted that BofA Securities had provided an update to BofA Securities
Disclosure Letter identifying relationships between BofA Securities and Blackstone, a copy of which had been provided to the directors prior to this
meeting, and summarized the merger agreement and other transaction documentation, copies of which had also been provided to the directors prior to
this meeting, noting that they were substantially complete and it would be possible, if the board were to approve the transaction, to sign the merger
agreement before the market opened on April 19, 2022, subject to resolution of the dividend payment issue.
Following the meeting, at the direction of the board, Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold verbally communicated our counterproposal to a representative of
Blackstone regarding the quarterly dividend. On April 18, 2022, a representative of Blackstone informed Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold that Blackstone
was prepared to increase the purchase price from $65.00 a share to $65.47 per share (representing a premium of approximately 22% to the 90-calendar day
volume-weighted average share price ending April 18, 2022, a premium of approximately 30% over the closing stock price of February 16, 2022, the date
immediately prior to the Company disclosing receipt of an indication of willingness to offer to acquire the Company, and a premium of approximately 14%
over the closing stock price on April 18, 2022 of $57.58 per share) but that the Company would not be permitted to pay any regular quarterly dividends
following the execution of the merger agreement.
On April 18, 2022, the special committee held a meeting with representatives of BofA Securities and Dentons in attendance. Ms. Donnell and Mr. Leupold
informed the other members of the special committee of the response from Blackstone to increase the purchase price to $65.47 and prohibit subsequent
dividends. After discussion, the special committee unanimously recommended that our board of directors approve the merger agreement with Blackstone.
Later in the day on April 18, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives from BofA Securities
and Dentons in attendance. Ms. Donnell updated the board on the discussions with Blackstone and informed the board that the special committee had
met earlier that day and unanimously recommended the approval of the merger agreement with Blackstone. A representative of Dentons reviewed with
our board the duties of directors under applicable law and the application of those duties to the evaluation of a potential sale of the Company and the
proposed terms of the merger agreement and other transaction documents and discussed the changes that had been made to the documents since the
board of directors’ meeting held on April 16, 2022, which changes were reflected in marked copies of the documents provided to our board of directors in
advance of the meeting. A representative of Dentons also reviewed certain employee-related matters that were addressed in the merger agreement,
including the effect that the mergers would have on the Company’s existing employee benefits plans and outstanding equity awards and certain amounts
that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers as a result of the mergers and that the interests of our executive officers
in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally, as discussed under “—Interests of our Directors and
Executive Officers in the Mergers.” A representative of Dentons then reviewed with the board a proposed amendment to the Company’s bylaws that
would make specified state and federal courts in Maryland the sole and exclusive forum for litigation relating to the Company’s internal affairs, including
stockholder derivative suits and alleged breaches of duties owed to stockholders, and the federal district courts in the United States the sole and
exclusive forum for litigation arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. BofA Securities then reviewed with our board BofA Securities’
financial analysis of the merger consideration to be paid to stockholders and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
April 18, 2022, to our board of directors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations and qualifications described in the opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders of the Company’s
common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (other than Parent and its affiliates). A representative of Dentons then reviewed the
proposed resolutions prepared for the proposed transaction, including the engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. as an additional financial
proposed resolutions prepared for the proposed transaction, including the engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. as an additional financial
advisor to the Company. Following these presentations and discussions, and other discussions by our board of directors concerning, among other
things, the matters described below under “—Reasons for the Mergers,”

including our board of directors’ belief that the mergers are more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic transactions available to the
Company, including remaining as an independent public company, our board of directors unanimously determined the mergers to be advisable, approved
the mergers on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and resolved to recommend the approval of the mergers by our stockholders.
Following the board of directors’ meeting, BofA Securities contacted representatives of Blackstone to advise them that our board of directors had
unanimously approved the proposed transaction.
During the evening of April 18, 2022, the Company, affiliates of Blackstone and the other parties thereto executed and delivered the merger agreement.
The Company issued a press release publicly announcing the mergers and execution of the merger agreement before the opening of the market on April
19, 2022.

In reaching its unanimous decision to determine and declare the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, to be
advisable and in our and our stockholders’ best interests and to approve the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend that the holders of common stock approve the merger proposal,
the board of directors consulted with our senior management team, as well as our financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors,
including the following material factors which the board of directors viewed as supporting its decision:
•
the current and historical trading prices of shares of our common stock, and the fact that the merger consideration of $65.47 per share in
cash represents a premium of approximately 22% to the 90-calendar day volume-weighted average share price ending April 18, 2022, a
premium of approximately 30% over the closing stock price of February 16, 2022, the date immediately prior to our disclosing receipt of an
indication of willingness to offer to acquire us, and a premium of approximately 14% over the closing price of our common stock on April 18,
2022;
•
the fact that the trading price of our common stock has consistently represented a significant discount to our NAV per share;
•
the risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company, including the Company’s need to frequently raise capital due to
the capital-intensive nature of the Company’s business, the difficulty and cost of obtaining capital and challenges of acquiring student
housing real estate assets on an accretive basis;
•
that the Company is the only publicly-traded U.S. REIT focused on student housing properties, making it unlikely that a public company
buyer existed, but if a public company buyer existed, a private buyer might be able to realize more value from the business than a public
company buyer and thereby pay a higher price to acquire the Company, including the ability of private companies to use higher leverage to
pursue growth that is more accretive, to absorb near-term dilution from capital expenditures in favor of longer-term growth and to fund
developments without having to rely on the volatility of equity capital markets;
•
the fact that the merger consideration was the result of arm’s-length negotiations and that we negotiated two price increases by Blackstone
from its initial proposed price of $63.00 per share and the board of directors’ belief that the merger consideration was the maximum price that
Blackstone was willing to pay;
•
our board of directors’ belief that, in light of Blackstone’s low cost of capital, substantial available capital, interest in student housing
properties and recent significant real estate acquisitions, Blackstone was the possible acquiror likely to offer the highest price for the
Company;
42Table of Contents
•
our board of directors’ belief that there exists a limited universe of potential third parties with the financial ability to acquire the Company in
light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of our common stock;
•
the board of directors’ beliefs that contacting other potential bidders before announcing a transaction would result in significant risks to the
Company and its business, including concerns about leaks regarding a potential transaction could disrupt university relationships,
jeopardize university transactions currently in the pipeline and risk employee turnover, as well as leading to turnover in the Company’s
stockholder base and potential stock price volatility;
•
our right to terminate the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of a superior proposal, upon payment of the company termination payment;
•
the fact that the two-tiered company termination payment of $139 million, representing approximately 1.5% of the Company’s equity value
and approximately 1.1% of the Company’s enterprise value, and $278 million, representing approximately 3.0% of the Company’s equity
value and 2.2% of the Company’s enterprise value, were viewed by our board of directors, after consultation with our outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, as reasonable under the circumstances and not likely to preclude any other from making a superior proposal;
•
our right, in certain circumstances in response to unsolicited competing proposals, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with
third parties;
•
the right of our board of directors under the merger agreement to change, withhold, qualify or withdraw its recommendation that the holders
of common stock approve the merger under certain circumstances, subject to payment of the company termination payment if Parent elects
to terminate the merger agreement in such circumstances;
•
the fact that the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately
upon the closing of the merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent or greater value
from our business plan for our properties or other possible strategic alternatives (including entering into sale or joint venture transactions
involving a portfolio of student housing properties);
•
the knowledge of our board of directors of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of the Company, including
its assets, as well as its knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which the Company and each of its businesses operate,
including economic, market and capital raising conditions;
•
the belief that the merger is more favorable to the Company’s stockholders than other strategic alternatives available to the Company,
including remaining as an independent public company, the feasibility of such alternatives and the significant risks and uncertainties
associated with pursuing such alternatives;
•
the belief that conditions for a sale transaction in the real estate market are generally favorable and the likelihood that interest rates may
continue to rise in the future, which would increase a buyer’s financing costs resulting in less favorable conditions for sale transactions in
the real estate markets;
•
the high probability that the mergers would be completed based on, among other things, Blackstone’s substantial available capital, proven
ability to complete large acquisition transactions, Blackstone’s extensive experience in the real estate industry, the absence of a financing
contingency and the $832 million parent termination fee, payment payable to the Company if the merger agreement is terminated in certain
circumstances (representing approximately 9.0% of the Company’s equity value and approximately 6.5% of the Company’s enterprise value),
which payment is guaranteed by BREIT Operating Partnership L.P.;

•
the financial analysis and opinion provided by BofA Securities, dated April 18, 2022, to our board of directors as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the common stock consideration to be received by holders of our common stock,
as more fully described in the section entitled “—Opinion of Our Financial Advisor.” The full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to
this proxy statement;
•
that the merger consideration of $65.47 per share in cash is above each of the implied per share equity value reference ranges indicated by
the material financial analyses performed by BofA Securities with respect to its opinion;
•
that the board of directors of the Company delegated to a special committee the responsibility and authority to consider and negotiate the
proposal received by the Company from Parent with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and that the
special committee unanimously recommended to the board the approval of the Merger Agreement;
•
that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement were reviewed by the independent special committee and the board of directors with
our financial and legal advisors, and the fact that such terms were the product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties; and
•
the fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and our stockholders would be free to reject the merger by
voting against the merger for any reason, including if a higher offer were to be made prior to the stockholders’ meeting (in certain cases
subject to payment by the Company of an $278 million company termination payment if the Company subsequently were to enter into a
definitive agreement relating to, or to consummate, a competing proposal).
The board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the merger agreement and the merger:
•
our inability to solicit competing proposals and the possibility that the company termination payment payable by us upon the termination of
the merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential bidders from making a competing bid to acquire us;
•
the fact that, following the mergers, the Company will no longer exist as an independent public company and our existing stockholders will
not participate in any future earnings or growth;
•
the risk that an alternative transaction or different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial to our stockholders than the
proposed merger with Blackstone;
•
the fact that the mergers might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, due to a failure of certain conditions to the closing of the
mergers, including the risk that our stockholders do not approve the merger proposal;
•
the fact that if any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II fails, or threatens to fail, to satisfy its obligations under the merger agreement,
we are not entitled to specifically enforce the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter, and that our exclusive remedy, available if
the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, would be limited to the parent termination payment in the amount of $832
million (the payment of which is guaranteed by BREIT Operating Partnership L.P.), and that such payment would need to be structured in a
manner to maintain our qualification as a REIT;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the mergers, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking
business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the mergers;
•
the fact that, under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company is not permitted to make, declare or pay regular quarterly cash
dividends on common stock;
•
the fact that the receipt of the cash consideration in the merger would be taxable to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
44
Table of Contents
•
the fact that, under Maryland law, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or similar rights of an objecting
stockholder in connection with the merger;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger agreement and completing the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and the substantial time and effort of management required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and related disruptions to the operation of our business;
•
the fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the failure to complete the
mergers, and/or actions that the Company may be required, or Parent may be permitted, to take under the merger agreement could have an
adverse impact on our existing and prospective business relationships with tenants and other third parties and on our employees; and
•
the fact that some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, our
stockholders generally (see “—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”).
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material factors
considered by the board of directors. In reaching its decision to determine and declare the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the mergers, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders and to approve the execution, delivery and performance of
the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend that the holders of common stock
approve the merger proposal, the board of directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to, and did not make specific assessments of, the
factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The board of directors did not reach any specific
conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered.
The above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking
statements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements.”
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
Our board of directors has unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement and determined the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our
stockholders. Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR”
the adjournment proposal.

As a matter of general practice, due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections, we do
not publicly disclose detailed projections as to our anticipated financial position or results of operations, other than providing, from time to time,
estimated ranges for the then-current fiscal year of certain expected financial results and operational metrics in our regular earnings press releases and
other investor materials.
However, in connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction, our management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information for
the Company on a consolidated basis for fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2027, which we refer to as the “financial
projections”, which is summarized below. Such financial projections were provided to our board of directors and to BofA Securities for use in connection
with its financial analyses and fairness opinion.
45Table of Contents
These financial projections were not intended for public disclosure, and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC,
the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts or generally
accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have
audited, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the projections nor expressed an opinion or any form of assurance on the financial
projections or their achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, such financial projections. A summary of the
financial projections is included in this proxy statement only because the financial projections were made available to our board of directors and BofA
Securities as described in this proxy statement. The inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or
representation by us that the information contained therein is material information.
In the view of our management, the financial projections were prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting management’s best available estimates and
judgments regarding our future financial performance at the time they were prepared. The financial projections have been included only to reflect
information made available to our board of directors and BofA Securities at the time of certain events and decisions, are not facts and should not be relied
upon as indicative of actual future results, and you are cautioned not to rely on the financial projections. Some or all of the assumptions that have been
made in connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial projections were prepared. None of
the Company or any of our affiliates, advisors or other representatives assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or
completeness of the financial projections. Neither the Company nor any of our affiliates have or intend to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to,
update, revise or correct the financial projections if any or all of them have become or become inaccurate (even in the short term) since the time of their
preparation. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the financial projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.
The financial projections do not reflect changes in general business or economic conditions since the time they were prepared, changes in our
businesses or prospects since the time they were prepared, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not
anticipated at the time the financial projections were prepared, and the financial projections are not necessarily indicative of current values or future
performance, which may be significantly more favorable or less favorable than as set forth below and should not be regarded as a representation that the
financial projections will be achieved. The projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. In addition,
our future financial performance may be affected by our ability to successfully implement a number of initiatives to improve our operations and financial
performance and our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods.
Because the financial projections reflect subjective judgment in many respects, they are susceptible to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions
based on actual experience and business developments. The financial projections also cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes
less predictive with each succeeding year. The estimates and assumptions underlying the financial projections involve judgments with respect to, among
other things, economic, competitive and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject
to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the
business and economic conditions affecting the industries in which we operate. The financial projections constitute forward-looking information and are
subject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results. For
additional information on factors that may cause our future financial results to materially vary from the projected results summarized below, see
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 22 of this proxy statement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that the projected results summarized below will be realized or that actual results will not differ materially from the projected results summarized below, and
the financial projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon as such. Neither we

nor our affiliates nor advisors nor any other person has made any representation to any of our stockholders or any other person regarding our actual
performance compared to the results included in the financial projections. We have not made any representation to Blackstone or its affiliates, in the
merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the financial projections.
The financial projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in our
public filings with the SEC. The financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared,
including the mergers. Further, the financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the mergers to be consummated and should
not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
Financial Projections
The following table summarizes the financial projections of the Company that were provided to our board of directors in connection with the evaluation
of a possible transaction. The following financial projections were also provided to BofA Securities by us for use in connection with its financial analyses
and the fairness opinion rendered to our board of directors (summarized under “—Opinion of Our Financial Advisor” beginning on page 48 of this proxy
statement).
Our management made various assumptions when preparing the financial projections. These assumptions included compound annual revenue growth of
approximately 9% from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027, compound annual consolidated net operating income growth of approximately 10%
from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027, compound annual net operating income (at share) growth of approximately 10% from fiscal year end 2022
to fiscal year end 2027, compound annual EBITDA (at share) growth of approximately 10% from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027, compound
annual funds from operations-modified (“FFOM”) growth of approximately 10% from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027 and compound annual
FFOM per share growth of approximately 7% from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2027.

Net operating income (“NOI”) is calculated as property revenues less direct operating expenses, excluding depreciation, but including an allocation
of costs related to corporate management and oversight.
(2)
NOI (at share) is NOI adjusted for our ownership interest in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.
(3)
EBITDA (at share) is calculated as Owned Properties NOI (at share) plus third-party development and management services revenue, on-campus
participating property (“OCPP”) management fees and interest on a loan we made to the owner of one OCPP, our share of OCPP net cash flow, and
interest income minus third-party development and management services expense, ground/facility leases expense, general and administrative
expense, and OCPP overhead.
(4)
Unlevered Free Cash Flow is calculated as EBITDA (at share) plus proceeds from the sale of properties or interests in properties less capital
expenditures, such as acquisitions, renovations, development, investments in joint venture properties and property upgrades and maintenance.

Table of Contents
(5)
FFOM is calculated as funds from operations (FFO) modified to reflect certain adjustments related to the economic performance of our OCPPs and
excludes other items, as we determined in good faith, that do not reflect our core operations on a comparative basis. We believe it is meaningful to
eliminate the FFO generated from the OCPPs and instead to reflect our 50% share of the properties’ net cash flow and management and
development fees received, as this measure better reflects the economic benefit derived from our involvement in the operation of these properties.
FFO was determined based on the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
(NAREIT) and is calculated as consolidated net income or loss attributable to common shares computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains
or losses from depreciable operating property sales, impairment charges and real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO and FFOM may differ from methodologies utilized by other equity REITs
for similar performance measurements and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other REITs.
(6)
NOI, EBITDA, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and FFOM are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as an alternative to net
income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed
in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our liquidity, nor are these measures indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our
ability to pay dividends or make distributions.
Opinion of Our Financial Advisor
The Company has retained BofA Securities to act as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the mergers. BofA Securities is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
The Company selected BofA Securities to act as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the mergers on the basis of the Company’s prior
retention of BofA Securities in various investment banking matters, BofA Securities’ experience in transactions similar to the mergers, its reputation in the
investment community and its familiarity with the Company and its business.
On April 18, 2022, BofA Securities delivered to our board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion, dated April 18, 2022,
to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the common
stock consideration to be received by holders of our common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of BofA Securities’ written opinion, dated April 18, 2022, to our board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by BofA Securities in
rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of
BofA Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Securities delivered its opinion to our board of
directors for the benefit and use of our board of directors (in its capacity as our board of directors) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation
of the common stock consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any terms or other aspects or implications
of the mergers and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the mergers in comparison to other strategies or transactions that
might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with or
effect the mergers. BofA Securities’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the
proposed mergers or any other matter.
In connection with its opinion, BofA Securities, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company;
48
Table of Contents
•
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of the Company
furnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by the management of the Company, including certain financial forecasts relating to the
Company prepared by the management of the Company, which are described under “—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” and
referred to in the proxy statement as the “updated management financial projections”;
•
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company with members of senior
management of the Company;
•
reviewed the trading history for our common stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories of other companies
BofA Securities deemed relevant;
•
compared certain financial and stock market information of the Company with similar information of other companies BofA Securities
deemed relevant;
•
compared certain financial terms of the mergers to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions BofA Securities
deemed relevant;
•
reviewed a draft, dated April 18, 2022, of the merger agreement (which we refer to in this section of this proxy statement as the “Draft
Agreement”); and
•
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Securities deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and
other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with BofA Securities and BofA Securities relied upon
the assurances of the management of the Company that it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data
inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the updated management financial projections, BofA Securities was advised by the
Company, and BofA Securities assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then-currently available estimates and good
faith judgments of the management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. BofA Securities did not make and was not
provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor did it make any physical
inspection of the properties or assets of the Company. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Company or Parent under any
state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of the Company, that the
mergers would be consummated in accordance with their respective terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or
agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the
mergers, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that
would have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the mergers. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of the
Company, that the final executed merger agreement did not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Securities.
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the mergers (other than the common stock consideration
to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the mergers, any related transaction or any other
agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to the mergers or otherwise. BofA Securities’ opinion was limited to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the common stock consideration to be received by the holders of our common stock and no opinion or view
was expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the mergers by the holders of any other class of securities or any creditors
or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount,
nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the mergers, or class of such persons,
relative to the common
49
Table of Contents
stock consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the mergers in comparison to other strategies
or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the Company
to proceed with or effect the mergers. BofA Securities did not express any opinion with respect to, and relied, at the direction of the Company, upon the
assessments of representatives of the Company regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to the Company or the mergers
(including the contemplated benefits thereof), as to which BofA Securities understood that the Company had obtained such advice as the Company
deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should
vote or act in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter.
BofA Securities’ opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the
information made available to BofA Securities as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its
opinion, and BofA Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities’ opinion was
approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities. Except as described above, the Company imposed no other limitations on the
investigations made or procedures followed by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion.
The discussion set forth above in the section entitled “—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” represents a brief summary of the material
financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to our board of directors in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the tables must be read together
with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities.
Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies
and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities.
Company Financial Analyses
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of the Company and
the following seven selected publicly traded companies with operations in the real estate industry (in the multifamily REIT sector) that BofA Securities
considered generally relevant. BofA Securities noted that none of these selected publicly traded companies in the multifamily sector are directly
comparable to the Company, which has operations in the student housing sector. The most directly comparable publicly traded company is Education
Reality Trust, Inc. (“EdR”), which was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on September 20, 2018 as part of the take private transaction by
Greystar Investment Group, LLC (“Greystar”).

number of their fully diluted shares outstanding, plus debt, preferred stock, non-controlling interests, and less cash and cash equivalents, as a multiple of
calendar year 2022 estimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization (“EBITDA”). Financial data of the selected publicly
traded companies were based on public filings and publicly available research analysts’ estimates as of April 14, 2022. Financial data of the Company
were based on the updated management financial projections.
BofA Securities also reviewed, among other things, per share equity values, based on closing stock prices on April 14, 2022 of the selected publicly
traded companies as a multiple of calendar year 2022 estimated funds from operations (referred to as “FFO”) per share. BofA Securities observed FFO-
Modified (“FFOM”), as provided by the Company’s management, which reflects certain adjustments related to the economic performance of the
Company’s on-campus participating properties and excludes other items, as the Company determined in good faith, that do not reflect the Company’s
core operations on a comparative basis. Financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on public filings and publicly available
research analysts’ estimates as of April 14, 2022. Financial data of the Company were based on the updated management financial projections.

The overall low to high calendar year 2022 estimated TEV / EBITDA multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 24.3x to 27.0x
(with a mean of 26.4x and a median of 26.1x).
The overall low to high calendar year 2022 estimated FFO per share multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 21.7x to 26.1x
(with a mean of 24.9x and a median of 25.6x).
BofA Securities then applied the selected range of calendar year 2022 TEV / EBITDA multiples of 21.0x to 25.0x, derived from the selected publicly traded
companies based on BofA Securities’ professional experience and judgment, to the Company’s calendar year 2022 estimated EBITDA of $474 million, as
set forth in the updated management financial projections, to calculate a range of implied enterprise values for the Company. Estimated financial data of
the Company were based on the updated management financial projections. BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges per
share of common stock by deducting estimated net debt of $3,416 million as of December 31, 2021, as provided by the Company’s management, from such
enterprise values and dividing the result by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding of 141.080 million as of March 31, 2022, based on information
provided by the Company’s management. In deriving the selected range of calendar year 2022 TEV / EBITDA multiples, BofA Securities took into
consideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected publicly traded companies and for the Company, the historical trading prices of the
Company’s common stock and the common stocks of the selected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial profiles of the Company
and the selected publicly traded companies.
Similarly, BofA Securities applied the selected range of calendar year 2022 estimated FFO per share multiples of 19.0x to 25.0x, derived from the selected
publicly traded companies based on BofA Securities’ professional experience and judgment, to the Company’s calendar year 2022 estimated FFOM of
$351 million and divided the result by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding of 141.080 million as of March 31, 2022,

based on information provided by the Company’s management. In deriving the selected range of calendar year 2022 FFO per share multiples, BofA
Securities took into consideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected publicly traded companies and for the Company, the historical
trading prices of the Company’s common stock and the common stocks of the selected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial
profiles of the Company and the selected publicly traded companies.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for the Company (rounded to the nearest $0.25), as
compared to the common stock consideration:

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to the Company. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which the Company was compared.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to the following
thirteen transactions, consisting of the Greystar EdR transaction announced on June 25, 2018 (the “selected transaction”), three transactions in the
student housing sector (referred to as “student housing transactions”), and nine transactions in the multifamily sector (referred to as “multifamily
transactions”).
Of the thirteen transactions, BofA Securities noted that, in its view, based on its professional experience and judgment, the only directly comparable
precedent transaction was the selected transaction. The operational and financial characteristics of EdR were most directly comparable to those of the
Company.

For the selected transaction and the other transactions, BofA Securities reviewed TEVs, calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target company
based on the consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company’s estimated next 12 months (“NTM”) EBITDA.
Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction,
and estimated financial data of the Company were based on the updated management financial projections.
The overall low to high TEV / NTM EBITDA multiples observed for all of the student housing and multifamily transactions (including the selected
transaction) were 18.7x to 26.6x. Based on its professional judgment and experience and after taking into consideration, among other things, the observed
data for the selected transaction, BofA Securities then applied a selected range of TEV / NTM EBITDA multiples of 20.4x to 24.4x. Utilizing the TEV
implied in the merger consideration and the Company’s estimated 2022 NTM EBITDA of $474 million, based on the updated management financial
projections, this analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for the Company (rounded to the nearest
$0.25), as compared to the common stock consideration:

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical to the Company or the mergers. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this
analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which
the Company and the mergers were compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company to calculate the estimated present value of
the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the Company was forecasted to generate during the Company’s fiscal year 2022 through fiscal
year 2027 based on the updated management financial projections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for the Company by applying a selected
range of terminal multiples of 20.0x to 24.0x, based on the historical trading range for the Company’s stock, to the Company’s terminal year estimated
EBITDA (at share) of $783 million, which was obtained by extrapolating the Company’s 2027 estimated EBITDA (at share) of $757 million at an assumed
growth rate of 3.5%, as provided by the Company’s management. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of
December 31, 2021 using a range of discount rates of 7.50% to 9.00%, reflecting an estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, which
was calculated by multiplying the estimated cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight, and then adding the products together.
The estimated cost of equity was obtained using the capital asset pricing model (which takes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the
applicable equity market risk premium) and the estimated cost of debt was based on the Company’s estimated borrowing cost. The number of fully-diluted
shares outstanding was 141.080 million as of March 31, 2022, based on information provided by the Company’s management. This analysis indicated the
following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for the Company (rounded to the nearest $0.25), as compared to the common stock
consideration:

Other Factors
BofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities’ material financial analyses with respect to its
opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:
•
historical trading prices and trading volumes of the common stock, which indicated low and high closing prices for the common stock
during the 52-week period ended April 14, 2022 of approximately $43.29 to $58.66 per share;
•
one-year future stock price targets for the common stock in publicly available research analyst reports, which indicated stock price targets
for the Company, of a range of approximately $57.74 to $65.00 per share;
•
research analysts’ estimates for the Company as reflected in selected publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ reports and other
publicly available information, which indicated, among other things, an overall low to high estimated net asset value per share range for the
Company of approximately $55.88 to $66.61 per share; and
•
estimated net asset value per share range for the Company, furnished by the Company’s management, of approximately $58.25 to $68.50 per
share.
Miscellaneous
As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled “—Company Financial Analyses” represents a brief summary of the material
financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to our board of directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all
analyses undertaken or factors considered by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex
analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA
Securities believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting
54
Table of Contents
portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or
the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and
opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater
weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of the Company. The estimates of the future performance of the Company in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested
by BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the common stock consideration and were provided to our board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The analyses
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or acquired or the prices at which any securities have
traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis
described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’ view of the actual value of the Company.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the mergers were determined through negotiations between the Company and Parent, rather than by
any financial advisor, and were approved by our board of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of our board of
directors. As described above, BofA Securities’ opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by our board of directors in its
evaluation of the mergers and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of our board of directors, management or any other party with respect
to the mergers or the common stock consideration.
The Company has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the mergers an aggregate fee that is currently estimated to be $56.34
million, approximately $3 million of which was payable upon the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent
upon the consummation of the mergers. The Company also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA
Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws. Pursuant to its engagement letter with
the Company, BofA Securities would be entitled to a transaction fee from the Company in connection with any merger or similar acquisition transaction,
irrespective of the identity of the acquirer. Such fee would generally be higher for a transaction that provides for greater merger consideration.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives trading,
foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and
investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,
governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of
customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or
other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company, Parent and certain of their respective
affiliates.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial
banking and other financial services to the Company and its affiliates and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of
these services, including having acted or acting as (i) financial advisor in connection with certain investment banking transactions and other corporate
activity, and (ii) sales agent, underwriter, manager and/or arranger on various debt and equity offerings and financings. From March 1, 2020 through
February 28, 2022, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from the Company of approximately $6.80 million as determined by BofA
Securities based on its books and records.
55
Table of Contents
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,
commercial banking treasury, lending and other financial services to Parent and certain of its affiliates and related companies and have received or in the
future may receive substantial compensation for the rendering of these services, including having acted or acting as (i) financial advisor in connection
with various acquisitions, divestures, purchases and sales of assets, and other corporate activity, (ii) underwriter, manager and/or arranger on various
debt and equity offerings and financings, and (iii) underwriter and manager in initial public offerings of certain affiliated or related companies. BofA
Securities has advised us that from March 1, 2020 through February 28, 2022, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Parent
and certain of its affiliates of approximately $662 million for investment and corporate banking and other financial services as determined by BofA
Securities based on its books and records.
Financing
In connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $9.2 billion to be paid to the holders of our common stock,
restricted stock, deferred stock awards and limited partnership units. Prior to the closing of the mergers, we expect to repay at maturity our $200 million
term loan. Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent expects to cause our outstanding indebtedness under our
revolving credit facility, if any, to be repaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans and senior unsecured notes to be repaid
or remain outstanding. As of March 31, 2022, we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $200 million in term loan financing
outstanding, approximately $535.4 million in mortgage loans and project-based taxable bonds outstanding (including a $330 million mortgage loan made to
wholly owned subsidiaries of a joint venture in which we own a 55% interest) and $2.8 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding.
Parent has informed us that it has received, in connection with the mergers, a debt commitment letter from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., providing for debt financing
through two balance sheet loans in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $2.1 billion and that it currently intends to pursue additional debt
financing in connection with the mergers. In addition, it is expected that the Sponsor, which is the operating partnership of BREIT, and its affiliates will
contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt
financing.
Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing may be
used for purposes such as reserves, paying carrying costs with respect to the properties, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and
expenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the debt
financing would be secured by, among other things, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or ground leased by us, certain
escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable collateral, and
that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings.
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the mergers. For more information, see “The
Merger Agreement—Financing Cooperation” and “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Mergers.”
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers
In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to approve the merger, the merger agreement and the other proposals described above, our
stockholders should be aware that our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of our stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to determine and declare the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, to be advisable and in our and our stockholders’ best interests to approve the
56
Table of Contents
execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to
recommend that the stockholders approve the merger. These interests are discussed below. For a description regarding compensation and benefits to be
provided to our employees generally following the merger effective time, see “The Merger Agreement—Employee Benefits.”
Treatment of Compensatory Awards
Our executive officers hold restricted stock and deferred stock awards, as further set forth in the section entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments
to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers.”
Restricted Stock. The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of restricted stock granted
pursuant to an incentive award plan, other than deferred stock awards, will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights
thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger
agreement and will have the right to receive the common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Deferred Stock Awards. The merger agreement provides that deferred stock awards will, as of immediately before the merger effective time, become vested
and no longer subject to restriction, and all deferred stock awards will, at the merger effective time, be adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to
have allocated to the holder’s account under the deferred compensation plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of
shares of common stock allocated to such account as of the merger effective time and (2) the merger consideration, and will no longer represent a right to
receive a number of shares of common stock or cash equal to or based on the value of a number of shares of common stock. Payments under our deferred
compensation plan will be made in accordance with the timing set forth in the plan and the applicable payment elections for participants in the plan,
subject to any right to terminate the plan and accelerate distributions of participant account balances pursuant to the terms of our deferred compensation
plan and applicable law.
Value of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would become payable to each of our named executive officers, see
“—Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” below. The estimated value of the payments
that will be made to our other executive officers, Messrs. de Cárdenas, Wilhelm and Winger and Ms. Ledbetter in respect of their outstanding restricted
stock and deferred stock awards at the merger effective time (or such later time in accordance with the deferred compensation plan) is $5,816,641 in the
aggregate, which is based on the number of outstanding unvested shares and awards held by these current executive officers as of June 14, 2022.
Treatment of Interests in the Partnership
Certain of our executive officers hold fully vested common partnership units as further set forth in the section entitled “—Quantification of Potential
Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers.” At the partnership merger effective time, each limited partnership unit, or
fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than excluded common partnership units)
will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock consideration, without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes. If we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, or to
avoid or reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the partnership unit
consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock.
Executive Severance Benefits
Arrangements. We are party to an employment agreement with each executive officer, which provides for the severance benefits described below upon a
severance-qualifying termination of employment. The severance benefits payable to each executive officer will be subject to compliance with the
restrictive covenants described below.
57
Table of Contents
Each employment agreement with an executive officer provides that the executive officer may terminate the agreement for “good reason,” which is defined
in the employment agreement, in general, as any substantial change by the Company in the nature or scope of the executive officer’s functions, duties,
responsibilities or reporting relationships without their express written consent, the requirement that the executive officer be based at a location at least
50 miles from their current principal location of employment, the Company’s failure to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume the
terms of the employment agreement and the Company’s breach of any material provision of the employment agreement.
The employment agreements with executive officers provide that, if the Company terminates an executive officer’s employment without “cause” or the
executive officer terminates employment for “good reason” (each as defined in the applicable employment agreement), the executive officer will be entitled
to accrued and unpaid obligations through the date of termination and the following payments and benefits:
•
A cash payment equal to 299% for Mr. Bayless and 100% for each other executive officer, in each case times the sum of their then-current
annual base salary plus the average annual cash bonus paid or payable in respect of the three years immediately prior to the year of
termination;
•
A prorated cash bonus for the year in which the termination occurs equal to the greater of (i) the annual cash bonus paid or payable in
respect to the year immediately prior to the year in which the termination occurs or (ii) the target cash bonus for the year in which the
termination occurs;
•
Health benefits for one year following the executive officer’s termination of employment at the same cost to the executive officer as in effect
immediately preceding such termination, subject to reduction to the extent that the executive officer receives comparable benefits from a
subsequent employer; and
•
All of the executive officer’s unvested shares of restricted stock and deferred stock awards will vest.
In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, if an executive officer’s employment with the Surviving Company is terminated after the merger effective
time and on or before December 31, 2022 by the Surviving Company without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, the executive officer will
be entitled to a pro-rata portion (based on the period of employment during 2022) of the cash value of the restricted stock award granted to such
executive officer in January 2022 (the “deferred cash award”) and if such termination of employment occurs on or after January 1, 2023, the executive
officer will be entitled to full vesting and payment of the deferred cash award, in each case, to the extent not otherwise payable pursuant to such
executive officer’s employment agreement and subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants described below and a release of claims in favor of the
Company and its subsidiaries and Parent.
Golden Parachute Excise Tax. Pursuant to the employment agreement with Mr. Bayless, if the payments or benefits made or provided to Mr. Bayless
under his employment agreement and under any other plan, program or agreement of the Company or its affiliates (the “Aggregate Payment’) are or
become subject to any tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code or any similar tax, the Company will pay to Mr. Bayless an additional amount such that
the net amount retained by Mr. Bayless with respect to the Aggregate Payment, after deduction of any excise tax on the Aggregate Payment and any
federal, state and local income tax and excise tax on such additional payment (and any interest and penalties thereon), but before deduction for any
federal, state or local income or employment tax withholding on such Aggregate Payment, shall be equal to the amount of the Aggregate Payment.
Restrictive Covenants. Any payments payable under the employment agreements are subject to the executive officer’s compliance with certain
confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and non-interference covenants that apply during the executive officer’s employment and for a period
ending on (i) the second anniversary of an executive officer’s termination of employment by the Company for cause or by executive officer without good
reason, or (ii) the first anniversary of the executive officer’s termination of employment by the Company other than for cause, by the executive officer with
good reason or by the executive officer for any reason at any time during the one-year period following a change in control.

Value of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would become payable to each of our
named executive officers upon a severance-qualifying termination, see “—Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Mergers” below. The estimated value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable upon a
severance-qualifying termination of employment on September 1, 2022 for our other executive officers, Messrs. de Cárdenas, Winger and Wilhelm and
Ms. Ledbetter, is $1,314,644, $1,126,043, $1,083,294 and $1,007,527, respectively.
Section 16(b) Exemption Resolution
Our board of directors believes that it is desirable that the Company’s directors and executive officers be relieved of the risk of liability under Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the exchange of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger.
Accordingly, our board of directors (or a committee thereof) intends to adopt a resolution providing that the disposition by the Company’s executive
officers and directors of our common stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the merger, are intended to be exempt from liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated thereunder.
Indemnification of Our Directors and Officers
The merger agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and after the merger effective time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the merger effective time, the Surviving Company will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to: (1) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each of our and our subsidiaries’ current or former managers, directors, officers and trustees (which persons we refer to as the “indemnified
parties”), against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, cause of action, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, mediation, interference, audit,
assessment, hearing or other legal proceeding (we refer to the foregoing as an “action”), arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such indemnified party’s capacity as a manager, director, officer or trustee of the Company or any of our subsidiaries arising out of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the merger effective time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the merger effective time),
including such alleged acts or omissions with respect to the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the mergers; and (2) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such action the expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and any
expenses incurred by any indemnified party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to indemnification) of any indemnified party without the
requirement of any bond or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by law, but subject to Parent’s or the Surviving Company’s receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of such indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnified party is not
entitled to be indemnified.
The parties have agreed not to terminate or modify the obligations described above regarding indemnification of the indemnified parties in such a manner
as to adversely affect such indemnified parties, and such obligations must be assumed by any successor entity to the Surviving Company as a result of
any consolidation, merger, dissolution or transfer of all or substantially all of its properties and assets.
The merger agreement also requires that, prior to the merger effective time, we will bind, effective at the merger effective time, extended coverage under
our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy by obtaining a prepaid six-year “tail” extended period on our existing officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance policies (or with insurers on terms and conditions no less favorable than such policies), which prepaid policies provide such persons currently
covered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the merger effective time, for an overall additional premium not to exceed 300% of the total annual premiums at the last renewal; provided, that we will
59
Table of Contents
reasonably cooperate and consult with Parent prior to the purchase of any such tail policy; provided, further, that if Parent can procure a “tail” policy on
superior terms or on equivalent terms, but at a lower price, as compared to any such policy that may be procured by us, then, subject to certain terms and
conditions, Parent may obtain such policy effective as of the merger effective time, in which case we shall not obtain such policy. Additionally, Parent and
the Surviving Company are required to maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about
certain compensation for each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. Solely for purposes of the table below,
it is assumed that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination immediately following the merger effective time. Such amounts
have been calculated assuming the merger effective time occurred on September 1, 2022. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments
described below, see the discussion under “—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” above.
The following table sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that may be paid or become payable to each of the named executive officers in
connection with the mergers pursuant to all applicable compensation plans or agreements, assuming that the merger effective time occurred on September
1, 2022 and that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination immediately following the merger effective time. The calculations
in the table do not include amounts that named executive officers were vested in as of the date of this proxy statement and do not reflect any shares of
common stock or vested deferred stock awards held by the named executive officers.

Cash severance consists of the following components, all of which are “double-trigger” benefits contingent upon the occurrence of a termination
of the named executive officer’s employment without cause or the named executive officer’s resignation for good reason following the merger
effective time:
(a)
A cash payment equal to 299% for Mr. Bayless and 100% for Messrs. Talbot and Perry and Mses. Beese and Voss, in each case times the
sum of his or her then-current annual base salary plus the average annual cash bonus paid or payable in respect of the three years
immediately prior to the year of termination;
(b)
A prorated cash bonus for the year in which the termination occurs equal to the greater of (i) the annual cash bonus paid or payable in
respect to the year immediately prior to the year in which the termination occurs or (ii) the target cash bonus for the year in which the
termination occurs; and

(c)
As provided in the merger agreement, a prorated amount of a deferred cash award equal to the cash value of the restricted stock award
granted to such executive officer in January 2022 that each named executive officer is eligible to receive in 2023.
The amounts set forth in the table below are estimates of the prorated amount of the cash severance, prorated cash bonus and the prorated
deferred cash award each named executive officer will receive:

The amounts set forth in the tables above are based on compensation levels as of March 1, 2022 and assume that there are no bonus amounts
which have been earned but not yet paid to the named executive officer prior to the date of the named executive officer’s termination. For further
details regarding the cash severance, see “—Executive Severance Benefits” above.

For all named executive officers, the treatment of compensatory awards at the merger effective time is a “single-trigger” benefit contingent upon the
occurrence of the mergers. The amounts set forth in the table above and the table below are estimates of the value each named executive officer will
receive in respect of his or her outstanding compensatory awards. These estimates assume that all shares of restricted stock and unvested deferred
stock awards held by each named executive officer as of June 14, 2022, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this filing, remain outstanding
as of the merger effective time and each named executive officer does not receive any additional compensatory awards between such date and the
merger effective time and disregards any vesting of compensatory awards that may occur prior to the merger effective time.

Each named executive officer is entitled to receive health benefits for one year following the named executive officer’s termination of employment at
the same cost to the named executive officer as in effect immediately preceding such termination, subject to reduction to the extent that the named
executive officer receives comparable benefits from a subsequent employer. The value of the perquisites/benefits reported in this column assume
that such coverage continues for the full one-year period. These benefits are “double-trigger” benefits contingent upon the occurrence of a
termination of the named executive officer’s employment without cause or the named executive officer’s resignation for good reason following the
merger effective time, or for any reason within one year after the merger effective time. For further details regarding the perquisites and benefits, see
“—Executive Severance Benefits” above.
(4)
As described in the section entitled “—Executive Severance Payments—Golden Parachute Payments,” the employment agreement with Mr. Bayless
provides for payments to Mr. Bayles to compensate for any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar payment. No such
payments are currently anticipated based on the assumptions set forth above.

Regulatory Matters
We are unaware of any material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required for the execution of the merger agreement
or the completion of the merger or the partnership merger, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger with respect to the merger and the
partnership merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, and the filing of the certificate of merger with respect to the
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
Litigation Related to the Mergers
Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement, plaintiffs filed three separate lawsuits related to the proxy statement. One suit, styled Cody
Charfauros v. American Campus Communities, et al., No. 1:22-cv-04075, which we refer to as the “Charfauros Lawsuit” was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. A second suit, styled as Shiva Stein v. American Campus Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-
03829-JGK, which we refer to as the “Stein Lawsuit,” was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. A third suit,
styled as Samuel Acuna v. American Campus Communities, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-03254, which we refer to as the “Acuna Lawsuit,” was filed in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
The Charfauros Lawsuit names as defendants the Company, the Company’s directors and a former director of the Company who ceased to serve as such
in 2015 upon his death. The Charfauros Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including the rights,
authorities and powers of the special committee, the confidentiality agreements with Blackstone and other counterparties, potential conflicts of interest
involving certain directors and officers of the Company, the value of Company options, restricted stock units, and other equity awards that the
Company’s directors and officers will receive in the proposed mergers, details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company’s
officers and directors, certain financial projections and metrics, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial
metrics to GAAP metrics, and input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities’ analysis. Relying on those allegations, the Charfauros Lawsuit
asserts, on behalf of an individual plaintiff, a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a “control person” claim
under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violations against the members of our board of directors. The Charfauros
Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers, rescission of the mergers if the mergers are consummated, the
dissemination of a revised preliminary proxy statement, an award of damages if the mergers are consummated and an award of plaintiff’s costs, including
attorneys’ fees.
The Stein Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company’s directors. Like the Charfauros Lawsuit, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a claim
under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of
directors. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, financial
metrics, input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities’ analysis, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics. The Stein
Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers unless and until defendants disclose the material information alleged to
have been omitted from the proxy statement, rescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are consummated, an award of damages and
an award of plaintiff’s costs, including attorneys’ fees.
The Acuna Lawsuit, like the Charfauros Lawsuit and the Stein Lawsuit, names as defendants the Company and the Company’s directors and asserts a
claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our
board of directors. The Acuna Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections
(including line items underlying the projections, net income projections and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics), input data
and assumptions used in BofA Securities’ analysis, potential conflicts of interest involving KeyBank Capital Markets Inc. and potential conflicts of
interest involving certain directors and officers of the Company. The Acuna Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed
mergers, rescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are
62
Table of Contents
consummated, a declaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and an award
of plaintiff’s costs, including attorneys’ fees.
The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the mergers from becoming effective in a timely manner.
Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit and
intends to defend against these actions vigorously.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each, as
defined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of
the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”), each, as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may change at any time, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.
No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described
below. We have not sought and will not seek an advance ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this section. This summary assumes that
the merger will be consummated in accordance with the merger agreement and as described in this proxy statement.
This discussion is not a complete description of all tax consequences of the merger and, in particular, does not address any tax consequences arising
under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, any withholding
considerations pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance thereunder
and the intergovernmental agreements entered into, and laws and regulations promulgated, pursuant thereto or in connection therewith) nor does it
address any tax considerations under state, local or non-U.S. laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
•
a trust (1) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more “United States
persons” (as defined under the Code) who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) that has a valid election
in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an
entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders of shares of common stock who hold such shares as “capital assets” within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion is for general information purposes only and does
not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular facts
63
Table of Contents
and circumstances, and it does not apply to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example:
•
insurance companies;
•
dealers, brokers or traders in securities or currencies;
•
traders in securities who elect to apply the mark-to-market method of accounting;
•
broker-dealers;
•
persons acting as nominees or otherwise not as beneficial owners;
•
holders subject to the alternative minimum tax;
•
persons who are required to recognize income or gain no later than such income or gain is required to be reported on an applicable financial
statement;
•
U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;
•
tax-exempt entities and organizations;
•
retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred or advantaged accounts (or persons holding shares of common stock
through such plans or accounts);
•
banks and other financial institutions;
•
certain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States;
•
controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies;
•
partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other flow-through entities
(and investors therein);
•
S corporations;
•
REITs;
•
regulated investment companies;
•
holders who own or have owned at any time, or are deemed to own or to have owned at any time, directly, indirectly or constructively, at
least 5% or more, by voting power or value, of our stock;
•
“qualified foreign pension funds” (within the meaning of Section 897(1)(2) of the Code) or entities all of the interests in which are held by a
qualified pension fund;
•
“qualified shareholders” (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or investors therein;
•
non-U.S. holders who hold, or have held at any time, directly, indirectly, or constructively, more than 10% of our outstanding shares of
common stock;
•
holders who hold shares of common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated or risk reduction
transaction; or
•
holders who acquired shares of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards, through a tax-
qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation.
If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of common stock, the tax
treatment of a partner in that partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or
partnership is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of the merger to it in light of its
particular circumstances.

DETERMINING THE ACTUAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO A HOLDER MAY BE COMPLEX AND WILL DEPEND ON A
HOLDER’S SPECIFIC SITUATION. ALL HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT
TO THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX LAWS AND ANY POTENTIAL
CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.
Tax Classification of the Merger in General
It is expected the merger will be treated as (1) the adoption by the Company of a plan of liquidation, and (2) a sale by the Company of all of its assets to
Merger Sub I (or, if applicable, its regarded owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in exchange for the common stock consideration to be provided to
the holders of equity interests in the Company and the assumption of all of the Company’s liabilities, and any other applicable amounts, followed by a
distribution of such common stock consideration, and any other applicable amounts, to the holders of equity interests in the Company in liquidation of
the Company pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code. As a REIT, the Company is generally entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating
distributions, and we anticipate that our deemed liquidating distribution will exceed our taxable income recognized as a result of the merger (together with
any other undistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the merger). Accordingly, we anticipate that we will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on any gain that we recognize in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The remainder of this discussion assumes that the merger will be treated as described above.
Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete
liquidation of the Company and a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of shares of common stock will
recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received
with respect to such U.S. holder’s shares of common stock in the merger, and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of common stock.
If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of common stock at different times and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted
tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares of common stock. Any such gain or loss will generally be capital
gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger is greater
than one year at the time of the merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for reduced
rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
A U.S. holder who has held shares of common stock for less than six months at the time of the merger, taking into account the holding period rules of
Sections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss on the exchange of such shares of common stock in the merger, will be treated as
recognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received from us, or such holder’s share of any designated retained capital
gains, with respect to such shares.
Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock
General. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of payments made with respect to such non-U.S. holder’s shares of common
stock in connection with the merger will depend on various factors,
65

including whether the receipt of such payments is treated as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs pursuant
to the provisions of FIRPTA. The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it intends to take the position that under current law a non-U.S. holder’s receipt
of a liquidating distribution from a REIT (including payments made in connection with the merger, which as noted, are expected to be treated as
distributions in complete liquidation of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is generally subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to
the extent attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs. Although legislation effectively overriding Notice 2007-55 has previously been proposed, it is not
possible to say if or when any such legislation will be enacted. Accordingly, we intend to take the position that payments made with respect the
Company’s shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be subject to tax in accordance with Notice 2007-55, subject to the 10% Exception, as
described in more detail below. In general, the provisions governing the taxation of distributions by REITs can be less favorable to non-U.S. holders than
the taxation of sales or exchanges of REIT stock by non-U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of
these provisions.
Distribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests. To the extent that the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and the
10% Exception described in the next paragraph below does not apply, then, to the extent that payments received by a non-U.S. holder with respect to
such non-U.S. holder’s common stock pursuant to the merger are treated as attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of our USRPIs, such
amounts will be treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder, and generally will be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis. A corporate non-U.S. holder will also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be
specified by an applicable income tax treaty). In addition, 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in the Treasury Regulations) of any such amounts paid to a
non-U.S. holder will be withheld and remitted to the IRS.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of our common stock are considered “regularly traded” (within the meaning of the applicable Treasury
Regulations) on an established securities market located in the United States and the non-U.S. holder did not hold more than 10% of such class of stock
at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the merger, the tax treatment and consequences described above would not apply (the “10%
Exception”), and non-U.S. holders would instead be subject to the rules described below under “—Taxable Sale of Common Stock.” We believe that
shares of our common stock are, and will be at the time of the merger, considered regularly traded on an established securities market located in the
United States within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding tax consequences
of the merger to them.
Taxable Sale of Common Stock. If both (A) the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 were not to apply to a non-U.S. holder’s receipt of payments with
respect to such non-U.S. holder’s shares of common stock pursuant to the merger and (B) either (1) the “publicly traded exception” (as described below)
applies or (2) we are a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” (as described below), such that the Company’s shares of common stock do
not constitute USRPIs under FIRPTA with respect to such non-U.S. holder, then the non-U.S. holder should not be subject to tax on any gain recognized
in connection with the receipt of cash consideration payable pursuant to the merger (which, as described above under “—Consequences of the Merger
to U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock” and subject to the discussion of Notice 2007-55 above, is generally expected to be treated as a distribution
in complete liquidation of the Company and as amounts received in full payment in exchange for such holder’s shares of common stock) unless: (a) the
gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if required pursuant to an applicable
income tax treaty, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States; or (b) the non-U.S. holder
is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other requirements are met.
The “publicly traded exception” applies to a non-U.S. holder if our common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by the applicable Treasury
Regulations, and the non-U.S. holder has held 10% or less of the shares of common stock at all times during the shorter of the period that the non-U.S.
holder owned such stock or the
66
Table of Contents
five-year period ending on the date of the merger. We believe that shares of our common stock are, and will be at the time of the merger, considered
regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations.
We will be a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the time of the merger if non-U.S. holders held directly or indirectly less than 50% in
value of shares of our stock at all times during the five-year period ending with the merger. While we believe that the Company has been and currently is
domestically controlled as of the date hereof, no assurances can be given that the actual ownership of shares of our stock has been or will be sufficient
for us to qualify as a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the time of the merger.
A non-U.S. holder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or, if an applicable income tax treaty
requires, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) will generally be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be subject to the
branch profits tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described
above.
A non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and who meets certain other
requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain recognized in connection with the merger, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital
losses of the non-U.S. holder.
If a non-U.S. holder’s shares of common stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by such holder on a sale of such stock will be
treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and, in the case of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation, the branch profits tax as
described above).
Income Tax Treaties. If a non-U.S. holder is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States, the non-U.S. holder may be able
to reduce or eliminate certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above, such as the branch profits tax. Non-U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisor regarding possible benefits under an applicable income tax treaty.
U.S. Withholding Tax. As described above, it is not entirely clear whether the receipt of payments pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder will be
treated as a sale or exchange of shares of common stock (if Notice 2007-55 does not apply) or as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to
gain from the deemed sale of the Company’s USRPIs in the merger (if Notice 2007-55 does apply and the holder does not qualify for the 10% Exception
described above). Accordingly, we intend to withhold, pursuant to FIRPTA, U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in
applicable Treasury Regulations) from the portion of the consideration paid to a non-U.S. holder to the extent attributable to gains that the Company
recognizes from sales of USRPIs, unless such non-U.S. holder qualifies for the 10% Exception described above. A non-U.S. holder may be entitled to a
refund or credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, with respect to any amount withheld pursuant to FIRPTA; provided that the
required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisor regarding withholding tax considerations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to payments made in connection with the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however,
to a holder of shares of common stock who (1) in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that such holder is
not subject to backup withholding on an IRS Form W-9, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; (2) in
the case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes an applicable IRS Form W-8; or (3) provides
67
Table of Contents
proof that such holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with other applicable rules and certification requirements. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability, if any, so long as such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.
THIS DISCUSSION OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY
AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX
LAWS.

Common Stock
The merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of common stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than excluded common stock) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded common stock will be automatically retired
and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the merger. If we declare or pay a
dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid or reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes
under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the common stock consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per
share amount of such dividend on the common stock.
Restricted Stock
The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of restricted stock granted pursuant to the
Company’s incentive award plans, other than deferred stock awards, will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights
thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger
agreement and will have the right to receive the common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Deferred Stock Awards
The merger agreement provides that all deferred stock awards will, as of immediately before the merger effective time, become vested and no longer
subject to restriction, and all deferred stock awards will, at the merger effective time, be adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to have allocated
to the holder’s account under the deferred compensation plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of
common stock allocated to such account as of the merger effective time and (2) the merger consideration, and will no longer represent a right to receive a
number of shares of common stock. Payments under our deferred compensation plan will be made in accordance with the timing set forth in the plan and
the applicable payment elections for participants in the plan, subject to any right to terminate the plan and accelerate distributions of participant account
balances pursuant to the terms of our deferred compensation plan and applicable law.

The merger agreement provides that, at the partnership merger effective time, each partnership unit, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than excluded partnership units) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the partnership unit consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Common partnership units, general
partnership interests in the Partnership, and preferred partnership units, in each case, held by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company will be unaffected by the partnership merger and will remain outstanding as partnership units of the Surviving Partnership held by the
Company or the relevant wholly owned subsidiary. Common partnership units and preferred partnership units held by the Parent Parties or any of their
respective wholly owned subsidiaries will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in

At or prior to the partnership merger effective time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a paying agent reasonably acceptable to us, a cash
amount that, when taken together with available cash of the Company and its subsidiaries that is deposited with the paying agent at the partnership
merger effective time, is sufficient in the aggregate to enable the paying agent to make the payments of the applicable merger consideration to holders of
common stock and holders of partnership units, as applicable, outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time and the partnership merger
effective time, as applicable, less the applicable merger consideration to be paid in respect of the compensatory awards, which amounts will be delivered
directly to the Surviving Company. At the merger effective time, Parent will deposit with the Surviving Company cash in the amount necessary, together
with the other funds of the Surviving Company, to make the payments to holders of the compensatory awards, including the common stock consideration
and all accrued and unpaid cash dividends, as applicable, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to make such payments through the Surviving
Company’s payroll as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five business days after the merger effective time, or at such later time as
necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code or comply with the terms of the deferred compensation
plan.
Within five business days after the merger effective time, the paying agent will in accordance with, and as required by the paying agent’s customary
procedures, (1) mail to each holder of record of book-entry shares that, (a) immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time, represented
outstanding partnership units and (b) immediately prior to the merger effective time, represented shares of common stock, which were converted into the
right to receive the partnership unit consideration and the common stock consideration, as applicable (and including, as applicable, the compensatory
awards), an instruction request letter, including instructions for effecting the exchange of book-entry shares for the applicable merger consideration and
(2) subject to the requirements set forth in the merger agreement, make delivery and disbursement of the applicable merger consideration out of the
exchange fund to the holders of such book-entry shares upon surrender to the paying agent of such book-entry shares, in each case, other than to the
holders of compensatory awards and less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
The exchange of book-entry shares representing common stock and partnership units, as applicable, will be effected in accordance with the paying
agent’s customary procedures with respect to book-entry securities.
On or after the first anniversary of the merger effective time, the Surviving Company will be entitled to cause the paying agent to deliver to the Surviving
Company any funds made available by Parent to the paying agent which have not been disbursed to holders of book-entry shares, and thereafter such
holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Company with respect to the cash amounts payable upon surrender of their book-entry shares. None of
Parent, the Surviving Entities or the paying agent or any other person will be liable to any holder of common stock or partnership units, as applicable, for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by
72Table of Contents
holders of common stock or partnership units, as applicable, immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
the property of, any governmental authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.
As of the merger effective time and the partnership merger effective time, as applicable, the stock or unit transfer books of the Company and the
Partnership, respectively, will be closed, and thereafter, there will be no further registration of transfers of any of the common stock or partnership units.
If, after the merger effective time or the partnership merger effective time, book-entry shares representing common stock or partnership units, as
applicable, are presented to the paying agent or the Surviving Entities for transfer, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in the merger
agreement.
Each of the Company, the Partnership, the Parent Parties, the Surviving Entities and the paying agent (and any affiliates or designees of the foregoing)
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the applicable merger consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the merger
agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld will be paid over to the applicable governmental authority in accordance with applicable law
and will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the stockholder approval (provided that the record date is not more than 90 days prior to the date of the special

We are required to, through our board of directors, recommend to holders of our common stock that they vote in favor of the merger proposal so that we
may obtain the stockholder approval of the merger proposal, include such recommendation of our board of directors in this proxy statement and solicit
and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the stockholder approval of the merger proposal by our common stockholders, except to the extent that
our board of directors has effected an adverse recommendation change, as permitted by and determined in accordance with the provisions described
below under the section entitled “—Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation.” Without the prior written consent of
Parent, (1) the approval of the merger will be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable law to be voted on by
our stockholders in connection with the merger agreement or the approval of the merger) that we will propose to be acted on by our stockholders at the
special meeting and (2) we will not submit to the vote of our stockholders any competing proposal. We will cooperate with and keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis regarding our solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the proxy statement to our
stockholders. Unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, our obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
special meeting will not be affected by an adverse recommendation change.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, after consultation with Parent, we may adjourn or postpone the special
meeting, if, on the date for which the special meeting is scheduled, we have not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of common
stock to obtain the stockholder approval, whether or not a quorum is present, to the extent required by applicable law to provide any required disclosure
to our stockholders or to the extent necessary to solicit additional proxies; provided, that, without the prior written consent of Parent, the special meeting

interests or equity interests of Holdings;

•
taking all actions necessary to cause the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied;

any governmental authority in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement

possible; and
•
executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the mergers and the other transactions

take any actions that would limit the freedom of such party, its subsidiaries or their affiliates with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their
businesses, product lines or assets.
Nothing in the merger agreement requires Parent or any affiliates of Parent, including Blackstone, to agree or otherwise be required to take any action,
including any action with respect to any affiliates of Parent (including Blackstone, any investment funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or
managed or advised by, Blackstone or its affiliates, or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) or
investment of Blackstone or of any such investment fund or investment vehicle), or any interest therein (in each case other than with respect to the
Parent Parties and their subsidiaries (including, following the closing, the Surviving Entities and their subsidiaries)).

governmental authority in connection with the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except that confidential
competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchange. To the extent reasonably practicable, no party will, nor will it permit its
representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any governmental authority in respect of

merger agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent, we, our subsidiaries and our representatives will not, and no party nor any of their
subsidiaries or representatives will be obligated to, pay or commit to pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such person. Subject to the immediately foregoing
sentence, the parties will cooperate with respect to reasonable accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.
We and our representatives will give prompt notice to the Parent Parties and the Parent Parties and their respective representative will give prompt notice
to us of any notice or other communication received by such party from any governmental authority in connection with the merger agreement, the
mergers or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
required in connection with the merger agreement, the mergers or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
We will give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties will give prompt notice to us, if (1) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in the merger agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to expect that the applicable closing conditions would
reasonably be expected to be incapable of being satisfied by October 18, 2022 or (2) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under the merger agreement; provided, that no such notification will affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under the merger agreement or any
remedies for any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under the merger agreement.
We and our representatives will give prompt notice to the Parent Parties and the Parent Parties and their respective representative will give prompt notice
to us of any action, lawsuit or other legal proceeding relating to the merger agreement, the mergers or the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and which is ongoing or to the informing parties’ knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving it, its subsidiaries or their respective
directors, officers, or partners, and to keep the other parties informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof (including by
promptly furnishing to the other parties such information relating to such action, lawsuit or other legal proceeding as may be reasonably requested,
subject to the preservation of privilege). We and our representatives will give Parent the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any such action, lawsuit or other legal proceeding against us, our subsidiaries or our or their directors, officers or partners relating to the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, will give due consideration to Parent’s advice with respect to such action,
lawsuit or other legal proceeding and no such settlement will be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

From and after the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the closing or the date on which the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, we have agreed that, except as permitted by certain exceptions described below, we will, and will cause each of our subsidiaries and our and
their directors and officers to, and will direct our other representatives to immediately cease any activities, solicitation, encouragement, discussions or
negotiations with any person with respect to any competing proposal or inquiry (as described below).
We have further agreed that, except as permitted by certain exceptions described below, we will not, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage, provide any non-public information to, or take any other action for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry;

•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person information in
connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry;
•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or other

lead to a competing proposal or requiring us to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (any such contract, an “alternative acquisition agreement”); or
•
resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
At any time prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, we may, directly or indirectly through one or more of our representatives, (1) participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish information (including non-public information) relating to us and our subsidiaries or (2) afford access
to our and our subsidiaries’ business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, in each case, pursuant to
an acceptable confidentiality agreement, to, any person or group of persons that has made, renewed or delivered to us a bona fide written competing
proposal after the date of the merger agreement and prior to obtaining the stockholder approval (that did not result from a breach of our obligations
described under this section “—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals” and in the section entitled “—Obligation of Our Board of Directors with
Respect to Its Recommendation”) or to such person’s representatives; provided, that:
•
our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such competing
proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal; and
•
we will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if we take any such actions and, subject to applicable law, any
non-public information concerning us or our subsidiaries that is provided to such person or its representatives that was not previously
provided to Parent or its representatives will be provided or made available to Parent promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) following
such time as it is provided or made available to such person.
If we receive a competing proposal or inquiry, we will:
•
promptly (and in any event no later than 24 hours) after receipt of such competing proposal or inquiry, advise Parent in writing of the receipt
of such competing proposal or inquiry, the identity of the person or group making such competing proposal or inquiry and the material
terms and conditions thereof, and provide to Parent copies of any such competing proposal or inquiry made in writing and any written
documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and correspondence relating thereto); and
•
keep Parent advised, on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours), of all material developments, discussions or
negotiations regarding any competing proposal or inquiry and the status of such competing proposal or inquiry, including notifying Parent
of any change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of any competing proposal or inquiry and providing Parent copies of
any written documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and correspondence relating thereto, except that we may redact the
documentation and terms and conditions of any such competing proposal or inquiry, to the extent we determine in good faith, after
consultation with our outside legal counsel, that such redactions are required by existing contractual obligations to protect confidential
information of the business or operations of the person making such competing proposal or inquiry.
Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may, after the date of the merger agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit
us from providing any information required to be provided to Parent in accordance with the merger agreement.

For purposes of the merger agreement, “inquiry” means any inquiry, indication of interest or request for information or discussions from any person or
group that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a competing proposal.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means a written competing proposal made by any “person or group” (as such term is defined
in the Exchange Act) (except for purposes of this definition, the references in the definition of “competing proposal” to 15% will be replaced with 50%)
that our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into
consideration (1) all of the terms and conditions of the competing proposal and the merger agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent)
and (2) the feasibility and certainty of consummation of such competing proposal on the terms proposed (taking into account all legal, financial,
financing, regulatory approvals, conditionality, breakup fee provisions and other aspects of such competing proposal and conditions to consummation
thereof that our board of directors deems relevant)) would result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to
the holders of common stock (solely in their capacities as stockholders) than the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent) and is reasonably likely to be consummated.
In addition, the merger agreement provides that we may not, nor may we permit any of our subsidiaries to, release any person from, or waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill or confidentiality provision with respect to a competing proposal or inquiry or similar
matter in any contract to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party; provided, that, if our board of directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the duties of our board
of directors under applicable law, we may grant a limited waiver of any standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit any person to make a
non-public competing proposal to our board of directors and, to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, thereafter negotiate and enter into any
transaction in connection therewith. The merger agreement also provides that neither we nor our board of directors will take any action to exempt any
person (other than any Parent Party or their affiliates) from or render inapplicable the “Ownership Limit” (as defined in our charter) (including by
establishing or increasing an excepted holder limit under our charter), or any takeover statute, in each case, unless such actions are taken concurrently
with the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with the provisions described in the second bullet point in the section entitled “—
Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by the Company.”

Except in the circumstances and pursuant to the procedures described below, neither our board of directors nor any committee thereof will:
•
fail to recommend to our stockholders that the stockholder approval be given or fail to include in this proxy statement its recommendation
that our common stockholders approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
•
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, its recommendation
that our common stockholders approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

•
authorize, cause or permit us or any of our subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.

We refer to any action in the first four bullets above as an “adverse recommendation change.”
Prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, if (1) we have not breached our obligations described in the section entitled “—No Solicitation” in any
material respect and also have not breached our obligations described under this section “—Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its
Recommendation” in any respect and (2) we receive an unsolicited bona fide written competing proposal that did not result from a breach of our
obligations described in the section entitled “—No Solicitation” or under this section “—Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its
Recommendation,” and our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a superior proposal, then our board of directors is permitted to make an adverse recommendation change and/or terminate the merger
agreement in accordance with its terms in order to substantially concurrently enter into an alternative acquisition agreement providing for the
implementation of such competing proposal (as described in the second bullet in the section entitled “—Termination of the Merger Agreement—
Termination by the Company”), if and only if:
•
our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel), that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law;
•
we have given Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice of our intention to take such actions (which notice will include the
identity of the person or group making such competing proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof, as well as copies of any
written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements providing for such superior proposal);
•
during the three business day period following Parent’s receipt of such notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such third
business day (which we refer to as the “match period”), we have negotiated, and caused our representatives to negotiate, with Parent and
its representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to propose in writing revisions to the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement so that our board of directors would no longer determine that such competing proposal constitutes
a superior proposal or the failure to make an adverse recommendation change and/or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement in
response to such superior proposal would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law; and
•
at the end of the match period, our board of directors has considered any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing
by Parent and has determined in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the competing
proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a superior proposal and that the failure to make an adverse recommendation change
and/or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement in response to such superior proposal would continue to be inconsistent with the
duties of our board of directors under applicable law, in each case, if the revisions proposed by Parent were given effect; provided, that, in
the event of any change to the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material
terms of such superior proposal, we will, in each case, be required to deliver to Parent an additional written notice consistent with that
described in the second bullet above and the match period will recommence (provided that any such new match period will be a period of
two business days following receipt by Parent of any such additional notice) and we will be required to comply with the bullet immediately
above and this bullet anew.
Prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, our board of directors may effect an adverse recommendation change, other than in connection with a
superior proposal, in response to an intervening event if:
•
our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect an adverse recommendation change would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law;
•
we have provided prior written notice to Parent at least four business days in advance to the effect that our board of directors has so
determined and resolved to effect such adverse recommendation change,
87
Table of Contents
which notice will specify and describe the facts and circumstances relating to the applicable intervening event in reasonable detail and the
factual bases for our board of directors’ determination that such events or circumstances constitute an intervening event;
•
prior to effecting such an adverse recommendation change, we and our representations have negotiated with Parent and its representatives
in good faith during the four-business day period following Parent’s receipt of such notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on
such fourth business day (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to allow Parent to propose such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement to obviate the need to effect an adverse recommendation change in response to such intervening event;
and
•
at the end of such four business day period, our board of directors determines (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside
legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement) in good faith that
the failure to make an adverse recommendation change in response to such intervening event would continue to be inconsistent with the
duties of our board of directors under applicable law if the revisions proposed by Parent were given effect.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “intervening event” means a change in circumstances or development occurring or arising after the date of the
merger agreement that materially affects the business, assets or operations of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that was not known to or
reasonably foreseeable (or, if known, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) by our board of directors prior to
the execution of the merger agreement, which change in circumstances or development becomes known to our board of directors prior to the receipt of
the stockholder approval; provided, however, that none of the following will constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been an
intervening event:
•
the receipt, existence or terms of any competing proposal, any inquiry or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof;
•
the fact that, in and of itself, we meet or exceed any internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other
financial or operating metrics for any period (provided, however, that the underlying causes of such change will not be excluded by this
bullet);
•
changes in the market price or trading volume of shares of our common stock (provided, however, that the underlying causes of such
change will not be excluded by this bullet); or
•
any event, change, effect, development or occurrence that would fall within any of the exceptions to the definition of a “material adverse
effect.”
Nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits us, our board of directors or our representatives from:
•
taking and disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any “stop, look
and listen” communication to our stockholders pending disclosure of our position thereunder; provided, that any such disclosure does not
contain an adverse recommendation change;
•
disclosing to our stockholders any factual information regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations or the fact that a
competing proposal has been made, the identity of the person making such competing proposal or the material terms of such competing
proposal, in each case, that our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our outside legal counsel) that such
disclosure is required under applicable law, and disclosure under this bullet will not limit or otherwise affect our or our board of directors’
obligations (or the obligations of any committee thereof) under the merger agreement and no such disclosure will, taken by itself, be deemed
to be an adverse recommendation change; or

terms of the merger agreement, and (2) any statement or disclosure made by us or our board of directors (or a committee thereof) pursuant to the
preceding three bullets must be subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit us

From and after the merger effective time and for a period of not less than 12 months after the closing date, solely during any period of employment, Parent
will, or will cause the Surviving Entities to, provide to each of our and our subsidiaries’ employees who continues employment with Parent, us or our
subsidiaries following the merger effective time (each, a “continuing employee”) with (1) a base salary that is no less than the base salary as provided to
such continuing employee immediately prior to the merger effective time, (2) paid-time off, qualified defined contribution retirement and health insurance
benefits that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, than as provided to each such continuing employee immediately prior to the merger effective time,
and (3) severance benefits as agreed by us and Parent, which benefits are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided to each such
continuing employee immediately prior to the merger effective time. In addition, for each continuing employee who remains employed by Parent, us or our
subsidiaries on December 31, 2022, subject to certain exclusions as provided in the merger agreement, (A) such continuing employee will be eligible to
receive (x) an annual cash bonus with respect to fiscal 2022 no less than the annual cash bonus paid to such continuing employee with respect to fiscal
2021 and (y) a “deferred cash award” with a value no less than the grant date value of the restricted stock award granted to such employee with respect

subsidiaries provide such past service credit) under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving Entities, as
applicable, in which such employees became participants; provided, however, that the foregoing will not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. As of the merger effective time, Parent will, or
will cause the Surviving Entities to, credit to continuing employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any of our or our
subsidiaries’ applicable benefit plans as of the merger effective time.
With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entities for the benefit of continuing employees, Parent will (1)
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of
any preexisting condition limitations under such plan, and (2) cause each continuing employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by
such continuing employee under any similar benefit plan for the plan year that includes the merger effective time for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained
by Parent or the Surviving Entities, as applicable, for the plan year in which the merger effective time occurs.

The Parent Parties have agreed that they and their affiliates will not, without our prior written consent, enter into any agreement, arrangement or any other
understanding, whether written or oral, with any potential source of debt financing that would reasonably be expected to limit, restrict, restrain, otherwise
impair in any manner, directly or indirectly, the ability of such source of debt financing to provide debt financing or other assistance to any other party in
any other transaction involving us or our subsidiaries (provided that this will not prohibit the establishment of customary “tree” arrangements).
At our request, Parent will keep us reasonably informed in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the debt financing.

Promptly upon the request of Parent, we and the Partnership will or will cause our subsidiaries to (to the extent applicable) and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause our minority joint ventures to, deliver to each of the lenders or any agent or trustee acting on their behalf (each, an “existing
lender”) under certain indebtedness identified by Parent (the “assumed indebtedness”), a notice prepared by Parent, in form and substance reasonably
approved by us, requesting that such existing lender deliver to Parent and us or our applicable subsidiary a written statement and documents (the
“assumption documents”) (A) confirming (1) the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness outstanding under such assumed indebtedness, (2) the
date to which interest and principal has been paid in respect of such assumed indebtedness, and (3) the amount of any escrows being held by such
existing lender in respect of such assumed indebtedness; and (B) consenting to the assumption of the existing indebtedness, the replacement of any
guaranty and the consummation of the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to the modifications of the terms
of such assumed indebtedness that Parent may reasonably request after the date hereof; provided that we will be informed of any such request or
modification.

the title insurance policy previously issued to the existing lenders, servicing fees, rating agency fees, assignment and assumption fees, attorneys’ fees
and disbursements and processing fees required to be paid to the existing lenders as a condition to issuance of the assumption documents. None of us or

consequences to any of our stockholders or other equity interest holders (in such person’s capacity as a stockholder or other equity interest holder), that

party in connection with the consummation of the merger agreement in the absence of such action taken, and (6) we and our subsidiaries will not be
required to provide any material non-public information to a third party other than Parent and its affiliates or their respective representatives. Parent will,

The SEC has adopted rules which permit companies and intermediaries (for example, brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements
and annual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or Notice of Availability of
Proxy Materials addressed to those shareholders. A number of brokers with account holders who are shareholders of the Company “household” the
Company’s proxy materials in this manner. If you have received notice from your broker it will be householding communications to your address,
householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in
householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, annual report or Notice of Availability of Proxy Materials, please notify your broker
and the Company’s Investor Relations department in writing at 12700 Hill Country Blvd., Suite T-200, Austin, Texas 78738 or by telephone at (512) 732-

eliminating duplicate mailings.

Common Stock, as applicable, outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time or Company Merger Effective Time, as applicable,

were converted into the right to receive the Partnership Unit Consideration or the Common Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) and Section
3.2(a)(i), as applicable (including, with respect to the Restricted Stock and the Deferred Stock Awards, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4(a) and

withheld with respect to such payment as provided in Section 3.5.

receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any payment to holders of Book-Entry
Shares hereunder.
(d) On or after the first anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to cause the Paying Agent to deliver
to the Surviving Company any funds made available by Parent to the Paying Agent which have not been disbursed to holders of Book-Entry Shares
representing Partnership Units or Company Common Stock, as applicable, and thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Company
with respect to the cash amounts payable upon surrender of their Book-Entry Shares. None of Parent, the Surviving Entities, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any holder of Partnership Units or Company Common Stock, as applicable, for any Merger Consideration or other amounts
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of Partnership Units or Company Common Stock, as applicable, immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to,
or become the property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

Common Stock. The applicable Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article III upon surrender of Book-Entry Shares
representing Partnership Units and Company Common Stock, as applicable, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining

Partnership Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Partnership Units except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Partnership Merger Effective Time or Company Merger Effective Time, as applicable, Book-Entry Shares
representing Partnership Units or Company Common Stock, as applicable, are presented to the Paying Agent, Surviving Company or Surviving
Partnership for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.
(f) After the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Company. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company. Until the termination of the Exchange Fund, to the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the cash portion of the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Company shall promptly replace or restore the cash portion of the
Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the cash portion of the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make all such payments.
Section 3.4 Company Compensatory Awards.
(a) Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each share of outstanding Restricted Stock (other than any Deferred Stock Award) shall,
automatically and without any action required on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon
shall lapse, and thereafter all shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby shall be considered outstanding for all purposes under this
Agreement and shall only have the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this
A-20
Table of Contents
Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the Common Stock Consideration (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting or
payment as provided in Section 3.5).
(b) All unvested Deferred Stock Awards shall, as of immediately before the Company Merger Effective Time, become vested and no longer subject to
restrictions. All Deferred Stock Awards shall, at the Company Merger Effective Time, be adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to have
allocated to the holder’s account under the Deferred Compensation Plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
Company Common Stock allocated to such account as of the Company Merger Effective Time and (ii) the Common Stock Consideration, and shall cease
to represent a right to receive a number of shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall amend the Deferred Compensation Plan to allow for
payment with respect to Deferred Stock Awards as provided in this Section 3.4. The Deferred Compensation Plan shall otherwise be administered in
accordance with its terms, and the payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan shall be made in accordance with the timing set forth in the Deferred
Compensation Plan and the applicable payment elections for participants in such plan, subject to any right to terminate the Deferred Compensation Plan
and accelerate distributions of participant account balances pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and applicable Law.
(c) At or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions
which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.4.
(d) As of the Company Merger Effective Time, the Long-Term Incentive Plan shall terminate, and the Company shall ensure that following the Company
Merger Effective Time, no participant in the Long-Term Incentive Plan, Deferred Compensation Plan or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary thereof.
(e) At the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Surviving Company cash in the amount necessary, together with the other funds
of the Surviving Company, to make the payments required under this Section 3.4, including all accrued and unpaid cash dividends on Company
Compensatory Awards, as applicable, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to make the payments required under this Section 3.4 through the
Surviving Company’s payroll as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five Business Days after the Company Merger Effective Time, or at
such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse Tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code or comply with the terms of the
Deferred Compensation Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent’s obligation to deposit cash shall include amounts sufficient to satisfy the Company’s
obligation to withhold from, and pay over to applicable taxing authorities, amounts with respect to the payments required under this Section 3.4.
Section 3.5 Withholding Rights. Each of the Company Parties, any Parent Party, the Surviving Entities, the Paying Agent (and any Affiliates or
designees of the foregoing) and any other applicable withholding agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the applicable
Merger Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any such amounts so deducted and
withheld shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

The Parent Parties hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company Parties as follows:
Section 5.1 Organization and Qualification.
(a) Each of the Parent Parties is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent applicable) under the Laws of the jurisdictions of its
formation or organization, as the case may be, and has the requisite limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and, to the extent
applicable, operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Parent Parties is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and it has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
(b) All of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Merger Sub I are, and at the Company Merger Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. All of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Merger Sub II are, and immediately prior to the

Section 5.2 Authority.
(a) Parent has the requisite limited liability company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of Parent, and no other proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Mergers or to consummate the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Parent Parties, and assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company Parties, constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the Parent Parties, enforceable against
the Parent Parties in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(b) Each of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II has the limited liability company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers to which it is a constituent entity.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II and the consummation by Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on their part, and no other proceedings on
the part of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Mergers or to consummate the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject, (i) with respect to the Company Merger, to the filing of the Company Articles of Merger with, and acceptance
for record of the Company Articles of Merger by, the SDAT and the filing of the Company Certificate of Merger with the DE SOS and (ii) with respect to
the Partnership Merger, to the filing of the Partnership Articles of Merger with, and acceptance for record of the Partnership Articles of Merger by, the
SDAT.
Section 5.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the Parent Parties do not, and the
performance of this Agreement and its obligations hereunder will not, (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the governing documents of any Parent
Party, or (b) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to any Parent Party. Except as may be required by the Exchange Act, the MGCL, the DLLCA, the
MRULPA, any applicable antitrust Laws or the rules of the NYSE, none of the Parent Parties is required to make any filing with or to obtain any consent
from any Person at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parent Parties
or the consummation by the Parent Parties of the Mergers, except where the failure to make any such filing or obtain any such consent would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. No vote of Parent’s equity holders is necessary to adopt this Agreement or to approve any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.
Section 5.4 Available Funds.
(a) Parent has received and accepted, and has delivered to the Company, a true, correct and complete fully executed copy of the Equity Commitment
Letter from the Sponsor to invest, subject to the terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein (being referred to as the
“Equity Financing”). The Equity Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, supplemented, amended or modified, no
terms thereunder have been waived, and no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, supplement, amendment, modification or waiver is
contemplated.
(b) Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter on or before
the date of this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company Parties set forth in this Agreement and the
performance in all material respects by the Company Parties of their obligations under this Agreement, at the Closing, the net
A-42
Table of Contents
proceeds contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter will be sufficient for the Parent Parties and the Surviving Entities to pay all amounts required to
be paid in connection with the Mergers and Equity Commitment Letter (including payment of the Merger Consideration, repayment or refinancing of debt
of any Acquired Company contemplated by this Agreement, and payment of all other fees and Expenses and obligations required to be paid or satisfied
by any Parent Party in connection with the Mergers and the Equity Financing).
(c) The Equity Commitment Letter is enforceable against Parent and Sponsor in accordance with its terms, in each case, except as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto, and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach under the Equity Commitment Letter. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company Parties set forth in this Agreement and the performance in all material respects by the Company Parties of
their obligations under this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the full amount of the
Equity Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amount of the Equity Financing will not be available to the Parent Parties on the
Closing Date. The Equity Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent and other conditions and contingencies to the obligations of
Sponsor to make the full amount of the Equity Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. There are no side letters or other agreements,
arrangements or understandings (written or oral) to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related (directly or indirectly) to the Equity Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter that could affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or amount of
the Equity Financing.
(d) The obligations of the Parent Parties under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parent Parties’, their respective Affiliates’ or
any other Person’s (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any of the Acquired Companies) ability to obtain the Equity Financing or any other financing.
Section 5.5 Solvency. Assuming (a) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Parent Parties’ obligation to consummate the Mergers, and after giving
effect to the Mergers, including the Equity Financing, and the payment of the Merger Consideration, (b) any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement, (c) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company Parties set forth in Article IV hereof, (d) payment
of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Mergers, (e) the financial projections or forecasts provided by the
Company to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, and (f) payment of
all related fees and Expenses, then, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Equity Financing, each of
Parent and the Surviving Entities will be Solvent as of the Company Merger Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Mergers. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term “Solvent” when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (i) the amount of the
“fair saleable value” of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the value of all “liabilities of such Person, including contingent and
other liabilities,” as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including the probable
amount of contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii) such Person
will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, “not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged” and “able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature” means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

force and effect. The Guarantee is (a) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Sponsor, and (b) enforceable in accordance with its respective terms
against the Sponsor, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law). There is no breach or default under the Guarantee by the Sponsor, and no event has occurred that would constitute a breach or default (or with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or default) thereunder by the Sponsor.

Parties or the Sponsor (or any of their respective controlled Affiliates) has entered into any Contract with any Person prohibiting or seeking to prohibit
such Person from providing or seeking to provide debt financing to any Person in connection with a transaction involving any Acquired Company in
connection with the Mergers (provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit the establishment of customary “tree” arrangements).
Section 5.8 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no Action or investigation to which any of the Parent Parties is a party (either as plaintiff or
defendant) pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent Parties, threatened before any Governmental Authority, and, to the knowledge of the Parent
Parties, there is no basis for any such Action or investigation, in each case, that is expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS
Section 7.1 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholder Approval.
(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and, after approval by Parent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form with respect to the
Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly notify the Parent Parties upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request
from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the Parent Parties
with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and promptly advise the Parent Parties of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement
received from the SEC. The Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement;
provided that, prior to responding to any comments of the SEC, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to consult and review
such response and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments on such response reasonably proposed by Parent. Prior to filing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Parent
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing
to the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to the Parent Parties and their respective Affiliates as may be required, or
otherwise reasonably requested by the Company, to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable Law. The Proxy Statement shall contain the
Board Recommendation, except to the extent that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation
Change, as permitted by and determined in accordance with Section 7.3.
(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
respective subsidiaries or Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that no amended or supplemental materials
will be filed with the SEC or mailed by the Company without affording Parent a reasonable opportunity in advance for consultation and review, and the
Company shall consider in good faith any comments on such materials reasonably proposed by Parent. Nothing in this Section 7.1(b) shall limit the
obligations of any Party under Section 7.1(a). For purposes of Section 4.23, Section 5.12 and this Section 7.1, any information concerning or related to the
Company, its Affiliates or the Stockholders Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company and any information concerning or related to
Parent or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.
(c) As promptly as practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law, the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of obtaining the Stockholder Approval; provided, that such record date shall not be more than 90 days prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting. The
Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders and shall hold the Stockholders Meeting as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement and, in any event, shall mail the definitive Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders promptly
following
A-50

the clearance thereof by the SEC (or receipt of notice that the SEC is not reviewing the preliminary Proxy Statement). The Company shall cause Holdings,
in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership, to timely send to each limited partner of the Partnership a notice of the Partnership Merger in
accordance with Section 15.1 of the Partnership Agreement. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they
give the Stockholder Approval, include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
and determined in accordance with Section 7.3(e); provided, however, that the Company’s obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Stockholders Meeting shall be unconditional unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and shall not be affected by any Adverse
Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.1(c), if, on a date for which the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled,
the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right, after consultation with Parent, to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Stockholders Meeting to the extent required by applicable Law to provide any required disclosure to the Company’s stockholders or
to the extent necessary to solicit additional proxies (provided, however, that, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Stockholders Meeting shall
not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is (i) more than 30 days after the date for which the Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law) or (ii) more than 120 days from the record date for the Stockholders
Meeting); provided, further, the Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned on the date the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled if the
Company shall have received proxies in respect of an aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock, which have not been withdrawn, such that
Stockholder Approval would be obtained at such meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, (x) the approval of the Company Merger shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters
required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company stockholders in connection with this Agreement or the approval of the Company Merger) that
the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders Meeting and (y) the Company shall not submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Competing Proposal.
Section 7.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality.
(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to and including the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to (x)
third parties that are party to any Participation Agreement (provided, that, the Company is provided a reasonable opportunity to participate in any
discussions with such third parties and Parent shall provide the Company with updates on the status of discussions upon the Company’s reasonable
request), and (y) all of the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective properties, offices, books, Contracts, personnel and records and, during such
period, the Company Parties shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, furnish
reasonably promptly to Parent and its Representatives (i) any information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries (including with respect to any
pending or threatened Action) as Parent may reasonably request and (ii) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws. In connection with such reasonable access to information, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to participate in meetings and telephone conferences with Parent and
its Representatives prior to the mailing of any Proxy Statement, prior to the Stockholders Meeting and at such other times as may be reasonably
requested. No investigation under this Section 7.2(a) or otherwise shall affect any of the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this
Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies of the
Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required by this Section 7.2(a) to provide Parent or its
A-51
Table of Contents
Representatives with access to or to disclose information (A) that would violate the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business in accordance with this Agreement
(provided, however, that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (provided, however, that the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of
any Law), or (C) that would result in a loss or waiver of any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (provided, however, that the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any
such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege, including by means of entry into a customary joint defense agreement that would
alleviate the loss of such privilege) or (D) for the purpose of allowing the Parent Parties or their respective Representatives to collect samples of soil, air,
water, groundwater or building materials. Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries that may result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder.
(b) Each Party will hold, and will cause its respective Representatives to hold, any non-public information regarding the other Party obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.2, in confidence to the
extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect pursuant to the terms thereof, notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the termination thereof; provided, however,
Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. and the Parent Parties may disclose “Information” (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to their potential
financing sources, which financing sources will be deemed to be “Representatives” (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement).
Section 7.3 No Solicitation of Transactions; Change in Recommendation.
(a) No Solicitation. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.3, from and after the date hereof through the earlier to occur of the Company Merger
Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and its and their officers and directors to, and shall direct its other Representatives to, (i) immediately cease any activities, solicitation,
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons with respect to any Competing Proposal or Inquiry and (ii) not, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage, provide any non-public information to, or take any other action for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, any Competing Proposal or Inquiry, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any other Person information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Competing Proposal or Inquiry, (C) enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or other Contract (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to a Competing Proposal or that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal or
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such Contract, an
“Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) or (D) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Promptly after the date hereof (and in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their officers and directors to,
immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access granted to any Person or its Representatives (other than the Parent Parties, their
respective Affiliates and their respective Representatives) in connection with any Inquiry, Competing Proposal or its consideration of any Competing
Proposal and request the return or destruction by such Person and its Representatives of all non-public information concerning the Company Parties.
(b) Superior Proposals and Other Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.3, but subject to compliance with the
other provisions of this Section 7.3, at any time prior to

discussions or negotiations with, furnish information (including non-public information) relating to any of the Acquired Companies to or (ii) afford access
to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of any of the Acquired Companies, in each case,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, to, any Person or group of Persons that has made, renewed or delivered to the Company a bona
fide written Competing Proposal after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval (that did not result from a breach of
this Section 7.3) or to such Person’s Representatives (including potential financing sources of such Person); provided, in each case, that the actions
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall be permitted only if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Competing Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; provided, further, that the Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if
the Company takes any of the actions described in this Section 7.3(b) and, subject to applicable Law, any non-public information concerning any of the
Acquired Companies that is provided to such Person or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) that was not previously provided to Parent or
its Representatives shall be provided or made available to Parent promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) following such time as it is provided or
made available to such Person.
(c) Notices. If the Company receives any Competing Proposal or Inquiry, then the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any event no later than 24 hours)
after receipt of such Competing Proposal or Inquiry advise Parent in writing of the receipt of such Competing Proposal or Inquiry, the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making such Competing Proposal or Inquiry and the material terms and conditions thereof, and provide to Parent copies of
any such Competing Proposal or Inquiry made in writing and any written documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and correspondence
relating thereto) and (ii) keep Parent advised, on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours), of all material developments, discussions
or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal or Inquiry and the status of such Competing Proposal or Inquiry, including notifying Parent of any
change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of any Competing Proposal or Inquiry and providing Parent copies of any written
documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and correspondence relating thereto); provided, that the Company may redact the
documentation and terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal or Inquiry, to the extent the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such redactions are required by existing contractual obligations to protect confidential information of the
business or operations of the Person making such Competing Proposal or Inquiry. The Company agrees that none of the Acquired Companies will enter
into any confidentiality or similar agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits any Acquired Company from providing any
information required to be provided to Parent in accordance with Section 7.3(b) and Section 7.3(c) within the time periods contemplated hereby.
(d) No Change in Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except as expressly permitted by Section 7.3(e), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

(B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, the Board Recommendation, (C)
take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer, or (D) adopt, approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to or agree to adopt, approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Competing Proposal (actions
described in this clause (i) being referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”); or

(e) Adverse Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior
to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the
A-53
Table of Contents
Company has not breached Section 7.3(d) or this Section 7.3(e) and has not breached the other provisions of this Section 7.3 in any material respect and
has received an unsolicited bona fide written Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.3 and that the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the
Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) (Superior Proposal) to
substantially concurrently enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for the implementation of such Competing Proposal; provided,
however, that the Company Board shall not take any action described in this Section 7.3(e) unless:
(i) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the duties of the directors of the Company Board under applicable Law; and
(ii) prior to making an Adverse Recommendation Change or so terminating this Agreement, (A) the Company has given Parent at least three Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to take such actions (which notice shall include the information with respect to such Superior Proposal that is
specified in Section 7.3(d) as well as copies of any written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements providing for such Superior
Proposal, (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good faith during the
three Business Day period following Parent’s receipt of such notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such third Business Day (the
“Match Period”) (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to propose in writing revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Company Board would no longer determine that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or the failure to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the duties of the directors of the Company Board under applicable Law and (C) at the end of the Match Period, the Company Board
shall have considered any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the Competing Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in response
to such Superior Proposal would continue to be inconsistent with the duties of the directors of the Company Board under applicable Law, in each case, if
the revisions proposed by Parent were given effect; provided, that, in the event of any change to the financial terms (including the form, amount and
timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, be required to deliver to
Parent an additional written notice consistent with that described in subclause (A) above and the Match Period shall recommence (provided that any
such new Match Period shall be a period of two Business Days following receipt by Parent of any such additional notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New
York City time) on such second Business Day) and the Company shall be required to comply with subclauses (B) and (C) above anew.
(f) Intervening Event. Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal, at any time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with the Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties of the directors of the
Company Board under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not make such an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless:
(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board has (A) so
determined and (B) resolved to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 7.3(f), which notice will specify and describe the
facts and circumstances relating to the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail and the factual bases for the Company Board’s determination
that such events or circumstances constitute an Intervening Event;
A-54
Table of Contents
(ii) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives must have negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith during the four Business Day period following Parent’s receipt of such notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time)
on such fourth Business Day (the “Notice of Intervening Event Period”) (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to allow Parent to propose
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to obviate the need to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event; and
(iii) following the Notice of Intervening Event Period, the Company Board shall have determined (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor
and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) in good faith that the
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would continue to be inconsistent with the duties of the
directors of the Company Board under applicable Law if the revisions proposed by Parent were given effect.
(g) Certain Disclosures. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Section 7.3, nothing in this Section 7.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company, the Company Board or their Representatives from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the stockholders of the Company pending disclosure of its
position thereunder; provided, that any such disclosure does not contain an Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) disclosing to the Company’s
stockholders any factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Acquired Companies or the fact that a
Competing Proposal has been made, the identity of the Person making such Competing Proposal or the material terms of such Competing Proposal, in
each case, that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel) that such disclosure is
required under applicable Law (it being understood that disclosure under this clause (ii) shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company
or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) under this Agreement and no such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change); or (iii) communicating in writing with any Person (or the Representatives of such Person) to the extent necessary to direct
such Person to the provisions of this Section 7.3; provided, however, that (A) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, except in accordance with Section 7.3(e), and (B) any such statement or disclosure made by the Company or the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) pursuant to this sentence must be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that nothing in the foregoing
will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change.
(h) Standstills and Ownership Limits. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any Person from, or waive, amend or modify
any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill or confidentiality provision with respect to a Competing Proposal or Inquiry or similar matter in
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; provided, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the duties of the directors of the Company Board under applicable Law, the Company may grant a limited waiver
of any standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit any Person to make a non-public Competing Proposal to the Company Board and, to
the extent permitted by the other subsections of this Section 7.3, thereafter negotiate and enter into any transaction in connection therewith. The
Company and the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than any Parent Party or their
Affiliates) from or render inapplicable (i) “Ownership Limit” (as defined in the Company Charter) (including by establishing or increasing an excepted
holder limit under the Company Charter); or (ii) any Takeover Statute, in each case, unless such actions are taken concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(ii).

Section 7.4 Interim Operations of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II. During the period from the date hereof through the earlier of the Partnership Merger

Section 7.5 Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect, the Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and none
of the Parties shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the other Parties’ consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, however, that (a) a Party may, without obtaining the other Parties’ consent, issue
such press release or make such public statement or filing as may be required by Law or Order if it is not possible to consult with the other Party before
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or so long as statements are
substantially similar to statements previously agreed by the Parties and (b) a Party will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to
communications that are (i) principally directed to employees, customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications are consistent with
previous releases, public disclosures or public statements made by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party) or (ii) relating to an
Adverse Recommendation Change or “stop-look-and-listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act, in each case, made in accordance with Section 7.3. The Parties have agreed upon the form of a press release announcing the Mergers
and the execution of this Agreement, and shall make such press release no later than one Business Day following the date on which this Agreement is
signed.

their respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with each other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any Contract to consummate
and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) taking all actions
necessary to cause the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied, (ii) preparing and filing any applications, notices, registrations

Authorities or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the making of all necessary or advisable registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary or advisable to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iv) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any
court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition
or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, and (v) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement; provided, that no Party will have any obligation (A)
to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
businesses of such Party, any of its Subsidiaries (including Subsidiaries of Parent after the Closing) or their Affiliates or (B) otherwise to take or commit
to take
A-56
Table of Contents
any actions that would limit the freedom of such Party, its Subsidiaries (including Subsidiaries of Parent after the Closing) or their Affiliates with respect
to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their businesses, product lines or assets. Nothing in this Section 7.6 or any other provision of this Agreement
shall require Parent or any Affiliates of Parent (including Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”)) to agree or otherwise be required to take any action, including
any action with respect to any Affiliates of Parent (including Blackstone, any investment funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or
advised by, Blackstone or its Affiliates, or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) or investment of
Blackstone or of any such investment fund or investment vehicle), or any interest therein (in each case other than with respect to the Parent Parties and
their Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries)).
(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing Section 7.6(a), each of the Parties shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give)
any notices to third parties, and each of the Parties shall use, and cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third-party consents that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the Parties will, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required applications, notices, registrations and requests as may be
required or advisable to be filed with any Governmental Authority and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including promptly informing the other Party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental
Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between such Party and any Governmental
Authority with respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties or their Representatives shall have the right to review in
advance and each of the Parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the other and each of their Affiliates that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except that confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent reasonably
practicable, no Party shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without giving the other Parties prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other Parties the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such
meeting with such Governmental Authority.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives shall, and none of the Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be obligated to, pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or
incur any liability or other obligation to such Person. Subject to the immediately foregoing sentence, the Parties shall cooperate with respect to
reasonable accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.
Section 7.7 Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation.
(a) The Company and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties and their Representatives shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
A-57
Table of Contents
(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation
or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to expect that the applicable
conditions set forth in Article VIII would reasonably be expected to be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement or any remedies for any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure by the Company, the Parent Parties or their respective Representatives to provide such prompt
notice under this Section 7.7(b) shall not constitute a breach of covenant for purposes of Section 8.2(b), Section 8.3(b), Section 9.1(c)(i) (Parent
Terminating Breach), or Section 9.1(d)(i) (Company Terminating Breach).
(c) The Company and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties and their Representatives shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any Action commenced or, to such Party’s knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries, respectively, or any of its or their respective directors, officers or partners that relates to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (“Transaction Litigation”) and shall keep the other Parties informed on a reasonably current basis with
respect to the status thereof (including by promptly furnishing to the other Parties such information relating to such Actions as may be reasonably
requested, subject to the preservation of privilege). The Company and its Representatives shall give Parent the opportunity to reasonably participate in
the defense and settlement of any Transaction Litigation against the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their directors, officers or partners relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall give due consideration to Parent’s advice with respect to such Action and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Section 7.8 Other Employee Benefits.
(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time and for a period of not less than 12 months after the Closing Date, but solely during any period of
employment, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entities to provide to each employee of the Acquired Companies who continues employment with
Parent or any Acquired Company following the Company Merger Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) a base salary that is no less
than the base salary provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and (ii) paid-time off, qualified
retirement and health insurance benefits that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and (iii) severance benefits as set forth on Schedule 7.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. In addition, for
each Continuing Employee who remains employed by Parent or any Acquired Company on December 31, 2022, except as set forth on Schedule 7.8(a)(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, (A) such Continuing Employee will be eligible to receive, no later than February 1, 2023, (x) an annual cash bonus with
respect to fiscal 2022 no less than the annual cash bonus paid to such Continuing Employee with respect to fiscal 2021 (or, if such Continuing Employee
was not employed by Parent or any Acquired Company prior to fiscal 2022, no less than such Continuing Employee’s fiscal 2022 target annual cash
bonus) and (y) a “deferred cash award” with a value no less than the grant date value of the restricted stock award granted to such employee with
respect to fiscal 2021 (or, if such Continuing Employee was not employed by Parent or any Acquired Company prior to fiscal 2022, no less than such
Continuing Employee’s fiscal 2022 target restricted stock award value), which deferred cash award shall vest on January 1, 2026, subject to such
Continuing Employee’s continued employment with Parent or any Acquired Company through such date, and (B) such Continuing Employee’s fiscal 2023
compensation shall be determined in a manner consistent with Schedule 7.8(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter). To the extent that the termination of
employment of some or all employees of the Acquired Companies who are not Continuing Employees results in or contributes to the existence of a
qualifying event under any WARN Act following the Closing, Parent shall be responsible for all notice and payment requirements under such WARN
Act.
A-58
Table of Contents
(b) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Company Merger Effective Time, each Continuing Employee receives full credit (solely for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits) for service with the Acquired Companies (or predecessor employers to the extent the
Acquired Companies provides such past service credit) under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving
Entities, as applicable, in which such employees became participants; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. As of the Company Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entities to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had
accrued under any applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the Company Merger Effective Time. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entities for the benefit of Continuing Employees, Parent shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such
plan, and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar
Company Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Company Merger Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Entities, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs.
(c) Nothing in this Section 7.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to or modification of
any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating any of its employee benefit or compensation
plans or other arrangements in accordance their terms, (iii) create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Acquired Companies or other Person with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent or any Acquired
Company or under any benefit plan which Parent or the Surviving Entities may maintain.
Section 7.9 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.
(a) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall bind, effective at the Company Merger Effective Time, extended coverage under the
Company’s officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policy by obtaining a prepaid six-year “tail”/extended period on the Company’s existing officers’ and
directors’ liability insurance policies (or with insurers on terms and conditions no less favorable than such policies), which prepaid policies provide such
Persons currently covered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Company Merger Effective Time, for an overall additional premium not to exceed 300% of the total annual premiums at the last
renewal; provided, that the Company shall reasonably cooperate and consult with Parent prior to the purchase of any such tail policy; provided, further,
that if Parent can procure a “tail” policy on superior terms or on equivalent terms, but at a lower price, as compared to any such policy that may be
procured by the Company, then, subject to Schedule 7.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent may obtain such policy effective as of the Company
Merger Effective Time, in which case the Company shall not obtain such policy. The Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to) maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, during the period commencing as of the Company Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to: (i) indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each current or former manager, director, officer and trustee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (each, an “Indemnified
Party” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action to the extent such Action arises out of or pertains to
A-59
Table of Contents
any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Party’s capacity as a manager, director, officer or trustee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time), including such alleged acts or omissions with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such Action the expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and any expenses incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
indemnification) of any Indemnified Party without the requirement of any bond or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Law, but
subject to Parent’s or the Surviving Company’s receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, (i) shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit or proceeding against, or investigation of, any Indemnified Party for which indemnification may be
sought under this Section 7.9(b) without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (ii) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without Parent’s or the Surviving
Company’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (iii) shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification, in which case the Indemnified Party shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Company the
amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto, and (iv) shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one legal
counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single legal action,
except to the extent that, on the advice of any such Indemnified Party’s counsel, two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests
in the outcome of such action. Parent’s and the Surviving Company’s obligations under this Section 7.9(b) shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six years from the Company Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.
(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Company to, during the period
commencing as of the Company Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, honor all rights to
indemnification, advancement and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time now
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as currently provided in (i) the Governing Documents, and (ii) indemnification agreements between the
Company and any Indemnified Party as scheduled on Schedule 7.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. For a period of six years following the Company
Merger Effective Time, the governing documents of Parent and the equivalent governing or organizational documents of any applicable Subsidiary of
Parent or the Company shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years following the Company Merger Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely modify these rights, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent
required by Law.
(d) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up,
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.9.

Table of Contents
(e) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who are intended
third-party beneficiaries of this Section 7.9 effective following the Closing), his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving Company. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 7.9
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Indemnified Party unless (i) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification. Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 7.9, is intended to, shall (i) be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any Subsidiaries of the Company
or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.9 is not prior to, or in substitution for,
any such claims under any such policies or (ii) impair or limit any other rights an Indemnified Party may have to indemnification, advancement, or
exculpation pursuant to applicable Law, written agreements, or current or former Governing Documents.
Section 7.10 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may
reasonably be necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including

Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.
Section 7.11 Distribution of REIT Taxable Income. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
may declare and pay a dividend (including under Section 858 or Section 860 of the Code) on the Company Common Stock to its stockholders, the
Partnership may make distributions on the Partnership Units, and each Subsidiary REIT may make distributions (including under Section 858 or Section
860 of the Code) to its stockholders, in each case, distributing cash in such amounts determined by the Company or such Subsidiary REIT, as applicable,
in its sole discretion exercised in good faith to be required (after giving effect to the distributions contemplated by Section 6.1(b)(iii)) to be distributed in
order for the Company or such Subsidiary REIT to maintain its qualification as a REIT for such year and to avoid or reduce the incurrence of income or
excise Tax; provided, that the Common Stock Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of any such dividend on
Company Common Stock declared or paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.11.
Section 7.12 Financing and Cooperation.
(a) Debt Financing.
(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and shall cause each Subsidiary of the Company to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, to the Parent Parties, in each case at Parent’s sole expense, all customary cooperation reasonably
requested in writing by Parent (e-mail being sufficient) in connection with the offering, arrangement, syndication, consummation or issuance of any
financing with respect to the Acquired Companies and the Company Properties effective as of or after the Partnership Merger Effective Time (the “Debt
Financing”) (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its
Affiliates), including using commercially reasonable efforts to:

meetings (including one-on-one meetings or conference calls with providers of the Debt Financing), drafting sessions, road shows, rating agency

the Acquired Companies;
(3) furnish Parent, reasonably promptly upon written request, with such historical and projected financial, statistical and other pertinent information

(4) assist with the preparation of customary definitive loan documentation contemplated by the Debt Financing (including schedules), including any
customary guarantee, pledge and security documents (provided that any such documents or agreements and any obligations contained in such

to the occurrence of, the Closing);

Company Subsidiary pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company;
(14) as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and no earlier than immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time on the Closing Date, and

allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in the events set out in this clause (vi)); (vii) requires the Acquired Companies to take
any action that is prohibited or restricted by, or would conflict with or violate, its organizational documents, or would result in a violation or breach of, or

course of business of Acquired Companies at the time requested by Parent or (B) for the failure to obtain review of any financial or other information by
its accountants after using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the same. In no event shall the Acquired Companies be required to pay any
commitment or other fee or give an indemnity or incur any liability (including due to any act or omission by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives) or expense (including legal and accounting expenses) in connection with assisting the Parent Parties in
arranging the Debt Financing or as a result of any information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or
arranging the Debt Financing or as a result of any information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (except those fees, expenses, financial
commitments or other financial obligations for which the Company is reimbursed by Parent). None of the representations, warranties or covenants of the
Company Parties set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the actions taken by the Company,
any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives at the request of Parent pursuant to Section 7.12. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 7.12(a)(ii) represent the sole obligation of the Acquired
Companies and their respective Affiliates with respect to cooperation in connection with the Debt Financing.
(iii) Parent shall reimburse the Acquired Companies promptly upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ and accountants’ fees) (other than in respect of the preparation of customary historical financials) incurred by the Acquired Companies and its

(including the dissolution and termination of any subsidiaries formed and documentation entered into pursuant to Section 7.12), and shall indemnify and

connection with the arrangement and consummation of the Debt Financing and any information used in connection therewith (other than the information
provided in writing by the Company or the other Acquired Companies to Parent specifically in connection with their obligations pursuant to Section
7.12(a)). The provisions of this Section 7.12(a)(iii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the foregoing Financing
Indemnified Parties. This Section 7.12(a)(iii) shall survive the termination of this Agreement (and in the event the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation under Section 7.12, and not previously reimbursed).
(iv) All confidential information regarding the Acquired Companies obtained by the Parent Parties and their respective Affiliates and Representatives

accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, without the prior written consent of the Company, in no event will the Parent
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will be deemed to include each direct investor in the Parent Parties) enter into any
agreement, arrangement or any other understanding, whether written or oral, with any potential source of Debt Financing that would reasonably be
expected to limit, restrict, restrain, otherwise impair in any manner, directly or indirectly, the ability of such source of Debt Financing to provide Debt
Financing or other assistance to any other party in any other transaction involving the Acquired Company (provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit
the establishment of customary “tree” arrangements).
(v) Prior to the Closing Date, upon the request of the Company, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. The Parent Parties acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a condition to Closing

obtaining (or the failure to obtain) the Debt Financing.

(i) Promptly following Parent’s request, the Company Parties shall, or shall cause the other applicable Acquired Companies and shall use commercially

or documents (the “Assumption Documents”) (A) confirming (1) the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness outstanding under such Assumed
Indebtedness, (2) the date to which interest and principal has been paid in respect of such Assumed Indebtedness, and (3) the amount of any escrows

replacement of any guaranty and the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to the modifications
of the terms of such Assumed Indebtedness that Parent may reasonably request after the date hereof; provided that the Company shall be informed of
any such request or modification; provided, further, that, in the event Parent requests Assumption Documents in accordance with this Section 7.12(b), (x)
the consummation of the Mergers shall not be conditioned on, or delayed or postponed as a result of the receipt of (or failure to receive) such
Assumption Documents from all or any portion of the Existing Lenders and (y) the Assumption Documents will be effective as of or immediately prior to
and conditioned on the occurrence of the Partnership Merger Effective Time.
(ii) Parent shall pay all fees and expenses payable in connection with the Assumption Documents, including premiums for any endorsements to or re-date
of the title insurance policy previously issued to the Existing Lenders, servicing fees, rating agency fees, assignment and assumption fees, attorneys’
fees and disbursements and processing fees required to be paid to the Existing Lenders as a condition to issuance of the Assumption Documents. None
of the Acquired Companies shall be obligated to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection with

by this Agreement. The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than the Parent Parties or their respective Affiliates) from, or
render inapplicable, any Takeover Statute of any jurisdiction or Charter Restrictions that may purport to be applicable to the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise cause any restrictions in any Takeover Statute or Charter Restrictions not to apply to any
such Person.

Parent Parties are prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing and irrevocably waiving any right to claim that the conditions to their obligations to

payment is not concurrently made, such termination shall be null and void; or
(iii) if (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 have been and continue to be satisfied or waived by Parent (other than those

and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of the Company Parties or the Parent Parties or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, relating to, based on or arising under or out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the subject matter hereof
(including the negotiation and performance of this Agreement), except that the provisions of Section 7.2(b) (Access to Information; Confidentiality),
Section 7.12(a)(iii) and Section 7.12(b)(ii) (Financing and Cooperation), the last sentence of Section 7.17 (Parent-Approved Transactions), this Section
9.2, Section 9.3 (Fees and Expenses), Section 9.5 (Amendment) and Article X (General Provisions) of this Agreement shall survive the termination hereof
and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms; provided, that, subject to Section 10.10(c), no such termination shall
relieve any Party from any liability or damages resulting from any fraud or Willful Breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, obligations
or agreements set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; provided, that the Parent Parties shall each be treated as if they were a party thereto
to the same extent as Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C., and (b) the Guarantee shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full

Section 9.3 Fees and Expenses.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.3 or Article X, all Expenses shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or Expenses, except that
Parent shall pay, whether or not the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement is consummated, all costs and Expenses in
connection with the Paying Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall pay the Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(b) In the event that:
(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) (Superior Proposal);
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii) (Adverse Recommendation Change/Other Company Actions); or
(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) (Outside Date) (and at the time of such termination the
Company would not have been entitled to terminate this
A-72
Table of Contents
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii) (Parent Failure to Close)) or Section 9.1(b)(iii) (Failure to Obtain Stockholder Approval), or by Parent pursuant
to Section 9.1(d)(i) (Company Terminating Breach), (B) a Competing Proposal shall have been received by the Company or its Representatives or any
Person shall have publicly proposed or made (or publicly announced an intention, whether or not conditional, to make) a Competing Proposal (and, in the
case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii), such Competing Proposal or publicly proposed or announced intention shall have been made prior to
the Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof)), and (C) within 12 months following such termination, the Company enters into
a definitive written agreement providing for the implementation of any Competing Proposal or any Competing Proposal is consummated (provided, that
for purposes of this Section 9.3(b)(iii), the term “Competing Proposal” will have the meaning assigned to such term herein, except that each of the 15%
thresholds included in the definition of “Competing Proposal” shall be increased to 50%);
then the Company shall pay, as directed by Parent, the Company Termination Payment. Payment of the Company Termination Payment shall be made by
wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent as follows: (1) in the case of Section 9.3(b)(i), prior to or concurrently
with termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii); (2) in the case of Section 9.3(b)(ii), within three Business Days after termination of this

definitive agreement in respect of the Competing Proposal referred to in clause (B) of Section 9.3(b)(iii), and (y) concurrently with the consummation of
such Competing Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this Section 9.3(b) shall be payable only once with
respect to Section 9.3(b), and not in duplication, even though such payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof. In the event that
Parent shall receive full payment of the Company Termination Payment pursuant to this Section 9.3(b), the receipt of the Company Termination Payment
(and the costs and expenses contemplated by the following sentence) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and shall be the Parent Parties’ sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives shall have no further liability, whether pursuant to
a claim at Law or in equity, to the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Action against
the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination. If the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Payment when due and any Parent Party commences a suit which results in a final,
non-appealable judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Payment or any portion thereof, then the Company shall pay, in accordance
with Section 9.4, the Parent Parties their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the Company Termination Payment at the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, without compounding).
(c) In the event that:
(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) (Parent Terminating Breach); or
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii) (Failure to Close);
then Parent shall pay, as directed by the Company, the Parent Termination Payment by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by the
Company within three Business Day following such termination in
A-73
Table of Contents
accordance with this Section 9.3. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by Parent under this Section 9.3(c) shall be payable only once with
respect to Section 9.3(c), and not in duplication, even though such payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof. In the event that the
Company shall receive full payment of the Parent Termination Payment pursuant to this Section 9.3(c), the receipt of the Parent Termination Payment (and
the costs and expenses contemplated by the following sentence) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and shall be the Company Parties’ sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company Parties or any of their Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and, except for the amounts payable or reimbursable by Parent pursuant to Section 7.12(a)(iii), Section
7.12(b)(ii) and the last sentence of Section 7.17 (collectively, the “Parent Expenses”) and the last sentence of this Section 9.3(c), none of the Parent Parties
or their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability, whether pursuant to a claim at Law or in equity, to the Company or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and
the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of the Company Parties or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Action against the Parent Parties or their respective Affiliates or Representatives for damages
or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. If Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Payment and/or any
Parent Expenses and the Company commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against Parent for the Parent Termination Payment
and/or any Parent Expenses, or any portions thereof, then Parent shall pay the Company in accordance with Section 9.4, its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Parent Termination Payment and/or the Parent
Expenses at the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding) (the “Recovery
Costs”).
(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that neither the Company Termination Payment nor the Parent Termination Payment is intended to be a penalty
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the
Company Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Section 9.4 Payment of Amount or Expenses.
(a) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Company the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs set forth

the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs, with an escrow agent selected by Parent pursuant to a written escrow agreement (the “Parent Termination
Payment Escrow Agreement”) with such terms (subject to this Section 9.4(a)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow
agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs, pursuant to this
Section 9.4(a) shall be made at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Company such amount pursuant to Section 9.3 by wire transfer. The Parent
Termination Payment Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs, in escrow
or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the
Company’s independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company without
causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year determined as if the payment of
such amount did

not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A) through (I) or 856(c)(3)(A) through (I) of the Code (“Qualifying Income”) or a subsequent letter
from the Company’s accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Company; (ii) a letter from the
Company’s counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Company of the Parent Termination
Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs, should either constitute Qualifying Income or be excluded from gross income within the

effect that the receipt by the Company of the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs, should either constitute
Qualifying Income or be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall

Company designating a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of the Company as the recipient of the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the
Recovery Costs, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the
Recovery Costs, to the Company or its designee. Parent agrees to amend this Section 9.4(a) at the request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the
portion of the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs, that may be distributed to the Company hereunder without
causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Company’s chances of securing a
favorable ruling described in this Section 9.4(a) or (z) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in
this Section 9.4(a). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the
Recovery Costs, that remains unpaid as of the end of a tax year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following tax year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this Section 9.4(a); provided, that any portion of the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs, that
remains unpaid as of December 31 following the date which is five years from the date of this Agreement shall be released by the escrow agent to the
Company. The Parent Termination Payment Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Company shall bear all costs and expenses under the Parent
Termination Payment Escrow Agreement.

and expenses contemplated by Section 9.3(b), with an escrow agent selected by the Company pursuant to a written escrow agreement (the “Company
Termination Payment Escrow Agreement”) with such terms (subject to this Section 9.4(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by Parent, the Company and
the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Company Termination Payment, plus the costs and expenses contemplated by Section
9.3(b), pursuant to this Section 9.4(b) shall be made at the time the Company is obligated to pay Parent such amount pursuant to Section 9.3 by wire
transfer. The Company Termination Payment Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Company Termination Payment, plus the costs and expenses
contemplated by Section 9.3(b), in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination
of the following: (i) a letter from the independent certified public accountants of any direct or indirect equity owner of Parent that is a REIT indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing such direct or indirect equity owner of Parent that is a REIT to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from such direct or indirect equity owner’s accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent

Section 10.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future

remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
Section 10.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall
be deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by
electronic mail in portable document form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.
Section 10.5 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (including the Exhibits, Schedules and the Company Disclosure Letter),
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and (b) except for the provisions of Section 7.9 (which, from and after

the representations and warranties of the other Parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance by the other Parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.
Section 10.7 Governing Law; Venue.
(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Maryland (other than with respect to issues relating to the Mergers that are required to be governed by DLLCA) without giving effect to its conflicts
of laws principles (whether the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Maryland).
(b) All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Maryland
and/or the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (the “Chosen Courts”). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits

have to the laying of venue of any such dispute, (v) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such dispute, and (vi) agrees, with respect to any Action filed in a Maryland state court, to jointly request an assignment to the Maryland

Management Program. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such dispute shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.
Section 10.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties; provided that, prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders, each of the Parent Parties may assign any of their rights hereunder to any Affiliate of
Parent without the prior written consent of the Company, but no such assignment (x) shall relieve such Parent Party of any of its obligations hereunder or
(y) impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the first sentence of this Section 10.8, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
purported assignment not permitted under this Section 10.8 shall be null and void.

representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As a material
inducement to the Company Parties’ willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform their obligations hereunder, prior to Closing, Parent hereby
unconditionally guarantees full performance and payment by Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to
be performed by Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, as applicable, under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to
all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such
representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II
shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company Parties shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and
all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against any or all of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II
in the first instance.
Section 10.10 Specific Performance; Parent Liability Cap.
(a) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the
Company Parties in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Company Parties, and that money damages or other legal
remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such harm. The Parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 9.1 and any dispute over the right to termination has been finally resolved, (i) the Parent Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 10.7 to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company Parties and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity or pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers, and without that right, the Parent Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. The Company Parties agree that they will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis
that the Parent Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that any such injunction or award of specific performance or other equitable relief is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason. It is explicitly agreed that none of the Company Parties shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing any Parent Party’s obligations to consummate the Mergers or otherwise to prevent and/or remedy
a breach of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms hereof. It is further explicitly agreed that the Company Parties’ sole and exclusive remedy
relating to a breach of this Agreement by any Parent Party or otherwise shall be to seek recovery of the Parent Termination Payment, in the circumstances
in which it is payable in accordance with Section 9.3(c), and the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs;

provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to
prevent any breach of Section 7.2(b).
(b) The Parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 10.10, none of the Parent Parties shall in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to them under or in connection with this Agreement (including monetary damages) for
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for
in this Section 10.10 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 10.10 shall require the Parent Parties to
institute any Action for (or limit any Parent Party’s right to institute any Action for) specific performance under this Section 10.10 prior or as a condition
to exercising any termination right under Article IX (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Action pursuant
to this Section 10.10 or anything set forth in this Section 10.10 restrict or limit any Parent Party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of Article IX or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time. In any Action seeking monetary damages
against a Party or to compel the Company Parties to specifically perform its obligations hereunder, the non-prevailing Party in such Action (after a final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) shall promptly reimburse the prevailing Party its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) in connection with such Action.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Parties, together, for monetary damages,
losses, costs or expenses of the Company Parties or their Affiliates in connection with the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be consummated, a breach of this Agreement by any Parent Party or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Recovery Costs (collectively, the “Parent Liability Cap”). In no
event shall the Company Parties or any of their Affiliates seek or permit to be sought on their behalf any amount in excess of the Parent Liability Cap from
the Parent Related Persons in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any other document,
or any theory of law or equity (including by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil) or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. Each of the Company Parties agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no liability shall attach to, any of the Parent Related Persons
(other than against the Parent Parties as provided by Section 9.3 and this Section 10.10), through any Parent Party or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of any Parent Party against
any Parent Related Person, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the Sponsor (but not any other Parent Related Person) under and to the extent provided in
the Guarantee and subject to the Parent Liability Cap and the other limitations described herein. Recourse against Sponsor under the Guarantee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Parties and their respective Affiliates against Sponsor and any other Parent Related Persons (other than
the Parent Parties to the extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. to the extent provided in the Confidentiality
Agreement) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or
in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. Without limiting the rights of the Company against the Parent Parties hereunder and Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. under the
Confidentiality Agreement, in no event shall the Company Parties or their Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of
this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from, any Parent Related Person (other than Sponsor to the extent provided in the Guarantee and
subject to the Parent Liability Cap and the other limitations described therein). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in Section 9.3 or this Section 10.10 shall limit the remedies of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement.
