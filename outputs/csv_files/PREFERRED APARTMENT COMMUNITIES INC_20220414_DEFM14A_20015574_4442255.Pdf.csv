The Special Meeting (page 28) The Proposals The virtual special meeting of our stockholders will be held on June 7, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APTS2022SM. At the virtual special meeting, holders of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as “common stock,” as of the record date, which was the close of 2 business on April 11, 2022, will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, which proposal we refer to as the “merger proposal,” (2) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers, which proposal we refer to as the “advisory compensation proposal,” and (3) a proposal to approve any adjournment of the virtual special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the virtual special meeting to approve the merger proposal, which proposal we refer to as the “adjournment proposal.” If the merger is approved by our stockholders and completed as contemplated by the merger agreement, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting. Record Date, Notice and Quorum All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on April 11, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, our outstanding voting securities consisted of 64,341,143 shares of common stock. All holders of record of our preferred stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, but may not vote at, the virtual special meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the virtual special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the virtual special meeting. Virtual attendance at the virtual special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the virtual special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the virtual special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Required Vote Completion of the mergers requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting against the merger proposal. The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the approval of the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the mergers. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. The vote of the holders of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as “Series A preferred stock,” our Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as “Series A1 preferred stock,” our Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as “Series M preferred stock,” and our Series M1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as “Series M1 preferred stock,” is not required to approve any of the proposals at the virtual special meeting and is not being solicited. We use the term “preferred stock” in this proxy statement to refer to the Series A preferred stock, Series A1 preferred stock, Series M preferred stock and Series M1 preferred stock, collectively. As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 1,341,751 shares of our common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 2.09% of the total combined voting power of our common stock at the virtual special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so. 3 Proxies; Revocation Any of our common stockholders of record entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of common stock by returning the enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live webcast.

LLC At the February 16, 2022 meeting of the board of directors, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) rendered to the board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated February 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 16, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with Goldman Sachs’ opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference in its entirety. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the board of directors in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of common stock should vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter.

Excluded common stock will be automatically retired and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the merger.

Treatment of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company Warrants, Time-Vested Restricted Stock, Performance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units (page 68) Common Stock The merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of common stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than shares of common stock held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by the Parent Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded common stock”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $25.00 per share, without interest (such per share amount, the “common stock consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Preferred Stock The merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of preferred stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than shares of preferred stock held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by the Parent Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded preferred stock”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $1,000.00 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the closing date, with respect thereto, without interest (such per share amount, the “preferred stock 5 consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded preferred stock will be automatically retired and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the merger. Company Warrants Prior to the merger effective time, we will amend the agreements (which we refer to as the “warrant agreements”) governing the outstanding warrants to purchase common stock (which we refer to as “company warrants”) effective as of the merger effective time, such that each holder of a company warrant that is thereafter exercisable, but not exercised as of the merger effective time, shall be entitled, upon exercise, to receive in respect of each share of common stock underlying such company warrant only an amount of cash equal to the difference between the common stock consideration and the exercise price (as set forth in the applicable warrant agreement) for each such share (such per share amount, the “company warrant amount”). Prior to the merger effective time, we will notify the warrant agent in accordance with the warrant agreements (as amended) with respect to the outstanding company warrants that, as of the merger effective time, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than excluded common stock) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the common stock consideration, and that the terms of the company warrants will be adjusted so that the holder of any company warrant exercised after such date shall be entitled to receive in cash the company warrant amount only with respect to each share of common stock underlying such company warrant immediately prior to the merger effective time. Time-Vested Restricted Stock The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of unvested time-vested restricted common stock (which we refer to as a “time-vested restricted stock”) granted pursuant to the Company’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan or the Company’s 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (which we refer to collectively as the “long-term incentive plans”) will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive the common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Performance Stock Units The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding award of unvested performance-based restricted stock unit (which we refer to as a “performance stock unit”) granted pursuant to the long-term incentive plans, which remains subject to vesting based all or in part on future achievement of performance goals, will become earned and vested with respect to that number of shares of common stock subject to such performance stock unit in accordance with the terms of such performance stock unit (but without applying any pro-ration for the number of days of employment during the shortened performance period ending on the closing date) based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals set forth in the award agreement governing such performance stock unit (as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors) as measured from the beginning of the applicable performance period through the closing date (or the latest practicable date prior thereto that performance can be assessed) (each such earned performance stock unit, and each other outstanding performance stock unit for which the applicable performance period completed prior to the closing date but which remains subject to service vesting conditions, an “earned PSU”). At the merger effective time, each earned PSU will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment withholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned PSU. Additionally, in no event later than five business days after the merger effective time or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code, we will pay to each holder of earned PSUs an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes. Each performance stock unit that does not become an earned PSU will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time. Restricted Stock Units The merger agreement provides that (1) each restricted stock unit that vests upon the satisfaction of service conditions and becomes earned based on our market capitalization increases relevant to target market thresholds (which we refer to as a “market cap restricted stock unit”) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time and that is a vested market cap restricted stock unit that becomes an “Earned RSU” (as defined in the award agreement governing such market cap restricted stock unit) prior to the merger effective time (which we refer to as an “earned RSU”), and (2) each restricted stock unit subject to a service-based vesting requirement granted under the long-term incentive plans (which we refer to as a “time-vested RSU” and, together with the time-vested restricted stock, the performance stock units and market cap restricted stock units, the “compensatory awards”) (whether vested or unvested) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time, will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment withholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned RSU or time- 6 vested RSU (as applicable). Any issued and outstanding market cap restricted stock unit that is not an earned RSU as of immediately prior to the merger effective time will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time. Treatment of Interests in the Partnership (page 69) Class A Partnership Units The merger agreement provides that, at the partnership merger effective time, each Class A unit of the Partnership, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than Class A partnership units held by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or by Parent, Merger Sub II or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded Class A partnership units”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock consideration, without interest (such per unit amount, the “partnership unit consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Class A partnership units, general partnership interests in the Partnership, and Series A redeemable preferred units of the Partnership, Series A1 redeemable preferred units of the Partnership, Series M redeemable preferred units of the Partnership and Series M1 redeemable preferred units of the Partnership (which we refer to collectively as “preferred partnership units”), in each case, held by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company will be unaffected by the partnership merger and will remain outstanding as partnership units of the Surviving Partnership held by the Company or the relevant wholly owned subsidiary. Class A partnership units and preferred partnership units held by Parent, Merger Sub II or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the partnership merger. As discussed above, if we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, or to avoid or reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the partnership unit consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock. Class B Partnership Units The merger agreement provides that each vested Class B Unit of the Partnership, which we refer to as the “Class B partnership units,” or fraction thereof, that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time that becomes an “Earned Class B Unit” (pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement) and which has a “Capital Account” (as defined in the partnership agreement (as defined below)) equal to the “Average Capital Account Balance” (as defined in the partnership agreement) (taking into account any allocations that would be deemed to occur pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement) will automatically be converted into a Class A partnership unit at the partnership merger effective time. Pursuant to the award agreements, all of the Class B partnership units became Earned Class B Units and converted into Class A partnership units on March 31, 2022, and as such, the provisions in the merger agreement applicable to the conversion of unvested Class B partnership units no longer apply. This proxy statement does not constitute any solicitation of consents in respect of the partnership merger, and does not constitute an offer to exchange the Class A partnership units. Treatment of Interests in Operations (page 70) The merger agreement provides that, at the operations merger effective time, each preferred share of Operations (which we refer to as “operations preferred shares”) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the operations merger effective time (other than operations preferred shares held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by the Parent Parties or any of their subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded operations preferred shares” and, together with excluded common stock, excluded preferred stock and excluded Class A partnership units, the “excluded securities”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $1,100.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the closing date, with respect thereto (such per share amount, the “operations preferred share consideration” and, together with the common stock consideration, the preferred stock consideration and the partnership unit consideration, the “merger consideration”), less any applicable withholding taxes. Each common share of Operations held by any person and each excluded operations preferred share will be automatically retired and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the operations merger.

Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent expects to cause the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, if any, to be repaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans to be repaid or remain outstanding. As of April 11, 2022 we had no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and as of March 31, 2022 we had approximately $2.4 billion in mortgage loans outstanding. Parent has informed us that it currently intends to pursue obtaining debt financing to be provided in connection with the mergers. In addition, it is expected that BREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Sponsor”), which is the operating partnership of BREIT, and its affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt financing. Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and expenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the potential debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned by us, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings. The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the mergers. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide, all customary cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in connection with the arrangement of debt financing with respect to us or our subsidiaries, or our or our subsidiaries’ real property. For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement-Financing Cooperation” and “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Mergers.” Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (page 54) Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally.

Record Date, Notice and Quorum All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on April 11, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, our outstanding voting securities consisted of 64,341,143 shares of common stock. All holders of record of our preferred stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, but may not vote at, the virtual special meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the virtual special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the virtual special meeting. Virtual attendance at the virtual special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the virtual special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the virtual special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Required Vote Completion of the mergers requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting against the merger proposal. The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the approval of the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the mergers. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. The vote of the holders of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as “Series A preferred stock,” our Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as “Series A1 preferred stock,” our Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as “Series M preferred stock,” and our Series M1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as “Series M1 preferred stock,” is not required to approve any of the proposals at the virtual special meeting and is not being solicited. We use the term “preferred stock” in this proxy statement to refer to the Series A preferred stock, Series A1 preferred stock, Series M preferred stock and Series M1 preferred stock, collectively. As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 1,341,751 shares of our common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 2.09% of the total combined voting power of our common stock at the virtual special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so. 3 Proxies; Revocation Any of our common stockholders of record entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of common stock by returning the enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live webcast. If the shares of common stock that you own are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your broker or you may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by your delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy card, by authorizing your proxy by telephone or through the Internet at a later date than your previously authorized proxy, by your filing a written revocation of your proxy with our Corporate Secretary or by your voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting alone will not be sufficient to revoke a previously authorized proxy. If you own common stock in “street name,” you may revoke or change previously granted voting instructions by following the instructions provided by the broker, bank or other nominee that is the registered owner of the shares or by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting. The Mergers (page 31) Pursuant to the merger agreement, on the closing date, Merger Sub II will merge with and into the Partnership and the separate existence of Merger Sub II will cease, and the Partnership will be the surviving partnership in the partnership merger. We use the term “Surviving Partnership” in this proxy statement to refer to the Partnership following the partnership merger effective time. The Surviving Partnership will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company following the partnership merger effective time. The partnership merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the partnership merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or on such other date and time as may be agreed between the parties to the merger agreement and specified in the partnership certificate of merger. We use the term “partnership merger effective time” in this proxy statement to refer to the time the partnership merger becomes effective. Immediately following the partnership merger effective time, on the closing date, Operations will be merged with and into Merger Sub III and the separate existence of Operations will cease, and Merger Sub III will be the surviving entity in the operations merger. We use the term “Surviving Operations Entity” in this proxy statement to refer to Merger Sub III following the operations merger effective time. The Surviving Operations Entity will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Surviving Partnership following the operations merger effective time. The operations merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the operations merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or on such other date and time as may be agreed between the parties to the merger agreement and specified in the operations certificate of merger. We use the term “operations merger effective time” in this proxy statement to refer to the time the operations merger becomes effective. Immediately following the operations merger effective time, on the closing date, we will merge with and into Merger Sub I and the separate existence of the Company will cease, and Merger Sub I will continue as the surviving entity in the merger. We use the term “Surviving Company” in this proxy statement to refer to Merger Sub I following the effective time of the merger. The Surviving Company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and the Surviving Partnership will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Surviving Company following the merger effective time. Our merger with Merger Sub I will become effective upon the later of the acceptance for record of the articles of merger with respect to the merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, the filing of the certificate of merger with respect to the merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or on such other date and time (not to exceed 30 days from the date the articles of merger with respect to the merger are accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland) as may be agreed between the parties to the merger agreement and specified in the articles of merger and the company certificate of merger. We use the term “merger effective time” in this proxy statement to refer to the time the merger becomes effective. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties to the merger agreement, the partnership merger effective time, the operations merger effective time and the merger effective time will occur on the closing date, with the operations merger effective time occurring immediately after the partnership merger effective time, and the merger effective time occurring immediately after the operations merger effective time. We use the term “Surviving Entities” to refer to the Surviving Company, Surviving Partnership and Surviving Operations Entity, collectively. 4 Recommendation of Our Board of Directors (page 45) Our board of directors has unanimously: •approved, adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement; •determined the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders; and •recommended that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. Opinion of Our Financial Advisor (page 47 and Annex B) Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC At the February 16, 2022 meeting of the board of directors, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) rendered to the board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated February 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 16, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with Goldman Sachs’ opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference in its entirety. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the board of directors in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of common stock should vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, the Company has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the announcement of the merger agreement, to be approximately $36 million, $1 million of which was payable upon announcement of the merger agreement, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Treatment of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company Warrants, Time-Vested Restricted Stock, Performance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units (page 68) Common Stock The merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of common stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than shares of common stock held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by the Parent Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded common stock”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $25.00 per share, without interest (such per share amount, the “common stock consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded common stock will be automatically retired and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the merger. If we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid or reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the common stock consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock. Preferred Stock The merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of preferred stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than shares of preferred stock held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by the Parent Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded preferred stock”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $1,000.00 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the closing date, with respect thereto, without interest (such per share amount, the “preferred stock 5 consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded preferred stock will be automatically retired and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the merger. Company Warrants Prior to the merger effective time, we will amend the agreements (which we refer to as the “warrant agreements”) governing the outstanding warrants to purchase common stock (which we refer to as “company warrants”) effective as of the merger effective time, such that each holder of a company warrant that is thereafter exercisable, but not exercised as of the merger effective time, shall be entitled, upon exercise, to receive in respect of each share of common stock underlying such company warrant only an amount of cash equal to the difference between the common stock consideration and the exercise price (as set forth in the applicable warrant agreement) for each such share (such per share amount, the “company warrant amount”). Prior to the merger effective time, we will notify the warrant agent in accordance with the warrant agreements (as amended) with respect to the outstanding company warrants that, as of the merger effective time, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than excluded common stock) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the common stock consideration, and that the terms of the company warrants will be adjusted so that the holder of any company warrant exercised after such date shall be entitled to receive in cash the company warrant amount only with respect to each share of common stock underlying such company warrant immediately prior to the merger effective time. Time-Vested Restricted Stock The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of unvested time-vested restricted common stock (which we refer to as a “time-vested restricted stock”) granted pursuant to the Company’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan or the Company’s 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (which we refer to collectively as the “long-term incentive plans”) will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive the common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Performance Stock Units The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding award of unvested performance-based restricted stock unit (which we refer to as a “performance stock unit”) granted pursuant to the long-term incentive plans, which remains subject to vesting based all or in part on future achievement of performance goals, will become earned and vested with respect to that number of shares of common stock subject to such performance stock unit in accordance with the terms of such performance stock unit (but without applying any pro-ration for the number of days of employment during the shortened performance period ending on the closing date) based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals set forth in the award agreement governing such performance stock unit (as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors) as measured from the beginning of the applicable performance period through the closing date (or the latest practicable date prior thereto that performance can be assessed) (each such earned performance stock unit, and each other outstanding performance stock unit for which the applicable performance period completed prior to the closing date but which remains subject to service vesting conditions, an “earned PSU”). At the merger effective time, each earned PSU will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment withholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned PSU. Additionally, in no event later than five business days after the merger effective time or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code, we will pay to each holder of earned PSUs an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes. Each performance stock unit that does not become an earned PSU will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time. Restricted Stock Units The merger agreement provides that (1) each restricted stock unit that vests upon the satisfaction of service conditions and becomes earned based on our market capitalization increases relevant to target market thresholds (which we refer to as a “market cap restricted stock unit”) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time and that is a vested market cap restricted stock unit that becomes an “Earned RSU” (as defined in the award agreement governing such market cap restricted stock unit) prior to the merger effective time (which we refer to as an “earned RSU”), and (2) each restricted stock unit subject to a service-based vesting requirement granted under the long-term incentive plans (which we refer to as a “time-vested RSU” and, together with the time-vested restricted stock, the performance stock units and market cap restricted stock units, the “compensatory awards”) (whether vested or unvested) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time, will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment withholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned RSU or time- 6 vested RSU (as applicable). Any issued and outstanding market cap restricted stock unit that is not an earned RSU as of immediately prior to the merger effective time will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time. Treatment of Interests in the Partnership (page 69) Class A Partnership Units The merger agreement provides that, at the partnership merger effective time, each Class A unit of the Partnership, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than Class A partnership units held by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or by Parent, Merger Sub II or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded Class A partnership units”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock consideration, without interest (such per unit amount, the “partnership unit consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Class A partnership units, general partnership interests in the Partnership, and Series A redeemable preferred units of the Partnership, Series A1 redeemable preferred units of the Partnership, Series M redeemable preferred units of the Partnership and Series M1 redeemable preferred units of the Partnership (which we refer to collectively as “preferred partnership units”), in each case, held by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company will be unaffected by the partnership merger and will remain outstanding as partnership units of the Surviving Partnership held by the Company or the relevant wholly owned subsidiary. Class A partnership units and preferred partnership units held by Parent, Merger Sub II or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the partnership merger. As discussed above, if we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, or to avoid or reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the partnership unit consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock. Class B Partnership Units The merger agreement provides that each vested Class B Unit of the Partnership, which we refer to as the “Class B partnership units,” or fraction thereof, that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time that becomes an “Earned Class B Unit” (pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement) and which has a “Capital Account” (as defined in the partnership agreement (as defined below)) equal to the “Average Capital Account Balance” (as defined in the partnership agreement) (taking into account any allocations that would be deemed to occur pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement) will automatically be converted into a Class A partnership unit at the partnership merger effective time. Pursuant to the award agreements, all of the Class B partnership units became Earned Class B Units and converted into Class A partnership units on March 31, 2022, and as such, the provisions in the merger agreement applicable to the conversion of unvested Class B partnership units no longer apply. This proxy statement does not constitute any solicitation of consents in respect of the partnership merger, and does not constitute an offer to exchange the Class A partnership units. Treatment of Interests in Operations (page 70) The merger agreement provides that, at the operations merger effective time, each preferred share of Operations (which we refer to as “operations preferred shares”) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the operations merger effective time (other than operations preferred shares held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by the Parent Parties or any of their subsidiaries (collectively, “excluded operations preferred shares” and, together with excluded common stock, excluded preferred stock and excluded Class A partnership units, the “excluded securities”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $1,100.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the closing date, with respect thereto (such per share amount, the “operations preferred share consideration” and, together with the common stock consideration, the preferred stock consideration and the partnership unit consideration, the “merger consideration”), less any applicable withholding taxes. Each common share of Operations held by any person and each excluded operations preferred share will be automatically retired and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the operations merger. This proxy statement does not constitute any solicitation of consents in respect of the operations merger. 7 Financing (page 54) In connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $3.5 billion to be paid to the holders of common stock (assuming the cash exercise of all outstanding company warrants), preferred stock, time- vested restricted stock, earned PSUs, earned RSUs, time-vested RSUs, Class A partnership units and operations preferred shares (in each case other than excluded securities). Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent expects to cause the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, if any, to be repaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans to be repaid or remain outstanding. As of April 11, 2022 we had no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and as of March 31, 2022 we had approximately $2.4 billion in mortgage loans outstanding. Parent has informed us that it currently intends to pursue obtaining debt financing to be provided in connection with the mergers. In addition, it is expected that BREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Sponsor”), which is the operating partnership of BREIT, and its affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt financing. Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and expenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the potential debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned by us, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings. The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the mergers. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide, all customary cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in connection with the arrangement of debt financing with respect to us or our subsidiaries, or our or our subsidiaries’ real property. For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement-Financing Cooperation” and “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Mergers.” Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (page 54) Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. See “The Mergers-Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” for information about interests that our directors and executive officers have in the mergers that are different than yours. Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals (page 80) The “Go-Shop” Period: Solicitation of Competing Proposals Until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 18, 2022 (which we refer to as the “no-shop period start date”), we and our subsidiaries and representatives had the right to solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiry (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals”) that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a competing proposal (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Stockholders’ Meeting”), including by providing non-public information regarding the Company to any person pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, subject to certain other requirements, and engage in any discussions or negotiations with any persons and their respective representatives with respect to a competing proposal or potential competing proposal or interest or potential interest with respect thereto, or otherwise cooperate with, assist or participate in, or facilitate any inquiries. Within one business day after the no-shop period start date, we were required to notify Parent of the identity of each person from whom we received a competing proposal during such period, including any excluded parties (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals”), and provide Parent with a copy of such competing proposal and any other written terms or proposals. The “No-Shop” Period: No Solicitation of Competing Proposals Under the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the no-shop period start date, other than as permitted with respect to excluded parties (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals”), we and our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on our ability to solicit any competing proposal or inquiry, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage, provide any non-public information or take any other action for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or 8 negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry, or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals”), or resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, we may participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, and furnish information (including non-public information) to, any person that has made, renewed or delivered to us a bona fide written competing proposal after the date of the merger agreement and prior to obtaining the stockholder approval (that did not result from a breach of our obligations described in the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals” and “The Merger Agreement-Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation”), if our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such competing proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals”). Under certain circumstances and after following certain procedures and adhering to certain restrictions, we are permitted to terminate the merger agreement if our board of directors approves, and substantially concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement, we enter into an alternative acquisition agreement providing for the implementation of a superior proposal (provided that such termination will not be effective until we have paid the company termination payment (as described below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Payments-Company Termination Payment”)).

Termination Payments (page 92) Company Termination Payment We have agreed to pay Parent the termination payment of $80 million (the “company termination payment”), if: •Parent terminates the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in the second bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement-Termination by Parent”; •we terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in the second bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement-Termination by the Company”; or •all of the following requirements are satisfied: ◦we or Parent terminates the merger agreement pursuant to the provisions described in the first bullet or the third bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement-Termination by Either the Company or Parent” or Parent terminates the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in the first bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement-Termination by Parent”; and ◦(1) a competing proposal has been received by us or our representatives or any person has publicly proposed or made (or publicly announced an intention, whether or not conditional, to make) a competing proposal (and, in the case of a termination pursuant to the provision described in the third bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement- Termination of the Merger Agreement-Termination by Either the Company or 1 1 Parent,” such competing proposal or publicly proposed or announced intention was made prior to the special meeting) and (2) within 12 months following such termination referred to in the immediately preceding sub-bullet, we enter into a definitive written agreement providing for the implementation of any competing proposal or any competing proposal is consummated (provided, that for purposes of this sub-bullet, each reference to 15% in the definition of “competing proposal” will be increased to 50%).

No Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal (page 95) We are organized as a corporation under Maryland law. Because our common stock was listed on the NYSE on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting, our common stockholders who object to the merger do not have any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder under the Maryland General Corporation Law in connection with the merger.

Relying on those allegations, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff’s costs and attorney’s fees. The Wang Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company’s directors. Like the Stein Lawsuit, the Wang Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Wang Lawsuit contains substantially the same allegations as the Stein Lawsuit and seeks substantially the same relief as the Stein Lawsuit. The Anderson Lawsuit, like the Stein Lawsuit and Wang Lawsuit, names as defendants the Company and the Company’s directors. The Anderson Lawsuit also asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Anderson Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs’ analysis, the Company’s nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties, and details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company’s officers and directors. The Anderson Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, a declaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff’s costs and attorney’s fees. The Hopkins Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and its directors. The Hopkins Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs’ analysis, the Company’s nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties, information relating to the Company’s engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., and details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company’s officers and directors. The Hopkins Lawsuit also alleges that the Company’s officers stand to benefit from the merger and that the price of the merger is unfair. Relying on those allegations, the Hopkins Lawsuit asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duties against the directors and a claim for declaratory and equitable relief against all defendants. The Ferguson Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and its directors. The Ferguson Lawsuit, like the Stein, Wang, and Anderson Lawsuits, asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Ferguson Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including the powers and composition of the Transaction Committee (as defined below), certain financial projections and metrics, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs’ analysis, information relating to the Company’s engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., the Company’s nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties, and details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company’s officers and directors. The Ferguson Lawsuit also alleges that the proxy statement fails to disclose the value of company options, restricted stock units, and other equity awards that Company directors, officers, and employees will receive in the proposed merger. The Ferguson Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff’s costs and attorney’s fees. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and could delay or prevent the mergers from becoming effective in a timely manner. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend against these actions vigorously.

These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by reference, including the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. Q: What is the proposed transaction? A: The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Partnership and Operations, by affiliates of Blackstone pursuant to the merger agreement. After the merger proposal has been approved by our common stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub II will be merged with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the Surviving Partnership. Immediately following the partnership merger effective time, Operations will be merged with and into Merger Sub III, with Merger Sub III continuing as the Surviving Operations Entity. Immediately following the operations merger effective time, Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. will be merged with and into Merger Sub I, with Merger Sub I continuing as the Surviving Company. The mergers will occur at the times provided in the merger agreement. For additional information about the mergers, please review the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document governing the mergers. Q: As a common stockholder, what will I receive in the merger? A: For each outstanding share of common stock that you own immediately prior to the merger effective time, you will receive $25.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Q: Will I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the common stock that I own? A: On February 24, 2022, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share of common stock, which will be paid on April 14, 2022 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2022. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we may not authorize, declare or pay any other dividends to the holders of shares of our common stock for subsequent fiscal quarters, without the prior written consent of Parent, other than dividends determined in good faith to be required to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid or reduce the payment of income or excise tax (with any such additional required dividend resulting in a corresponding decrease to the common stock consideration). Q: What will happen to my outstanding company warrants in the mergers? A: The outstanding company warrants will remain outstanding following the merger effective time in accordance with their terms, but the terms of the warrant agreements with respect to the company warrants will be adjusted so that the holder of any company warrant exercised after the merger effective time will be entitled to receive in cash in respect of each share of common stock underlying such company warrant immediately prior to the merger effective time an amount of cash equal to the difference between the common stock consideration and the exercise price (as defined in the applicable warrant agreement governing such company warrant). Q: What will happen to my time-vested restricted stock, performance stock units, market cap restricted stock units and time-vested RSUs? A: Time-Vested Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of time-vested restricted stock will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights will lapse, and thereafter, all shares of our common stock represented by such shares of time-vested restricted stock will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock consideration (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes). Performance Stock Units. Immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding performance stock unit which remains subject to vesting based all or in part on future achievement of performance goals will become earned and vested with respect to that number of shares of our common stock subject to such performance stock unit in accordance with the terms of such performance stock unit (but without applying any pro- ration for the number of days of employment during the shortened performance period ending on the closing date) based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals as set forth in the award agreement governing such performance stock unit (as determined by the compensation committee of our board of 15",14,15

At the merger effective time, each earned PSU will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock consideration (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes). Additionally, in no event later than five business days after the merger effective time or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code, we will pay to each holder of earned PSUs an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes. Each performance stock unit that does not become an earned PSU will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time. Market Cap Restricted Stock Units and Time-Vested RSUs. Each (1) market cap restricted stock unit issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time that is an earned RSU and (2) each time-vested RSU (whether vested or unvested) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock consideration (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes) for each earned RSU or time-vested RSU. Any issued and outstanding market cap restricted stock unit that is not an earned RSU as of immediately prior to the merger effective time will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time.

A: At the merger effective time, the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the equity compensation plan under the partnership agreement will terminate. Q: When do you expect the mergers to be completed? A: If our common stockholders vote to approve the merger proposal, and assuming that the other conditions to the mergers are satisfied or waived, it is anticipated that the mergers will be completed in the second quarter of 2022. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the mergers will take place on the third business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the mergers described under “The Merger Agreement -  Conditions to the Mergers” (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the closing of the mergers, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing) or at such other date as mutually agreed by Parent and us. For further information regarding the timing of the closing of the mergers, see “The Merger Agreement - Effective Times; Closing Date.” Q: What happens if the mergers are not completed? A: If the merger proposal is not approved by our common stockholders, or if the mergers are not completed for any other reason, our common stockholders will not receive any payment for their common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. will remain a public company, our common stock, preferred stock and company warrants will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, our common stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE and our common stock, preferred stock, time-vested restricted stock, performance stock units, market cap restricted stock units, time-vested RSUs, Class A partnership units, common shares of Operations and operations preferred shares will remain outstanding. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, we will be required to pay Parent the company termination payment. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay us the parent termination payment upon termination of the merger agreement. Q: If the mergers are completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my common stock? A: Following the completion of the merger, your shares of common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the aggregate common stock consideration. Shortly after the mergers are completed, you will receive an instruction letter describing how you may exchange your shares of common stock for the common stock consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the common stock consideration. 16 Q: When and where is the virtual special meeting? A: The virtual special meeting will be held on June 7, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APTS2022SM. Q: Who can vote and attend the virtual special meeting? A: All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on April 11, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. The holders of record of our preferred stock are not entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting. The vote of the holders of our preferred stock is not required to approve any of the proposals at the virtual special meeting and is not being solicited. Q: How do I attend the virtual special meeting? A: The virtual special meeting will be held in a virtual-only format on June 7, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. You will not be able to physically attend the virtual special meeting. To access the virtual meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APTS2022SM. The virtual special meeting will start promptly at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, and online access will begin at 8:45 a.m., Eastern Time. To log in to the virtual meeting, you will be required to enter a control number, included on your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive, which will allow you to participate in the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder as of the record date. Please contact Investor Relations at (770) 635-1284 or email InvestorRelations@pacapts.com if you have any other questions in connection with attending the virtual special meeting. Q: What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the merger proposal? A: Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal. Q: What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the advisory compensation proposal? A: Approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have no effect on the proposal. Q: What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the adjournment proposal? A: Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have no effect on the proposal. Q: Why is my vote important? A: If you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote at the virtual special meeting, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the virtual special meeting. In addition, because the merger proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting, your failure to authorize your proxy or voting instructions or to vote at the virtual special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of the merger proposal. Q: How does the common stock consideration compare to the market price of the Company’s common stock? A: The merger consideration of $25.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 39% over the unaffected closing price of our common stock on February 9, 2022, the last trading day prior to the publishing of a media article reporting that the Company was exploring strategic options including a full or partial sale after receiving 17 inbound interest, and a premium of approximately 60% over the 90-day volume weighted average share price ended February 9, 2022. Q: How does our board of directors recommend that I vote? A: Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. Q: Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the advisory compensation proposal? A: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the “SEC,” has adopted rules that require companies to seek a nonbinding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the merger. Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory compensation proposal? A: The vote to approve the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the mergers. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the mergers are completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. Q: Do any of the Company’s directors and executive officers have any interest in the mergers that is different than mine? A: Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those interests of our stockholders generally. See “The Mergers - Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” for information about interests that our directors and executive officers have in the mergers that are different than yours. Q: What do I need to do now? A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the annexes attached to this proxy statement, please vote your shares or authorize a proxy to vote your shares in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. Holders of our common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned as of the record date. Q: How do I cast my vote? A: If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote at the virtual special meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares at the virtual special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope, or, if you prefer, by following the instructions on your proxy card for telephonic or Internet proxy authorization. If the telephone or Internet option is available to you, we strongly encourage you to use it because it is faster and less costly. Registered stockholders can transmit their voting instructions by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903 or on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. Telephone and Internet voting are available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day immediately prior to the virtual special meeting.

To authorize your proxy by mail, please complete sign, date and mail your proxy card in the envelope provided. Q: How do I cast my vote if my common stock is held of record in “street name”? A: If you own common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, since brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also vote at the virtual special meeting. 18 Q: What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote? A: With respect to the merger proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. With respect to the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Q: How will proxy holders vote my common stock? A: If you properly authorize a proxy prior to the virtual special meeting, your shares will be voted as you direct. If you authorize a proxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting. Q: What happens if I sell my common stock before the virtual special meeting? A: If you held shares of common stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective time, you will retain your right to vote at the virtual special meeting, but not the right to receive the common stock consideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when the merger becomes effective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares you previously owned. Q: Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card? A: Yes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it is exercised by filing with our Corporate Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the foregoing options for changing your vote do not apply and instead you must follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote or you may attend and vote at the virtual special meeting. Q: Is the merger expected to be taxable to me? A: Yes. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock and preferred stock pursuant to the merger is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation of the Company and will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of shares of common stock or preferred stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received with respect to such U.S. holder’s shares of common stock or preferred stock in the merger, and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of the merger will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt of such payments is treated as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs pursuant to the provisions of FIRPTA. See “The Mergers - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences - Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock” and “-Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Shares of Preferred Stock” for further discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to non-U.S. holders. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws). For further discussion, see “The Mergers - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.” Q: What rights do I have if I oppose the merger? A: If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the merger proposal. You are not, however, entitled to exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in connection with the merger. Because shares of our common stock were listed on the NYSE on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting, pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law, our common stockholders who object to the merger do not have any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger. For more information, see “No Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal.” 19 Q: Where can I find the voting results of the virtual special meeting? A: We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the virtual special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the virtual special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov when filed. Q: Can I participate if I am unable to attend the virtual special meeting? A: If you are unable to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet. Q: Have any stockholders already agreed to approve the merger? A: No. To our knowledge, none of our common stockholders have entered into any agreement to vote any of their shares of common stock either in favor or against any proposal at the virtual special meeting. Q: Where can I find more information about the Company? A: We file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.pacapts.com. The information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this proxy statement or any other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC. You can also request copies of these documents from us. For more information, see “Where You Can Find More Information.” Q: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies? A: We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the virtual special meeting. Our board of directors is soliciting your proxy on our behalf. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees. We have engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc., which we refer to as “MacKenzie Partners,” to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $50,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.

Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting is required to approve the merger proposal and for the mergers to occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully in its entirety.

Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the mergers. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. Accordingly, in order for your shares to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must either return the enclosed proxy card, authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet or vote at the virtual special meeting. The vote of the holders of our preferred stock is not required to approve any of the proposals at the virtual special meeting and is not being solicited. As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 1,341,751 shares of our common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 2.09% of the total combined voting power of our common stock at the virtual special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares of our common stock that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so. Votes cast by proxy or at the virtual special meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of election for the virtual special meeting. The inspector of election will also determine the number of shares of common stock represented at the virtual special meeting, virtually or by proxy. How to Authorize a Proxy Holders of record of our common stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of the following methods: •mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail; •authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions included with your proxy card; or •attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Regardless of whether you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares as described above as promptly as possible. Under NYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the virtual special meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the broker, bank or other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if you own common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares following the directions contained in such voting instruction card. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also vote at the virtual special meeting. Because the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. Because the approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal, and because your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is present. Proxies and Revocation If you authorize a proxy, your shares will be voted at the virtual special meeting as you indicate on your proxy. If no instructions are indicated when you authorize your proxy, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors. Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. 29",28,29

If you have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also vote at the virtual special meeting. Because the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. Because the approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal, and because your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is present. Proxies and Revocation If you authorize a proxy, your shares will be voted at the virtual special meeting as you indicate on your proxy. If no instructions are indicated when you authorize your proxy, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors. Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. 29 You may revoke your proxy at any time, but only before the proxy is voted at the virtual special meeting, in any of three ways: •by delivering, prior to the date of the virtual special meeting, a written revocation of your proxy dated after the date of the proxy that is being revoked to our Corporate Secretary at 3284 Northside Parkway NW, Suite 150, Atlanta, Georgia 30327; •by delivering to our Corporate Secretary a later-dated, duly executed proxy or by authorizing your proxy by telephone or by Internet at a date after the date of the previously authorized proxy relating to the same shares of common stock; or •by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy. If you own common stock in “street name,” you may revoke or change previously granted voting instructions by following the instructions provided by the broker, bank or other nominee that is the registered owner of the shares or by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting. Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting. Solicitation of Proxies We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the virtual special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our officers, directors and other employees, for which they will not receive additional compensation. We have engaged MacKenzie Partners to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $50,000, plus reimbursement of out-of- pocket expenses, and we have agreed to indemnify MacKenzie Partners against certain losses, costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations holding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees, that are beneficially owned by others to send or cause to be sent proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners and will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Adjournments Our bylaws permit the chairman of the virtual special meeting, acting in his or her own discretion and without any action by our stockholders, to adjourn the virtual special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present) to a later date and time and at a place announced at the virtual special meeting. In either case, the adjourned meeting may take place without further notice other than by an announcement made at the virtual special meeting unless the adjournment is for more than 120 days after the original record date or if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, including that the virtual special meeting generally may not be held, without Parent’s consent, on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the virtual special meeting was originally scheduled). Postponements At any time prior to convening the virtual special meeting, we may postpone the virtual special meeting for any reason without the approval of our common stockholders to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, including that the virtual special meeting generally may not be held, without Parent’s consent, on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the virtual special meeting was originally scheduled). 30",29,30

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub II will merge with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the Surviving Partnership. Immediately following the partnership merger effective time, Operations will merge with and into Merger Sub III, with Merger Sub III continuing as the Surviving Operations Entity. Immediately following the operations merger effective time, we will merge with and into Merger Sub I, with Merger Sub I continuing as the Surviving Company. This proxy statement does not constitute any solicitation of consents in respect of the partnership merger or the operations merger, and does not constitute an offer to exchange any Class A partnership units. Background of the Mergers Our board of directors regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans and reviews possible ways of increasing long-term stockholder value. As part of these evaluations, our board of directors periodically assesses the Company’s competitive position and actively monitors industry trends, our short- and long-term operating performance, our stock price performance, and potential strategic and financial initiatives. As part of these reviews, our board of directors has noted our need to frequently raise capital due to the capital-intensive nature of our business, the cost of obtaining such capital, the substantial amount of our outstanding preferred stock and debt, and challenges in acquiring multifamily properties on an accretive basis in light of low capitalization rates and prices for multifamily residential real estate being at or near historic highs. Based on these evaluations, since 2020 we embarked on a strategy to simplify our business model, lower our capital requirements, reduce leverage, and focus on market segments with higher growth opportunities, which resulted in the internalization of our management, the sale of both our student housing asset class (completed in November 2020) and the significant majority of our office asset class (completed in July- November 2021) and focus on high-quality Sunbelt multifamily assets. The closing price of our common stock on September 24, 2020, the date we announced the sale of our student housing asset class, was $5.40 per share of common stock. The divestitures of our student housing and the office property assets in particular provided the Company with capital to use towards asset acquisitions and real estate loan investments in support of suburban multifamily communities in the Sunbelt region, and the redemption of approximately $660 million of our preferred stock. From time to time, representatives of the Company, including Joel Murphy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, have met with executives of other companies in the real estate industry, including Blackstone, to discuss industry developments and possible opportunities for transactions. On November 5, 2021, Jacob Werner, Co-Head of Americas Acquisitions for Blackstone Real Estate, contacted Mr. Murphy indicating that Mr. Werner was going to be in Atlanta the following week and inquired as to whether Mr. Murphy had some time to catch-up. Mr. Murphy had planned to be in New York at the end of that week and suggested they meet at such time. On November 11, Messrs. Murphy and Werner had breakfast during which Mr. Werner stated that Blackstone was impressed with the Company and its Sunbelt platform and that Blackstone would like to explore a potential acquisition of the Company. He indicated that, based on its review of publicly available information, Blackstone believed it could acquire the Company at a significant premium to the Company’s current stock price. No specific terms of a potential transaction were discussed. Following the breakfast, Mr. Murphy telephoned Mr. McLure, our lead independent director, and the Company’s outside counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP (“V&E”), to inform them of this conversation. On November 10, 2021, the closing price of our common stock was $13.87 per share. On November 22, 2021, Mr. Werner contacted Mr. Murphy and requested a time to follow up on their prior conversation. Mr. Murphy suggested waiting until after Thanksgiving. Mr. Murphy informed Mr. McLure and V&E of this outreach and, with the approval of Mr. McLure, called Goldman Sachs for advice. Mr. Murphy contacted Goldman Sachs based on its knowledge of and experience with the Company in light of having regularly advised us on a range of matters, including the sale of our office assets during 2021 and capital markets generally. On December 6, 2021, Mr. Werner asked Mr. Murphy whether he would be available to meet in Atlanta the next day. Mr. Murphy apprised Mr. McLure and representatives of V&E and Goldman Sachs of this request, and Mr. McLure authorized Mr. Murphy to meet with Mr. Werner. 31",30,31

He requested that the Company enter into a confidentiality agreement and provide non-public information in order for Blackstone to learn more about the Company so that it could provide a more specific proposal. Mr. Murphy noted that he was very confident in the Company’s standalone plan and the progress the Company had made over the last two years. Following this meeting, Mr. Murphy updated Mr. McLure and representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and King & Spalding LLP (“K&S”), outside counsel for the Company. Mr. Murphy asked Goldman Sachs to prepare preliminary financial analyses to assist our board of directors in deciding whether to pursue a potential transaction with Blackstone. On December 6, 2021, the closing price of the our common stock was $13.56 per share. On December 10, 2021, during a previously scheduled board of directors meeting, which was attended by John Isakson, our Chief Financial Officer, and a representative of V&E, Mr. Murphy summarized his discussions with Mr. Werner. The directors and Mr. Isakson discussed Blackstone’s desire to enter into a confidentiality agreement in order to review non-public information, as well as process and timing considerations if we were to engage in discussions with Blackstone, including the benefits and risks of reaching out to other potential acquirers. Following this discussion, the directors unanimously agreed that the best course of action would be to seek Goldman Sachs’ financial advice regarding a potential sale of the Company, as well as its views as to the best process to explore a sale, and other potential strategic alternatives for the Company. On December 15, 2021, as directed by our board of directors, Mr. Murphy contacted Mr. Werner to inform him that the Company was considering Blackstone’s interest in a transaction and would respond once our board of directors had decided how it would like to proceed, which would not be until after the first of the year. On December 20, 2021, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S in attendance. A representative of V&E reviewed the directors’ duties under Maryland law in connection with a potential acquisition of the Company and provided an overview of a typical process for a public company merger transaction. The directors engaged in a discussion with Goldman Sachs regarding, among other things, Blackstone’s historical capital raising activities and available capital, Blackstone’s interest in multifamily properties located in the Sunbelt region as evidenced by Blackstone’s agreement to acquire Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (“Bluerock”) announced earlier that day, the price Blackstone agreed to pay in the Bluerock transaction and the impact of such transaction on the price of our common stock, the potential treatment of our preferred stock in a transaction with Blackstone and whether the amount of preferred stock outstanding and leverage could impact the price per common share at which Blackstone might be willing to acquire the Company. After discussion, our board of directors requested that Goldman Sachs prepare a preliminary financial analysis of the Company and continue to analyze Blackstone’s potential interest in a transaction and other strategic alternatives for discussion at the next board of directors meeting. Following the board of directors meeting on December 20, 2021, the Company received a notice (the “nomination notice”) from Arkhouse Securities LLC and its affiliates Arkhouse Securities II and Arkhouse Partners LLC (collectively, “Arkhouse”) setting forth Arkhouse’s desire to replace five of the eight directors on the Company’s board of directors with five of its own named nominees and effectively obtain control of the Company through its nominees. Our board of directors was made aware of the nominations. Arkhouse’s outside counsel stated in the correspondence accompanying the nomination notice that Arkhouse intended to engage privately and constructively with the Company regarding its thoughts on opportunities to enhance value for our stockholders, but did not provide any detail on these opportunities. V&E initiated several phone calls and correspondence with Arkhouse’s outside counsel in December 2021 and January 2022 to determine the reason Arkhouse believed it needed to make nominations related to the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) and to schedule an initial meeting between the Company and Arkhouse. Given the deadline of December 22, 2021 for nominating directors for the Annual Meeting as set out in the Company’s proxy statement for its 2021 annual meeting, outside counsel for Arkhouse confirmed to V&E that Arkhouse had made nominations to retain optionality if it later believed it would be necessary to contest the election of five directors at the Annual Meeting. Arkhouse’s outside counsel did not express any underlying grievance or criticisms Arkhouse may have had that played any role in it submitting nominations. 32 On December 31, 2021, after the close of trading on the NYSE, Reuters published an article reporting that Arkhouse was seeking to take control of the Company and had nominated five individuals to serve as directors (the “Reuters Article”). On December 31, 2021, the closing price of our common stock was $18.06 per share. On January 5, 2022, Mr. Werner contacted a representative of Goldman Sachs to reiterate Blackstone’s interest in exploring a transaction with the Company, but did not provide any specific terms. On January 21, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S in attendance. Mr. Murphy summarized the work that our management team and Goldman Sachs had performed regarding various strategic alternatives for the Company. A representative of V&E reviewed the directors’ duties under Maryland law in connection with a potential acquisition of the Company. Our management then reviewed and discussed with our board of directors a preliminary draft of our five-year projections for 2022 through 2026 and the assumptions used to prepare such projections. Representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with our board of directors their preliminary financial analysis of the Company as well as other strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company, including remaining a standalone independent public company or selling certain or all of our grocery-anchored retail assets. A discussion ensued among the directors, management, our outside counsel and financial advisor regarding, among other things, the benefits and risks related to each of the potential strategic alternatives; indicative capitalization rates from recent transactions in the REIT industry; the substantial amount of our preferred stock and debt, including significant property level debt; our need to frequently raise capital due to the capital-intensive nature of our business; the cost of obtaining capital; and challenges of acquiring multifamily properties on an accretive basis in the current environment. Our board of directors also discussed with management and our advisors the benefits and risks of to the Company and its business posed by contacting other potential bidders before announcing any transaction and the best process for maximizing stockholder value if the Company were to be sold. These potential risks and considerations included the fact that Blackstone might be able to realize more value from the business than other potential acquirers and thereby pay a higher price to acquire the Company due to, among other reasons, Blackstone’s low cost of capital, substantial available capital and interest in multifamily properties located in the Sunbelt region; the limited universe of other potential third parties with the financial ability to acquire the Company without obtaining financing from third parties in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of our common and preferred stock; the fact that the large amount of our preferred stock and debt could negatively impact the price for our common stock that other bidders may be willing to pay; and concerns that soliciting additional potential bidders could result in market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction which would disrupt our business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price volatility. Following this discussion, the directors determined that expediting any transaction process would be important to minimize risks to the Company, protect its business and maximize stockholder value, but that the Company should solicit interest from other potential bidders, either prior to or following signing a definitive merger agreement, in order to maximize shareholder value. After discussion, our board of directors determined to explore a potential transaction with Blackstone and authorized the Company to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Blackstone and provide it with due diligence materials so that Blackstone could provide a proposal with more specific terms. Our board decided that Goldman Sachs should conduct negotiations with Blackstone under the direction of the directors, and instructed Goldman Sachs to inform Blackstone that the Company was prepared to engage on a potential transaction with Blackstone. Our board also directed members of management to refrain from having discussions with Blackstone regarding the roles or compensation, if any, of management following the closing of a negotiated transaction. Following the January 21, 2022 board of directors meeting, our management team prepared an updated version of our five-year projections for 2022 through 2026, reflecting the 2022 budget and 2021 actual data (the “financial projections”), which are discussed in more detail under “-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”. On January 24, 2022, as directed by our board of directors, a representative of Goldman Sachs called Mr. Werner and indicated that our board of directors was interested in continuing discussions regarding the terms of a potential transaction. Mr. Werner indicated that Blackstone expected to pay a meaningful premium to our common stock trading price, but did not provide a specific price or other terms. The representative of Goldman Sachs indicated that our board of directors was considering whether, if discussions with Blackstone progressed, to contact additional potential bidders prior to entering into any transaction. Mr. Werner indicated that Blackstone was not 33 interested in participating in a pre-signing market check. Its willingness to pay a meaningful premium assumed the Company would not be concurrently negotiating with other parties. The Company would, however, be able to solicit other bids during a post-signing “go-shop” period where there would be a low termination fee payable if the Company accepted another bid. On January 24, 2022, Blackstone announced its agreement to acquire Resource REIT, Inc. (“Resource”) for $14.75 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $3.7 billion. Resource owns various multifamily properties located in the Sunbelt region. On January 26, 2022, Mr. Isakson, Paul Cullen, the Company’s Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, and Gavriel Kahane, the chief executive officer of Arkhouse, met by videoconference to discuss Arkhouse’s intentions with respect to the Company. During the conversation, Mr. Kahane noted that he believed that the Company was too small, had too much preferred stock and debt, should consider selling its grocery-anchored retail assets and use the proceeds to redeem outstanding preferred stock, and should broaden its public disclosure. Mr. Kahane acknowledged that the Company had already made substantial progress on several of these initiatives. Mr. Kahane stated that if ongoing conversations with the Company were constructive that Arkhouse may withdraw its board nominations. On January 30, 2022, Blackstone entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company, which contained a customary “standstill” provision that prevented Blackstone from, among other things, making a proposal with respect to an acquisition of the Company except on a confidential basis to the Company. Thereafter, on January 31, 2022, we opened a virtual data room and thereafter Blackstone engaged in due diligence. Throughout January and until the merger agreement was signed, representatives of Goldman Sachs had multiple discussions with representatives of Blackstone regarding its due diligence review of the Company and its business. On February 2, 2022, Mr. Cullen emailed Mr. Kahane to schedule a meeting on February 15, 2022 between Messrs. Murphy, Isakson, Cullen and Kahane to follow up on the matters discussed on January 26, 2022; however, the Company requested to reschedule the meeting on February 14, 2022 due to some personal conflicts that arose shortly before the meeting. On February 6, 2022, Mr. Werner notified a representative of Goldman Sachs that Blackstone intended to provide a proposal later that week or early the following week. Also during the week of February 7, 2022, following a request by Blackstone, Blackstone conducted site visits. On February 8, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs received telephonic inquiries from a large private investment firm primarily focused on global real estate (“Party A”) and a publicly traded REIT that owns multifamily communities (“Party B”). Each of those inquiries indicated a general interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company, but did not include any specific terms. Goldman Sachs notified our management and outside counsel of these inquiries shortly thereafter, and Mr. Murphy subsequently informed Mr. McLure. The Company determined not to respond to these inquiries until our board of directors had an opportunity to consider them and the Company’s response. On February 9, 2022, representatives of Blackstone, our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs participated in a due diligence call. On February 9, 2022, after the close of trading on the NYSE, Bloomberg News published an article reporting that the Company was exploring options including a full or partial sale after receiving inbound interest from potential acquirors (the “Bloomberg Article”). On February 9, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $17.96 per share. Later in the day on February 9, 2022, a representative of the Company received an email from a representative of Party A indicating an interest in any strategic alternatives that the Company might be exploring. Party A did not provide any specific terms of a potential transaction. Mr. Murphy notified Mr. McLure of the email from Party A. The Company determined not to respond to this email until our board of directors had an opportunity to consider the recent inquiries and the Company’s response. On February 10, 2022, representatives of Blackstone called representatives of Goldman Sachs and indicated that Blackstone had substantially completed its business due diligence and would like to acquire the Company at a proposed purchase price of $23.50 per share of common stock in cash (representing an approximate 31% premium 34 to the $17.96 per share unaffected closing price of our common stock on February 9, 2022, the date of the Bloomberg Article, and a 36% premium to the trailing 30-day volume weighted average trading price (or VWAP) through such date). The proposal assumed that the Company would declare only one additional quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share of common stock prior to closing. Mr. Werner noted that Blackstone had received all necessary internal approvals to make its proposal, would proceed without any financing contingency and was prepared to move quickly to complete its confirmatory due diligence and negotiate and finalize a merger agreement as soon as February 14, 2022. Mr. Werner indicated that Blackstone’s proposal assumed there would not be a pre-signing market check. He offered the Company a go-shop provision, which would permit the Company to solicit alternative proposals during the 30-day period following the signing of a merger agreement. The go-shop would be paired with a lower termination fee (equal to 1.7% of the value of our common and preferred stock (approximately $52 million)) payable if we terminated the merger agreement to enter into a superior transaction with a party making a proposal during the go-shop period and a higher termination fee (equal to 3.25% of the value of our common and preferred stock (approximately $100 million)) thereafter, along with matching rights if any superior proposal were received. Blackstone’s proposal also contemplated a reverse termination fee of 9% of the value of our common and preferred stock (approximately $275 million) payable by Blackstone in certain circumstances as an exclusive remedy with no right for the Company to obtain specific performance. In order to move expeditiously given the Bloomberg Article, Mr. Werner conveyed that Blackstone was prepared to use the fully negotiated agreement from Blackstone’s recently announced acquisition of Resource as a precedent agreement for the proposed transaction with the Company. The representative of Goldman Sachs informed Mr. Werner that the Company would revert after discussing the proposal with our board of directors. Also on February 10, 2022, Mr. Murphy received a text message from a representative of a publicly traded REIT that owns multifamily communities (“Party C”) indicating that Party C would be interested in learning more from the Company. No specific terms were provided. Mr. Murphy subsequently briefed Mr. McLure regarding both Blackstone’s indication of interest and the communication from Party C. The Company determined not to respond to the text message from Party C until our board of directors had an opportunity to consider the recent inquiries and the Company’s response. On February 11, 2022, our board of directors was provided a letter from Goldman Sachs with respect to certain relationships with Blackstone, which we refer to as the “Goldman Sachs Disclosure Letter”. On February 12, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of our management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S in attendance. During the meeting, representatives of V&E reviewed the directors’ duties under Maryland law in connection with a potential acquisition of the Company, and our board of directors received an update from representatives of Goldman Sachs on the discussions with Blackstone since the last meeting of our board of directors on January 21, 2022 and the inquiries from Party A, Party B and Party C. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and K&S described the terms of Blackstone’s proposal. Our management team also reviewed with our board of directors the financial projections. Representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with our board of directors their preliminary financial analysis of the Company, as well as Goldman Sachs’ review of strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company, including remaining as an independent public company or selling certain or all of our grocery-anchored retail assets. A discussion ensued among the directors, management, our outside counsel and financial advisor regarding, among other things: risks and considerations related to each of the strategic alternatives; opportunities to grow our business, improve leverage and become more profitable; challenges that we face and that could arise in the future; the cost of obtaining capital; reasons why Blackstone might be able to realize more value from the business than another bidder and thereby pay a higher price to acquire the Company, including Blackstone’s low cost of capital, substantial available capital and interest in multifamily properties located in the Sunbelt region; and amount of capital needed to acquire all of our common and preferred stock for cash. Our board of directors discussed with management and our advisors the best process for maximizing stockholder value if the Company were to be sold, including whether a competitive bidding process would yield a higher price than Blackstone’s proposal with a go-shop provision, as well as benefits and risks to the Company and its business posed by engaging with Party A, Party B or Party C or contacting other potential bidders before announcing any transaction, including the risk that engaging with or contacting other potential bidders prior to signing a definitive agreement with Blackstone could jeopardize the availability of Blackstone’s proposal. Our board of directors also discussed with its advisors the benefits of a “go- shop” provision that would permit the Company to 35 entertain potentially superior proposals from other bidders while having a binding contract with Blackstone in the event that a merger agreement was ultimately executed with Blackstone and the impact that the reduced company termination fee during the go-shop period proposed by Blackstone might have on other interested parties and their willingness to submit a superior proposal. Our board of directors also discussed with management and our advisors other potential risks and considerations that included: the limited universe of potential third parties with the financial ability to acquire the Company in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of our common and preferred stock without obtaining financing from third parties; concerns about the recent media reports and rumors that the Company was exploring a possible partial or full sale of the company disrupting our business relationships and risking employee turnover; and indicative capitalization rates from recent transactions in the REIT industry. The directors unanimously agreed that the transaction process should be expedited to minimize risks to the Company, protect its business and maximize stockholder value and determined to further discuss next steps the following day. On February 13, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of our management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S in attendance. The directors discussed strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company other than a sale of the Company, including a sale of its grocery-anchored retail assets and remaining an independent public company, and risks and considerations related to each. Our board of directors concluded that it was not in the best interests of the Company or our stockholders to pursue any of the strategic alternatives other than continuing to consider the Blackstone proposal or remaining an independent public company. Our board of directors next discussed with management and our advisors, among other items, the Company’s financial projections, the Company’s recent share price and the premia of the Blackstone proposal to various Company common stock prices, as further described in the section entitled “-Opinion of Our Financial Advisor- Summary of Financial Analyses”, FFO trading multiples of comparable multifamily and retail public REITs, potential future Company common stock prices based on these multiples and the financial projections, the present value of potential future stock prices and dividends compared to the Blackstone proposal, including how different assumptions affected such potential future Company common stock prices and the present value of potential future stock prices and dividends, and other financial matters related to the Company. Our board of directors also discussed with its advisors an illustrative timeline if it were to proceed with further discussions with Blackstone. After discussing the terms of Blackstone’s proposal and various potential responses, our board of directors unanimously agreed that it was in the best interests of the Company to continue discussions with Blackstone. Our board of directors then discussed the best process for maximizing stockholder value if the Company were to be sold, including whether to first solicit additional potential bidders or sign a merger agreement with Blackstone that included a go-shop provision. Our board of directors further discussed the benefits of a “go-shop” provision that would permit the Company to entertain potentially superior proposals from other bidders in an orderly process while having a binding contract with Blackstone and determined that a “go-shop” provision could be beneficial so long as the termination fee during the go-shop period was sufficiently low so as not to deter other bidders. Our board of directors also noted that Party A, Party B and Party C had not indicated that they had done any work analyzing a transaction at that point, and on the other hand, Blackstone had completed its due diligence and was prepared to sign a merger agreement within the next few days if the parties could agree to terms of the transaction. Our board of directors discussed with our advisors the likelihood of Party A, Party B and Party C submitting a proposal with better terms than the terms of Blackstone’s proposal, timing considerations relating to such possible proposals and the terms thereof including the potential form of consideration and the likelihood of a financing contingency. The directors also discussed that engaging with Party A, Party B or Party C, or soliciting additional potential bidders, could result in Blackstone changing the terms in its proposal or electing to disengage from negotiations for a potential transaction in light of Blackstone’s stated unwillingness to participate in a pre-signing market check. Our board of directors unanimously agreed that it would not be in the best interests of the Company to pause discussions with Blackstone to allow time to engage with Party A, Party B or Party C or solicit additional potential bidders so long as any potential deal with Blackstone included a post-signing go-shop with a low termination fee. As a result, our board of directors determined that Mr. Murphy and representatives of the Company should not contact Party A, Party B or Party C until the Company had entered into a binding merger agreement with Blackstone containing a go-shop provision and low termination fees. Following further discussion, our board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue to engage in discussions with Blackstone and directed a representative of Goldman Sachs to present Blackstone with a counterproposal on the following terms: a purchase price of $25.00 per share of common stock in cash (representing an approximate 39% premium to the $17.96 per share unaffected closing price of our common stock on February 9, 2022, the date of the Bloomberg Article, and an approximate 41% premium to 36 the trailing 30-day VWAP through such date); the Company would have the right to declare only one additional quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share of the common stock prior to closing of the transaction; a 30-day “go-shop” provision with a two-tier termination fee consisting of a termination fee of $25 million (equal to 0.5% of the Company’s enterprise value) if the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal in connection with the go-shop and a termination fee of $50 million (equal to 0.9% of the Company’s enterprise value) thereafter; and a reverse termination fee of $300 million equal to 5.4% of the Company’s enterprise value) payable by Blackstone in certain circumstances as an exclusive remedy and no right for the Company to obtain specific performance. Given the recent media reports and market rumors that the Company was exploring a possible partial or full sale of the company, the directors continued to be of the view that expediting the transaction process would be critical to minimizing risks to the Company and protecting its business and maximizing stockholder value. Mr. McLure, as our lead independent director, noted that our board of directors needed to understand Blackstone’s thoughts about retaining the Company platform and employees in connection with finalizing a transaction, assuming that the Company and Blackstone could agree to the price and other material terms of the transaction. The directors unanimously agreed that, if the transaction progressed, Mr. McLure should discuss Blackstone’s intentions. The directors and a representative of V&E also discussed options to handle future negotiations with Blackstone given the pace of the transaction. Our board of directors also discussed the interests of our directors and executive officers in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally, as discussed under “-Interests of our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers”. Following this discussion, our board of directors formed a committee of directors consisting of Mr. Murphy as well as independent directors Mr. McLure, John Cannon, Sara Finley and Tim Peterson (the “Transaction Committee”) in order to expeditiously evaluate and handle future negotiations with Blackstone. During this February 13, 2022 meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs described its qualifications and experience with these types of transactions. Following the departure of the Goldman Sachs representatives from the meeting, our board of directors discussed with management and representatives of V&E and K&S the contemplated engagement of Goldman Sachs as our financial advisor, Goldman Sachs’ relationships with Blackstone and the fees to be paid to Goldman Sachs in connection with their engagement. After considering the overall reputation, experience and qualifications of Goldman Sachs, as well as Goldman Sachs’ knowledge of multifamily and retail property asset classes and broader real estate market and the Company’s business and properties in particular, and information provided by Goldman Sachs in the Goldman Sachs Disclosure Letter as discussed under “- Opinions of Our Financial Advisors,” our board of directors unanimously approved the engagement of Goldman Sachs as our financial advisor with respect to a potential sale of the Company and authorized management and our outside counsel to finalize the engagement letter with Goldman Sachs. On February 13, 2022, as directed by our board of directors, representatives of Goldman Sachs orally communicated to representatives of Blackstone our counterproposal. Later that day, Blackstone’s outside counsel, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (“Simpson Thacher”), sent to our outside counsel, K&S and V&E, drafts of a merger agreement, limited guaranty and equity commitment letter. The draft merger agreement contemplated that, among other things: the Company would merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Blackstone and another wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Blackstone would merge with and into the Partnership, with the respective holders of shares of the Company’s common stock and units in the Partnership to receive the same cash consideration; the Company would be able to solicit proposals during a 30-day go-shop period with the ability to continue to negotiate during the subsequent 10-day period with a bidder who made a qualified proposal during the go-shop period; and, subject to certain exceptions, the Company would be permitted flexibility to continue to operate in the ordinary course of business prior to closing. Between February 13, 2022 and February 15, 2022, we, with the assistance of K&S and V&E, and Blackstone, with the assistance of Simpson Thacher, negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related documentation. The negotiations covered various aspects of the transaction, including, among other things: the treatment the preferred stock and warrants, the representations and warranties to be made by the parties, the restriction on the conduct of the Company’s business until completion of the transaction, the conditions to completion of the mergers, our ability to participate in discussions and negotiations with third parties relating to unsolicited proposals, the right of our board of directors to change its recommendation that stockholders approve the merger in response to a superior proposal or otherwise, our right to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal under certain conditions, the other termination provisions and the triggers of the termination fee payable by us, and the 37 provisions regarding our equity awards, employee benefit plans, retention, severance and other compensation matters. Blackstone also continued to complete its confirmatory due diligence. On February 14, 2022, Mr. Werner orally communicated a revised proposal to a representative of Goldman Sachs. Blackstone accepted the Company’s February 13, 2022 proposal, except that the termination fee payable by the Company would be $100 million (rather than $50 million as the Company had proposed) if the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal after the 30-day go-shop period (or the subsequent 10-day period to enter into a superior proposal with a bidder who made a qualified proposal during the go-shop period). Blackstone also reiterated that it expected the parties to work expeditiously and expressed its desire to sign a merger agreement by 8:00 a.m. on February 16, 2022. Later in the day on February 14, 2022, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S. A representative of Goldman Sachs reviewed Blackstone’s proposal with the Transaction Committee, noting that Blackstone assumed that the Company would not contact other parties prior to signing a merger agreement with Blackstone. The Transaction Committee discussed the terms of Blackstone’s latest proposal and unanimously agreed to respond by requesting a lower termination fee of $80 million (rather than Blackstone’s proposed $100 million) payable by the Company if the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal after the expiration of the 30-day go-shop period (or the subsequent 10-day period to enter into a superior proposal with a bidder who made a qualified proposal during the go-shop period). Following the meeting, at the direction of the Transaction Committee, a representative of Goldman Sachs orally communicated our counterproposal to Blackstone, which Blackstone accepted. With the parties having agreed upon the purchase price and the other material terms of the proposed transaction, Mr. McLure and Ms. Finley discussed with Mr. Werner Blackstone’s general thoughts on the Company’s platform and employees. During this discussion, Mr. Werner articulated that Blackstone was impressed by the Company’s platform, including the Company’s people and processes, and that the platform was an important consideration in determining to acquire the Company. No specific employees or employment terms were discussed. Later on February 14, 2022, a representative of Party A sent an email to Goldman Sachs indicating an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company without specifying any terms. Goldman Sachs notified our management and outside counsel of this inquiry shortly thereafter and Mr. Murphy informed Mr. McLure of this inquiry that same day. The Company determined to not respond to this email until our board of directors had an opportunity to consider this inquiry and the Company’s response. On February 15, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S in attendance. Mr. McLure and Ms. Finley updated our board of directors regarding their discussion with Blackstone the prior day. A representative of Goldman Sachs updated our board of directors on the changes to the key economic terms in Blackstone’s proposal since the last board of directors meeting and also informed our board of directors about Party A’s inquiry. Our board of directors asked questions and engaged in discussion. A representative of Goldman Sachs presented to our board of directors Goldman Sachs’ preliminary financial analysis of the common stock consideration. A representative of K&S provided a summary of the merger agreement and other transaction documentation and noted that they were substantially complete, and representatives of K&S and V&E noted that it would be possible to sign the merger agreement before the market opened on February 16, 2022. Around 10:30 p.m. on February 15, 2022, Party A sent the Company an unsolicited letter that contained a non-binding proposal from Party A relating to a potential acquisition of the Company by Party A for $29.25 per share of Company common stock, without specifying any additional terms. The letter stated that Party A was ready to confirm its price within five calendar days of receipt of non-public property level and corporate information, and after economic terms were agreed, it would need an unspecified period to complete confirmatory due diligence. While the letter stated that the proposal was not contingent on financing, it indicated that a portion of the funds for the transaction may be provided by an opportunity fund sponsored by Party A. The letter said that Party A was fully authorized to pursue the transaction on the terms of the proposal, but added that it anticipated obtaining final approval from its investment committee upon completion of confirmatory diligence and agreement with the Company on the material transaction terms. Later that evening, the Transaction Committee held a meeting with representatives of our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S to discuss the proposal from Party A. The group reviewed and 38 discussed the potential benefits, risks and other considerations involved in engaging with Party A and potentially other parties prior to entering into a merger agreement with Blackstone, including those discussed at prior meetings of our board of directors, recent geopolitical risks, related market volatility, that Blackstone had completed all of its due diligence, Blackstone and the Company had agreed upon all financial and other material terms of a transaction and were imminently prepared to execute the merger agreement, and that engaging with Party A or other potential bidders could jeopardize the availability of Blackstone’s proposal in light of its stated unwillingness to participate in a pre-signing market check. The Transaction Committee also considered that, if viable, Party A’s proposal exceeded the price per share of the Blackstone transaction, but that Party A’s letter was only a non-binding indication of interest, that Party A had not yet conducted any non-public due diligence on the Company, that Party A indicated it would need five days to confirm its price after it received non-public property level and corporate information and then an unspecified period for confirmatory due diligence, that Party A’s offer was subject to and could be altered upon completion of due diligence, and that it anticipated obtaining final approval from its investment committee upon completion of confirmatory diligence and agreement with the Company on the material transaction terms. The Transaction Committee also discussed that at least a portion of the proceeds associated with the Party A proposal may be sourced from an opportunity fund sponsored by Party A, indicating a higher cost of capital and, as a consequence, that Party A could reduce its price. The Transaction Committee also discussed with our advisors the potential opportunity for the Company to continue soliciting a superior proposal from Party A and other interested parties following the signing of a merger agreement with Blackstone pursuant to the go-shop mechanism. The Transaction Committee believed that the go-shop process would provide Party A and other interested parties the opportunity to conduct due diligence on the Company and make a binding proposal if Party A or any other party desired to do so. In particular, the Transaction Committee observed that the $25 million company termination fee applicable to qualified proposals made during the go-shop period, which represented approximately $0.42 per share of common stock on a fully-diluted basis as of February 16, 2022, was low compared to the size of the proposed transaction with Blackstone, the indication of interest from Party A, and similar transactions involving other public companies, and not likely to preclude or discourage Party A or other interested parties from submitting a superior proposal. The group also discussed the ability for the Company to maintain control through a go-shop process that would allow a market check to maximize shareholder value, the limited universe of potential third parties with the financial ability to acquire the Company in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of our common and preferred stock with no financing contingency and concerns about the recent market leak and rumors that the Company was exploring strategic alternatives including a possible partial or full sale disrupting the Company’s business relationships and risking employee turnover. Following discussion, after considering the certainty represented by Blackstone’s $25.00 per share fully financed proposal, the risk that Blackstone could withdraw or adversely modify its proposal, the fact that Party A may not make a definitive proposal and our directors’ belief that Party A and others would have the opportunity to engage with the Company during the go-shop period to pursue a competing transaction, the Transaction Committee unanimously recommended that our board of directors approve the merger agreement with Blackstone and encourage Party A to participate in the go-shop process. As a result of this discussion, the Transaction Committee determined that Mr. Murphy and representatives of the Company should not reach out to Party A until following the start of the go-shop period. On February 16, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S in attendance. Mr. Murphy and a representative of Goldman Sachs reviewed the non-binding proposal received from Party A and Mr. McLure noted that the Transaction Committee had met the night before and unanimously recommended that our board of directors approve the merger agreement with Blackstone and advise Party A to participate in the go-shop process. Our board of directors discussed with representatives of K&S and V&E the process for Party A to participate in the go-shop process and the considerations discussed by the Transaction Committee. Representatives of our management, Goldman Sachs and K&S then updated our board of directors on changes to the merger agreement since the last board of directors meeting and noted that the merger agreement and other transaction documentation were ready to be signed. A representative of V&E then reminded the members of our board of directors of their duties under Maryland law. A representative of V&E described a proposed amendment to our bylaws that would make specified state and federal courts in Maryland the sole and exclusive forum for litigation relating to our internal affairs, including stockholder derivative suits and alleged breaches of duties owed to stockholders, and the federal district courts in the United States the sole and exclusive forum for litigation arising under the Securities Act. Following this discussion, a representative of Goldman Sachs presented to our board of directors the Goldman Sachs’ financial analysis of the common stock consideration and rendered to our board of directors Goldman Sachs’ oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated February 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and 39 subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. A representative of V&E then reviewed the proposed resolutions prepared for the proposed transaction, including the engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. as an additional financial advisor to the Company. Following these presentations and discussions, and other discussions by our board of directors concerning, among other things, the matters described below under “-Reasons for the Mergers,” including our board of directors’ belief that the mergers are more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic transactions available to the Company, including remaining as an independent public company, our board of directors unanimously determined the mergers advisable, approved the mergers on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and resolved to recommend the approval of the mergers by our stockholders. Following the board of directors’ meeting, we contacted representatives of Blackstone to advise them that our board of directors had unanimously approved the proposed transaction. During the early morning on February 16, 2022, the Company, affiliates of Blackstone and the other parties thereto executed and delivered the merger agreement. The Company issued a press release publicly announcing the mergers and execution of the merger agreement before the opening of the market on February 16, 2022. The press release announcing the transaction also noted that the merger agreement included a 30-day “go- shop” period that would expire on March 18, 2022. Later in the day on February 16, 2022, at the direction of our board of directors, representatives of Goldman Sachs began contacting Party A, Party B, Party C and other potential counterparties that might consider entering into an alternative transaction with the Company. In addition, on February 17, 2022, Mr. Murphy sent an e-mail to Party A acknowledging its non-binding proposal from February 15, 2022, notifying it that the Company had begun its go-shop process pursuant to the merger agreement and welcoming Party A’s participation in the process. During the go- shop period, Goldman Sachs contacted 23 potential counterparties (including Party A, Party B and Party C), consisting of five strategic parties and 18 financial sponsor parties, and received inbound inquiries from two additional potential counterparties (one strategic and one financial). Of these 25 parties, nine, including Party A, Party B and Party C, entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company. Each of the parties that entered into a confidentiality agreement received access to the virtual data room containing non-public information about the Company. Other than the proposal submitted by Party A on February 15, 2022, none of these parties submitted a proposal to acquire the Company. Party A entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company on February 22, 2022 and received access to the virtual data room on such date. On March 4, 2022, representatives of Party A attended a due diligence call with Mr. Murphy, other members of our management and representatives of Goldman Sachs. Later that same day, members of our management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and K&S attended a legal due diligence call with representatives of Party A and its outside counsel. On March 15, 2022, a representative of Party A informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that Party A intended to submit a comprehensive bid package to the Company that would specify the economic terms of Party A’s offer and include definitive transaction documents, including debt commitment letters. On that same day, representatives of Party A’s outside counsel contacted K&S and conveyed the same message, and subsequently sent K&S a draft of Party A’s proposed merger agreement, equity commitment letter and limited guaranty. Party A’s proposed merger agreement did not specify the consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock and contemplated that the transaction would be financed through a combination of equity financing from an investment vehicle sponsored by Party A and debt financing from third party lenders in the form of senior secured bridge term loans and mortgage and mezzanine loans on terms that would be set forth in debt commitment letters. Party A did not provide debt commitment letters or otherwise describe the amount or terms of it proposed debt financing or identify the lenders who would provide the debt. Party A’s proposed equity commitment letter did not specify a commitment amount and funding of the equity was conditioned upon the receipt of debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letters. On March 16, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs had a call with representatives of Party A during which the Party A representatives indicated that they were aware of the upcoming expiration of the go-shop period on 40 March 18, 2022 and indicated that they expected to touch base with Goldman Sachs on March 17, 2022 to provide an update on Party A’s internal approval process, but that a formal offer would likely not be submitted until March 18, 2022. Representatives of Goldman Sachs notified the Company of these discussions, and the Company scheduled a board meeting for March 18, 2022 to discuss any offer that may be received from Party A and any other developments that may occur. Later on March 16, 2022, K&S, on behalf of the Company, sent comments on Party A’s proposed merger agreement, equity commitment letter and limited guaranty to Party A’s outside counsel. At 12:00 p.m. on March 17, 2022, Party A’s outside counsel met with members of our management and representatives of K&S to discuss outstanding due diligence matters. Later that day, representatives of Party A contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss Party A’s proposed sources of capital for the transaction. The representatives of Party A noted that the size and terms of Party A’s contemplated senior secured bridge term loans would result in unfavorable potential investment returns to Party A in a transaction. In order to mitigate this issue, the representatives of Party A noted that Party A would need to enter into an “equity bridge” instrument which would incrementally reduce the size of the bridge term loans if and to the extent that an investment vehicle affiliated with Party A’s sponsor received equity capital from third-party investors that was allocated to the transaction. In response to a question from representatives of Goldman Sachs on whether Party A could avoid this issue by instead using additional sources of available equity capital, the representatives of Party A explained that investment vehicles affiliated with Party A’s sponsor did not have sufficient committed capital at such time. A few hours later, representatives of Party A notified representatives of Goldman Sachs that Party A would not be submitting a proposal. The Party A representatives noted that, although Party A wished to submit a proposal, it was not able to obtain the necessary financing on terms that would permit it to pay more than the $25.00 per share of common stock under the Blackstone merger agreement. The representatives of Party A explained that given the recent deterioration in the debt and financial markets, and the fact that spreads on mortgage and mezzanine loans had widened significantly since it had submitted its non-binding proposal, Party A could not obtain sufficient financing on terms that would allow it to pay more than $25.00 per share. Representatives of Goldman Sachs promptly informed Mr. Murphy and the Company of this communication. The Company decided to hold the board meeting scheduled for March 18, 2022 to provide an opportunity for our board of directors to discuss any other developments that may occur prior to the expiry of the go-shop period. On March 18, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an overview of the go-shop process undertaken, including the broad solicitation of various strategic parties and financial sponsors, and the recent discussions with Party A. The Company issued a press release and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K prior to the market open on March 21, 2022, announcing that the go- shop period expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 18, 2022.

Reasons for the Mergers In reaching its unanimous decision to determine and declare the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, to be advisable and in our and our stockholders’ best interests and to approve the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend that the holders of common stock approve the merger proposal, the board of directors consulted with our senior management team, as well as our financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors which the board of directors viewed as supporting its decision: •the current and historical trading prices of shares of our common stock, and the fact that the merger consideration of $25.00 per share in cash represents a premium of approximately 39% to the unaffected closing price of $17.96 on February 9, 2022, the last trading day prior to the Bloomberg article reporting that the Company was exploring options including a full or partial sale after receiving inbound interest, and a premium of approximately 60% to the 90-day volume-weighted average price through that date; •the fact that the merger consideration was the result of arm’s-length negotiations and that the merger consideration of $25.00 per share exceeded Blackstone’s initial anticipated range as of December 7, 2021 of $4 to $5 per share above our common stock’s market price (implying an anticipated range of $17.56 to $18.56 per share based on the closing price of $13.56 per share on December 6, 2021); 41 •our board of directors’ belief that, in light of Blackstone’s low cost of capital, substantial available capital and interest in multifamily properties located in the Sunbelt region, Blackstone was the possible acquiror likely to offer the highest price for the Company; •our board of directors’ belief that there exists a limited universe of potential third parties with the financial ability to acquire the Company without obtaining financing from third parties in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of our common and preferred stock; and that the large amount of our preferred stock and debt could negatively impact the price for our common stock that bidders may be able to pay; •our board of directors’ belief that contacting other potential bidders before announcing a transaction with Blackstone given these circumstances would result in significant risks to the Company and its business, including concerns that market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt our business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price volatility; •our board of directors’ belief, in light of Blackstone’s stated unwillingness to participate in a pre-signing market check, that engaging with Party A would delay and jeopardize a transaction with Blackstone that was imminently ready to be entered into at the time of receipt of Party A’s proposal, taking into account the fact that Party A’s proposal was non-binding, that Party A had not yet conducted any non-public due diligence on the Company, that Party A indicated it would need five days to confirm its price after it received non-public property level and corporate information and then an unspecified period for confirmatory due diligence, that Party A’s offer was subject to and could be altered upon completion of due diligence, that it anticipated obtaining final approval from its investment committee upon completion of confirmatory diligence and agreement with the Company on the material transaction terms, and that at least a portion of the proceeds associated with Party A’s proposal may be sourced from an opportunity fund sponsored by Party A, indicating a higher cost of capital and a risk that Party A could reduce its price; •the Company’s right under the merger agreement, during the 30-day go-shop period, to actively solicit other proposals from, furnish information to and conduct negotiations with, third parties (including Party A) providing an opportunity to determine if a third party is willing to pay a higher value per share than Blackstone; •our right to terminate the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a superior proposal, upon payment of the company termination payment; •the fact that the lower company termination payment of $25 million during the go-shop period, which represented approximately $0.42 per share of common stock on a fully-diluted basis as of February 16, 2022 and approximately 0.5% of the Company’s enterprise value, and the company termination payment of $80 million following the go-shop period (representing approximately 1.4% of the Company’s enterprise value) were viewed by our board of directors, after consultation with our outside legal counsel and financial advisors, as reasonable under the circumstances, low compared to the size of the proposed transaction with Blackstone, the indication of interest from Party A, and similar transactions involving public companies, and not likely to preclude or discourage Party A or other interested parties from making a superior proposal; •our right after the go-shop period, in certain circumstances in response to unsolicited competing proposals, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties; •the right of our board of directors under the merger agreement to change, withhold, qualify or withdraw its recommendation that the holders of common stock approve the merger under certain circumstances, subject to payment of the company termination payment if Parent elects to terminate the merger agreement in such circumstances; •the fact that the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the closing of the merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent or greater value from our business plan for our properties or other possible strategic alternatives (including the sale of our grocery-anchored real estate assets); 42 •the knowledge of our board of directors of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of the Company, including its multifamily and grocery-anchored retail assets, as well as its knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which the Company and each of its businesses operate, including economic, market and capital raising conditions; •the accumulation of available equity capital for stabilized multifamily residential real estate assets resulting in low capitalization rates for those assets, with prices for multifamily residential real estate assets being at or near historical highs, strong revenue fundamentals in the multifamily residential real estate market in the Sunbelt region, increasing supply of multifamily residential real estate assets, as well as the possibility of interest rate increases in the future, which our board of directors and management believed made for opportune conditions for a sale transaction; •the risks and uncertainties of remaining a public company owner of our multifamily residential real estate portfolio and/or selling certain of our grocery-anchored retail assets, including the substantial amount of our preferred stock and debt, including significant property level debt, the need to frequently raise capital due to the capital-intensive nature of the Company’s business, the difficulty and cost of obtaining such capital, and the challenges of acquiring multifamily properties on an accretive basis in the current environment; •the belief that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic alternatives available to the Company, including after considering the feasibility of such alternatives and the significant risks and uncertainties associated with pursuing such alternatives, including remaining as an independent public company or selling certain or all of our grocery-anchored retail assets; •the expected probability that the mergers would be completed based on, among other things, Blackstone’s substantial available capital, proven ability to complete large acquisition transactions, extensive experience in the real estate industry, the absence of a financing condition and the $300 million parent termination payment payable to the Company if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances (representing approximately 5.4% of the Company’s enterprise value), which payment is guaranteed by BREIT Operating Partnership L.P.; •the financial analysis of Goldman Sachs reviewed and discussed with our board of directors, and the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion dated as of February 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully described below in the section “-Opinion of Our Financial Advisor”; •the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which were reviewed by the board of directors with our financial and legal advisors, and the fact that such terms were the product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties; and •the fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and our stockholders would be free to reject the merger by voting against the merger for any reason, including if a higher offer were to be made prior to the stockholders’ meeting (in certain cases subject to payment by the Company of an $80 million company termination payment if the Company subsequently were to enter into a definitive agreement relating to, or to consummate, a competing proposal). The board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the merger agreement and the merger: •our inability, after 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 18, 2022, to solicit competing proposals and the possibility that the company termination payment payable by us upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential bidders, including Party A, from making a competing bid to acquire us; 43 •the fact that, following the mergers, the Company will no longer exist as an independent public company and our existing stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth; •the risk that an alternative transaction or different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial to our stockholders than the proposed merger with Blackstone; •the fact that the mergers might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, due to a failure of certain conditions to the closing of the mergers, including the risk that our stockholders do not approve the merger proposal; •the fact that if either of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or Merger Sub III fails, or threatens to fail, to satisfy its obligations under the merger agreement, we are not entitled to specifically enforce the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter, and that our exclusive remedy, available if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, would be limited to the parent termination payment in the amount of $300 million (the payment of which is guaranteed by BREIT Operating Partnership L.P.); •the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the mergers, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the mergers; •the fact that, under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company is not permitted to make, declare or pay regular quarterly cash dividends on common stock for fiscal quarters after the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022; •the fact that the receipt of the cash consideration in the merger would be taxable to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; •the fact that, under Maryland law, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or similar rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger; •the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger agreement and completing the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the substantial time and effort of management required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and related disruptions to the operation of our business; •the fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the failure to complete the mergers, and/or actions that the Company may be required, or Parent may be permitted, to take under the merger agreement could have an adverse impact on our existing and prospective business relationships with tenants and other third parties and on our employees; and •the fact that some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, our stockholders generally (see “- Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”). The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material factors considered by the board of directors. In reaching its decision to determine and declare the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders and to approve the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend that the holders of common stock approve the merger proposal, the board of directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to, and did not make specific assessments of, the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered. The above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” 44 Recommendation of Our Board of Directors Our board of directors has unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement and determined the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. Unaudited Prospective Financial Information As a matter of general practice, due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections, we do not publicly disclose detailed projections as to our anticipated financial position or results of operations, other than providing, from time to time, estimated ranges for the then-current fiscal year of certain expected financial results and operational metrics in our regular earnings press releases and other investor materials. However, in connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction, our management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information for the Company on a consolidated basis for fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2026, which we refer to as the “financial projections”, which is summarized below. Such financial projections were provided to our board of directors, and to Goldman Sachs for use in connection with its financial analyses and fairness opinion. These financial projections were not intended for public disclosure, and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts or generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have audited, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the projections nor expressed an opinion or any form of assurance on the financial projections or their achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, such financial projections. A summary of the financial projections is included in this proxy statement only because the financial projections were made available to our board of directors and Goldman Sachs as described in this proxy statement. The inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by us that the information contained therein is material information. In the view of our management, the financial projections were prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting management’s best available estimates and judgments regarding our future financial performance at the time they were prepared. The financial projections have been included only to reflect information made available to our board of directors and Goldman Sachs at the time of certain events and decisions, are not facts and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and you are cautioned not to rely on the financial projections. Some or all of the assumptions that have been made in connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial projections were prepared. None of the Company or any of our affiliates, advisors or other representatives assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the financial projections. Neither the Company nor any of our affiliates have or intend to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to, update, revise or correct the financial projections if any or all of them have become or become inaccurate (even in the short term) since the time of their preparation. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the financial projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date. The financial projections do not reflect changes in general business or economic conditions since the time they were prepared, changes in our businesses or prospects since the time they were prepared, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated at the time the financial projections were prepared, and the financial projections are not necessarily indicative of current values or future performance, which may be significantly more favorable or less favorable than as set forth below and should not be regarded as a representation that the financial projections will be achieved. The projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. In addition, our future financial performance may be affected by our ability to successfully implement a number of initiatives to improve our operations and financial performance and our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. Because the financial projections reflect subjective judgment in many respects, they are susceptible to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The financial projections also cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The estimates and assumptions underlying the financial projections involve judgments with respect to, among other things, economic, competitive and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industries in which we operate. The financial projections constitute forward-looking information and 45",41,45

PREFERRED APARTMENT COMMUNITIES INC_20220414_DEFM14A_20015574_4442255.Pdf,Opinion of Our Financial Advisor,"Recommendation of Our Board of Directors Our board of directors has unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement and determined the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. Unaudited Prospective Financial Information As a matter of general practice, due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections, we do not publicly disclose detailed projections as to our anticipated financial position or results of operations, other than providing, from time to time, estimated ranges for the then-current fiscal year of certain expected financial results and operational metrics in our regular earnings press releases and other investor materials. However, in connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction, our management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information for the Company on a consolidated basis for fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2026, which we refer to as the “financial projections”, which is summarized below. Such financial projections were provided to our board of directors, and to Goldman Sachs for use in connection with its financial analyses and fairness opinion. These financial projections were not intended for public disclosure, and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts or generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

The financial projections constitute forward-looking information and 45 are subject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results. For additional information on factors that may cause our future financial results to materially vary from the projected results summarized below, see “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” beginning on page 21 of this proxy statement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized or that actual results will not differ materially from the projected results summarized below, and the financial projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon as such. Neither we nor our affiliates nor advisors nor any other person has made any representation to any of our stockholders or any other person regarding our actual performance compared to the results included in the financial projections. We have not made any representation to Blackstone or its affiliates, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the financial projections. The financial projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in our public filings with the SEC. The financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared, including the mergers. Further, the financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the mergers to be consummated and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Financial Projections The following table summarizes the financial projections of the Company that were provided to our board of directors in connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction. The following financial projections were also provided to Goldman Sachs by us for use in connection with its financial analyses and the fairness opinion rendered to our board of directors (summarized under “- Opinion of Our Financial Advisor - Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” beginning on page 47 of this proxy statement). Our management made various assumptions when preparing the financial projections. These assumptions include annualized revenue growth of approximately 7% on average from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2026, annualized adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 9% on average from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2026, annualized Core FFO/Share growth of approximately 11% on average from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2026 and annualized AFFO/Share growth of approximately 11% on average from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2026.

Total Cash NOI was calculated as Total GAAP Net Operating Income less Total GAAP Revenues which includes straight-line rent and amortization of above / below market lease intangibles. (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA was calculated as net income adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) from sales of depreciated property, income tax expense (or benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of depreciated property, similar adjustments for unconsolidated entities, certain nonroutine charges, write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, restructuring costs, and transaction and integration costs, as well as our pro-rata share of each of those respective expenses associated with unconsolidated entities, and certain non-cash recurring costs such as equity-based compensation. (3) Core FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Core FFO was calculated by: (i) adding to net income depreciation and amortization related to real estate, losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, losses from change in control, impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of 46 depreciable real estate held by the entity, acquisition and pursuit (dead deal) costs, loan cost amortization on acquisition line of credit and loan coordination fees, losses on debt extinguishments or refinancing costs, internalization costs, expenses incurred on calls of preferred stock, deemed dividends for redemptions of and non-cash dividends on preferred stock and expenses related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and (ii) subtracting from net income gains from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains from change in control and earnest money forfeitures by prospective asset purchasers. Core FFO per share was calculated by dividing Core FFO by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. Our calculation of Core FFO may differ from methodologies utilized by other REITs for similar performance measurements and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other REITs. (4) AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. AFFO was calculated by: (i) adding to Core FFO non-cash equity compensation to directors and executives, non-cash expense for current expected credit losses, amortization of loan closing costs, depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets, net loan origination fees received, deferred interest income received, amortization of lease inducements, cash received in excess of amortization of purchase option termination revenues and earnest money forfeiture from prospective asset purchaser and (ii) subtracting from Core FFO non-cash income for current expected credit losses, non-cash loan interest income, cash paid for loan closing costs, amortization of straight-line rent adjustments and acquired real estate intangible assets and/or liabilities, amortization of deferred revenues, cash received exceeded by amortization of purchase option termination revenues, normally-recurring capital expenditures and capitalized second generation leasing costs. AFFO per share was calculated by dividing AFFO by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. Our calculation of AFFO may differ from methodologies utilized by other REITs for similar performance measurements and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other REITs.

LLC At the February 16, 2022 meeting of the board of directors, Goldman Sachs rendered to the board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated February 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Opinion of Our Financial Advisor Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC At the February 16, 2022 meeting of the board of directors, Goldman Sachs rendered to the board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated February 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 16, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with Goldman Sachs’ opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference in its entirety. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the board of directors in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of common stock should vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter. In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things: •the merger agreement; •annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five years ended December 31, 2020; •certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; •certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; •certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and •certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the Company (referred to in this section as the “financial projections” and which are summarized in the section entitled “-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”). 47 Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the real estate industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate. For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of our board of directors, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of our board of directors that the financial projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs’ analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs’ analysis. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company, including a certain non-binding proposal provided by a third party (referred to as Party A in the section entitled “-Background of the Mergers”) for a transaction at a price per share of common stock in cash greater than that in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (as described in the section entitled “-Background of the Mergers”), which non-binding proposal our board of directors advised Goldman Sachs it determined not to pursue until after the execution of the merger agreement in accordance with the relevant terms of the merger agreement; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company or any other alternative transaction prior to the execution of the merger agreement, but did solicit interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company during the go-shop period. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock, as of the date of its opinion, of the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to such holders. Goldman Sachs did not express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the partnership merger and the operations merger, or the fairness of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, whether relative to the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs did not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of common stock would trade at any time, or as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or as to the impact of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on the solvency or viability of the Company, the Partnership, Operations or Parent or the ability of the Company, the Partnership, Operations or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion, and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of the opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services 48 and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the board of directors in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of the shares of common stock should vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs. Summary of Financial Analyses The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to our board of directors in connection with Goldman Sachs’ rendering to our board of directors of the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 15, 2022, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the mergers, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. Implied Premia and Multiples Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied premia and implied multiples described below based on the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock relative to: •$17.96, the closing price of the shares of common stock on February 9, 2022, the last full trading day before Bloomberg News published an article reporting that the Company was exploring options including a full or partial sale after receiving inbound interest (which we refer to as the “Pre- Bloomberg Article Share Price”); •$17.72, the volume weighted average price (which we refer to as the “VWAP”) of the shares of common stock over the 30-trading-day period ended February 9, 2022 (which we refer to as the “30-Day VWAP”); •$15.60, the VWAP of the shares of common stock over the 90-trading-day period ended February 9, 2022 (which we refer to as the “90-Day VWAP”); •$13.59, the VWAP of the shares of common stock over the 180-trading-day period ended February 9, 2022 (which we refer to as the “180-Day VWAP”); •$14.39, the closing price of the shares of common stock on December 17, 2021, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the acquisition of Bluerock by affiliates of Blackstone (which we refer to as the “Pre-Bluerock Share Price”); •$15.23, the VWAP of the shares of common stock over the 30-trading-day period ended December 31, 2021, the last full trading day before Reuters published an article reporting that Arkhouse Partners intended to nominate five directors to the board of directors (which we refer to as the “30-Day VWAP Pre-Reuters Article”); •$19.27, the highest closing trading price of the shares of common stock over the 52-week period ended February 9, 2022 (which we refer to as the “52-Week High”); •$7.36, the lowest closing trading price of the shares of common stock over the 52-week period ended February 9, 2022 (which we refer to as the “52- Week Low”); and 49 •$17.00, the median Wall Street research analyst price target (which we refer to as the “Median Research Price Target”). The results of these calculations and comparisons are as follows: Reference Price per share of common stock Implied Premium Represented by $25.00 in cash per share of common stock Pre-Bloomberg Article Share Price of $17.96 39.2% 30-Day VWAP of $17.72 41.1% 90-Day VWAP of $15.60 60.3% 180-Day VWAP of $13.59 84.0% Pre-Bluerock Share Price of $14.39 73.7% 30-Day VWAP Pre-Reuters Article of $15.23 64.2% 52-Week High of $19.27 29.7% 52-Week Low of $7.36 239.7% Median Research Price Target of $17.00 47.1% Goldman Sachs also calculated the following multiples: •The $25.00 in cash per share of common stock as a multiple of the median consensus estimated funds from operations (which we refer to as “FFO”) per share of common stock for calendar year 2022, as published by The Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (which is referred to in this section as “I/B/E/S”); and •The $25.00 in cash per share of common stock as a multiple of the median consensus estimated adjusted funds from operations (which we refer to as “AFFO”) per share of common stock for calendar year 2022, as published by SNL Financial (which is referred to in this section as “SNL”). The results of these calculations and comparisons are as follows: Reference FFO/AFFO per share of common stock Implied Multiple Represented by $25.00 in cash per share of common stock 2022 FFO of $0.97 (I/B/E/S) 25.8x 2022 AFFO of $0.78 (SNL) 32.1x Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared, using publicly available data obtained from SNL, certain financial information for the Company to corresponding financial information and public market multiples for Bluerock and the selected publicly traded real estate investment trusts listed below in the multifamily segment (which are referred to in this section as the “multifamily selected companies”) and the grocery-anchored retail segment (which are referred to in this section as the “grocery-anchored selected companies” and together with the multifamily selected companies, the “selected companies”). Although none of the selected companies or Bluerock is directly comparable to the Company, the selected companies and Bluerock were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of the Company. For each of the Company, Bluerock and the selected companies, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared: •the closing price per share, as of February 11, 2022 (with respect to the Company, as of February 9, 2022, and with respect to Bluerock, the price per share implied by the announced acquisition of Bluerock by affiliates of Blackstone), as a multiple of the next twelve months’ (which we refer to as “NTM”) FFO for such company (which is referred to in the table below as “Current P/NTM FFO”); 50 •the average of each company’s historical price to NTM FFO multiples for the 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ended February 11, 2022 (which is referred to in the table below as “Last 1 Year Average P/NTM FFO,” “Last 3 Year Average P/NTM FFO,” and “Last 5 Year Average P/NTM FFO,” respectively); and •the weighted average price to NTM FFO multiple for the selected companies as of February 11, 2022 and for the 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ended February 11, 2022, calculated based on the median of each of the multifamily selected companies’ and the grocery-anchored selected companies’ average price to NTM FFO multiples for such periods (applying 70% and 30% weightings for the multifamily selected companies and the grocery anchored selected companies, respectively). The multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs for the Company, Bluerock and the selected companies are as follows: Company / Selected Company / Segment Current P/NTM FFO Last 1 Year Average P/NTM FFO Last 3 Years Average P/NTM FFO Last 5 Years Average P/NTM FFO Company 20.8x 14.7x 10.9x 10.8x Bluerock 37.4x 18.6x 15.0x 15.0x Multifamily Selected Companies Camden Property Trust 26.5x 25.8x 21.6x 20.4x NexPoint Residential Trust Inc. 30.8x 25.3x 21.7x 19.6x Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. 26.4x 25.9x 21.4x 19.4x Centerspace 21.8x 22.7x 20.1x 18.1x Independence Realty Trust Inc. 26.1x 23.7x 18.5x 16.2x Multifamily Selected Companies Median 26.4x 25.3x 21.4x 19.4x Grocery-Anchored Selected Companies Regency Centers Corporation 16.8x 18.7x 16.1x 16.4x Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. 17.5x 17.3x 14.8x 15.3x Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. 12.3x 13.0x 12.8x 13.9x Kimco Realty Corp. 15.9x 16.3x 13.1x 12.6x Brixmor Property Group Inc. 13.1x 13.1x 10.4x 9.7x Grocery-Anchored Selected Companies Median 15.9x 16.3x 13.1x 13.9x Selected Companies Weighted Average 23.3x 22.6x 18.9x 17.8x Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of common stock, based on theoretical future prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for the shares of common stock. Goldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of common stock as of December 31 of each of 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 by applying the illustrative price to next twelve months’ Core FFO multiples ranging from 13.5x to 23.5x to estimates of the Core FFO of the Company for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively, as reflected in the financial projections. By applying a discount rate of 9.9%, reflecting an estimate of the Company’s cost of equity, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value, as of December 31, 2021, and summed, both the theoretical future values per share of common stock it derived for each applicable year and the estimated dividends to be paid per share of common stock on a stand-alone basis through the end of the applicable year as reflected in the financial projections, to yield illustrative present values per share of common stock ranging from $12.76 to $24.00. The illustrative price to next twelve months’ Core FFO multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by Goldman Sachs using its professional judgement and experience, taking into account the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under “-Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.” Goldman Sachs derived the discount rate used in the foregoing analysis by application of the capital asset pricing model (which we 51 refer to as “CAPM”), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. Illustrative Levered Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Using the financial projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative levered discounted cash flow analysis on the Company to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of common stock. Using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 11.5%, reflecting estimates of the cost of equity of the Company, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative present values per share of common stock, by discounting to present value as of December 31, 2021, (a) the estimates of the levered free cash flow to be generated by the Company for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026, as reflected in the financial projections, and (b) a range of illustrative terminal values for the Company as of December 31, 2026, calculated by applying a range of terminal year multiples of 13.5x to 23.5x to the Company’s estimated terminal year Core FFO as reflected in the financial projections (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 6.9%). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of terminal year multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under “-Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.” Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative present values per share of common stock by adding the ranges of present values it calculated for the levered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described above, and then dividing the result by the implied total number of fully diluted shares of common stock estimated to be outstanding as of February 9, 2022, as provided by management of the Company. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative present values per share of common stock of $13.04 to $23.56. Premia Paid Analysis Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the premia paid in all-cash acquisition transactions of publicly traded REITs in the United States and Canada announced since 2015 through February 15, 2022 (excluding transactions announced but terminated prior to closing) in which the target company had an implied enterprise value of greater than $500 million. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the 25  percentile, median, mean and 75  percentile premia of the price paid in the identified transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to the announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a 25  percentile premium of 13.3%, a median premium of 19.4%, a mean premium of 26.0% and a 75  percentile premium of 25.6%. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs then applied an illustrative premia range of 13.3% to 25.6%, corresponding to the 25  and 75 percentiles premia described above, to the undisturbed closing price per share of common stock of $17.96, the Pre-Bloomberg Article Share Price, and calculated a range of implied values per share of common stock of $20.36 to $22.56. General The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company, Parent or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the th th th th th th 52 prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon projections of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast. The consideration of $25.00 in cash per share of common stock was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was approved by the board of directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the board of directors during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the mergers. As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion to the board of directors and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Blackstone, an affiliate of Parent, and its affiliates and portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs expects to receive fees for its services in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of its expenses arising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities that may arise, out of its engagement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to its sale of a portfolio of office assets in July 2021. During the two-year period ended February 16, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to the Company and/or its affiliates of approximately $2.5 million as determined by Goldman Sachs based on its books and records. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Blackstone and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as left lead bookrunner with respect to a public offering of 4.25% Notes due 2026 (aggregate principal amount $750,000,000) by Blue Yonder Group, Inc., a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, in July 2020; as lead arranger with respect to the floating rate securitization (aggregate principal amount $630,000,000) entered into by Blackstone Real Estate Advisors, an affiliate of Blackstone, in August 2020; as a bookrunner with respect to the term loan B facility (aggregate principal amount $1,670,000,000) and the 4.75% secured notes due 2027 (aggregate principal amount $375,000,000) issued by the Michaels Companies, Inc., a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, in September 2020; as financial advisor to Rothesay Life plc, a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, with respect to the sale of Blackstone’s equity interest in December 2020; as financial advisor to BioMed Realty Trust Inc., a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its recapitalization into a new fund affiliated with Blackstone in November 2020; as financial advisor to Change Healthcare Inc., a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its pending sale to UnitedHealth Group announced in January 2021; as left lead bookrunner with respect to a term loan repricing and add on (aggregate principal amount $1,460,000,000) by BME Group Holding BV, a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, in March 2021; as financial advisor to a consortium of Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, an affiliate of Blackstone, and B&J Holdings Limited with respect to the consortium’s recommended offer to acquire Applegreen plc in March 2021; as left lead bookrunner with respect to a follow-on public offering of the equity of TaskUS LLC, a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, in October 2021; as a bookrunner for Medline Industries Inc., a portfolio company of 53 funds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its bridge financing completed in October 2021; and as financial advisor to Aqua Finance Inc., a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its pending sale to Apollo, announced in November 2021. During the two- year period ended February 16, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Blackstone and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies of approximately $359 million as determined by Goldman Sachs based on its books and records. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Parent, Blackstone and their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-invested with Blackstone and its affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Blackstone from time to time and may do so in the future. The Company selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the mergers. Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, dated February 15, 2022, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the mergers. The engagement letter provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the announcement of the merger agreement, at approximately $36 million, $1 million of which was payable upon announcement of the merger agreement and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its actual, out-of-pocket, documented and reasonable expenses, including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws. Financing In connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $3.5 billion to be paid to the holders of common stock (assuming the cash exercise of all outstanding company warrants), preferred stock, time-vested restricted stock, earned PSUs, earned RSUs, time-vested RSUs, Class A partnership units and operations preferred shares (in each case other than excluded securities). Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent expects to cause the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, if any, to be repaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans to be repaid or remain outstanding. As of April 11, 2022 we had no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and as of March 31, 2022 we had approximately $2.4 billion in mortgage loans outstanding. Parent has informed us that it currently intends to pursue obtaining debt financing to be provided in connection with the mergers. In addition, it is expected that the Sponsor and its affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt financing. Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and expenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the potential debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned by us, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings. The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the mergers. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide, all customary cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in connection with the arrangement of debt financing with respect to us or our subsidiaries, or our or our subsidiaries’ real property. For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement-Financing Cooperation” and “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Mergers.” Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to approve the merger, the merger agreement and the other proposals described above, our stockholders should be aware that our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and 54",47,54

These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and 54 considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to determine and declare the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, to be advisable and in our and our stockholders’ best interests to approve the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend that the common stockholders approve the merger. These interests are discussed below. Section 16(b) Exemption Resolution Our board of directors believes that it is desirable that the Company’s directors and executive officers be relieved of the risk of liability under Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the exchange of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger. Accordingly, our board of directors (or a committee thereof) intends to adopt a resolution providing that the disposition by the Company’s executive officers and directors of our common stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the merger, are intended to be exempt from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated thereunder. Treatment of Compensatory Awards Our executive officers hold time-vested restricted stock, performance stock units and restricted stock units, as applicable, as further set forth in the section entitled “-Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers.” We are not including information with respect to any former executive officers of the Company who are not current executive officers and who have no interest in the merger. Time-Vested Restricted Stock. The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding time-vested restricted stock granted pursuant to the long-term incentive plans will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive the common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Performance Stock Units. The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding performance stock unit granted pursuant to the long-term incentive plans, which remains subject to vesting based all or in part on future achievement of performance goals, will become earned and vested with respect to that number of shares of common stock subject to such performance stock unit in accordance with the terms of such performance stock unit (but without applying any pro-ration for the number of days of employment during the shortened performance period ending on the closing date) based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals set forth in the award agreement governing such performance stock unit (as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors) as measured from the beginning of the applicable performance period through the closing date (or the latest practicable date prior thereto that performance can be assessed). At the merger effective time, each earned PSU will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment withholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned PSU. Additionally, in no event later than five business days after the merger effective time or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code, we will pay to each holder of earned PSUs an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes. Each performance stock unit that does not become an earned PSU will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time. Restricted Stock Units. The merger agreement provides that, (1) each market cap restricted stock unit issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time that is an earned RSU, and (2) each time-vested RSU (whether vested or unvested) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time, will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment withholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned RSU or time-vested RSU (as applicable). Any issued and outstanding market cap restricted stock unit that is not an earned RSU as of immediately prior to the merger effective time will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time. Value of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would become payable to each of our named executive officers, see “- Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” below. The estimated value of the payments that will be made to our other executive officers, Mr. Aide and Mr. Sprain, at the merger effective time in respect of their outstanding Company restricted stock awards, PSUs, and dividend equivalent rights is $2,953,435, which is based on the number of outstanding awards held by these current executive officers as of April 11, 2022. The estimated value of the payments that will be made to our non-employee directors at the merger effective time in respect of their outstanding Company restricted share awards is $1,238,800, which is based on the number of outstanding awards held by the non-employee directors as of April 11, 2022. These estimated values assume (a) that PSUs that vest based on 55 relative total stockholder return will be earned based on maximum performance levels, and (b) that all time-based restricted stock and PSU awards (and any accrued but unpaid dividends or dividend equivalents relating thereto) held by each of our current executive officers and our non- employee directors, as applicable, as of April 11, 2022, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this filing, remain outstanding as of the merger effective time and each of them does not receive any additional compensatory awards between such date and the merger effective time. Treatment of Interests in the Partnership Our executive officers hold Class A partnership units, as further set forth in the section entitled “-Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers”. Class A Partnership Units. The merger agreement provides that, at the partnership merger effective time, each Class A partnership unit, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than excluded Class A partnership units) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the partnership unit consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. As discussed above, if we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, or to avoid or reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the partnership unit consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock. Class B Partnership Units. The merger agreement provides that each vested Class B partnership unit, or fraction thereof, that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time that becomes an “Earned Class B Unit” (pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement) and which has a “Capital Account” (as defined in the partnership agreement) equal to the “Average Capital Account Balance” (as defined in the partnership agreement) (taking into account any allocations that would be deemed to occur pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement) will automatically be converted into a Class A partnership unit. Thereafter, the Class A partnership units issued in respect of the converted Earned Class B Units will be treated as Class A partnership units for purposes of the merger agreement (as set forth above). Pursuant to the award agreements, all of the Class B partnership units became Earned Class B Units and converted into Class A partnership units on March 31, 2022, and as such, the provisions in the merger agreement applicable to the conversion of unvested Class B partnership units no longer apply. The Class B partnership unit award agreements provide that to the extent the payments payable under the Class B Unit award agreement are in the nature of compensation and are contingent on a change in the ownership of the Company and would be subject (in whole or in part) to an excise tax imposed by reason of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax, the “excise tax”), the executive will receive an additional payment (the “excise tax gross-up payment”) in an amount such that, after payment by the executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes and excise tax imposed upon the excise tax gross-up payment, the executive will retain an amount equal to the excise tax imposed on the payments provided under the Class B Unit award agreement. Value of Payments. For purposes of this disclosure, we have assumed that all Class B partnership units that converted to Class A partnership units on March 31, 2022 will be valued based on the $25.00 per share common stock consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement, but that no excise tax gross-up payment will apply under these Class B partnership units due to the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. For an estimate of the value of the Class A partnership units that were issued upon the conversion of the Class B partnership units on March 31, 2022 to each of our named executive officers, see “- Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” below. The estimated value of Class A partnership units that were issued on March 31, 2022 to Messrs. Cronin, Sherman and Aide who held outstanding Class B partnership units as of March 15, 2022, is $244,300, $152,700 and $91,625, which is based on the number of outstanding Class B partnership units held as of March 15, 2022. As of April 11, 2022, Messrs. Isakson, Cronin, Sherman, and Aide beneficially owned 20,551, 9,772, 9,513, and 7,071 Class A partnership units, respectively, and owned no Class B partnership units. Messrs. Isakson, Cronin, Sherman, and Aide will receive aggregate consideration of approximately $513,775, $244,300, $237,825 and $176,775, respectively, with respect to such Class A partnership units in the merger. For a more complete discussion of the treatment of the Class A partnership units, see “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Interests in the Partnership.” Executive Severance Benefits Arrangements. None of our executive officers are party to an individual employment agreement providing for severance upon a termination of employment. However, the Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. Executive 56 Severance and Change in Control Plan (the “Severance Plan”) provides certain severance benefits in the case of a qualifying termination of employment, which is defined as a termination by the Company without cause or a resignation by the executive for good reason, as those terms are defined in the Severance Plan or in the participating executive’s participation agreement thereunder, including a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control. Consistent with our 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the Severance Plan also provides for a payout of performance- based equity awards upon a change in control, based on actual performance through the date of the change in control. All of our named executive officers and other current executive officers are participants in the Severance Plan. Under the Severance Plan, if a plan participant’s employment with us is terminated by the participant for good reason or by us other than for cause, in each case within 24 months following a change in control (as defined in the Severance Plan) and other than as a result of the participant’s death or disability, the participant is entitled to receive (1) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to 1.50 (3.0 for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer), multiplied by the sum of (a) an amount equivalent to twelve (12) months of the participant’s base salary, and (b) the participant’s target annual performance bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control; plus (2) continued group health care continuation at the active employee rate for up to 18 months (36 months for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) following termination of employment, but subject to cessation once the participant becomes eligible for coverage from a new employer; (3) a pro- rated annual bonus (based on the target amount) for the calendar year in which the participant’s employment termination date occurs; and (4) accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards, as determined by the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and the award agreements. Payments are generally made sixty (60) days following termination. Any payments payable under the Severance Plan are conditioned on the execution and non-revocation of a release for the benefit of the Company and its related entities and agents. Restrictive Covenants. Any payments payable under the Severance Plan are also subject to the executive’s compliance with certain confidentiality, non-disparagement, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants that apply during the executive’s employment and for a specified period thereafter. The non-competition period applies during employment and ranges from 6 to 12 months following termination of employment. The non- solicitation period is during employment and the 24 months following termination of employment. The non-disparagement period is during employment and 36 months following termination of employment. The confidentiality period is during employment and perpetual following termination of employment. Golden Parachute Excise Tax. The Severance Plan does not provide a tax gross-up provision for federal excise taxes that may be imposed under sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Instead, the Severance Plan provides that if amounts payable to a participant under the Severance Plan, together with any other amounts that are payable by the Company as a result of a change in control, exceed the amount allowed under section 280G of the Code for such individual, thereby subjecting the individual to an excise tax under section 4999 of Code, then, depending on which method produces the better net after-tax benefit for the recipient, such payments shall either be: (1) reduced to the level at which no excise tax applies or (2) paid in full, with the participant being responsible for his or her excise and other taxes. Value of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would become payable to each of our named executive officers upon a severance-qualifying termination, see “- Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” below. The estimated value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable upon a severance-qualifying termination of employment for our other executive officers, Messrs. Aide and Sprain, is $952,773 and $834,127, respectively. Indemnification of Our Directors and Officers The merger agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and after the merger effective time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the merger effective time, the Surviving Company will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to: (1) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of our and our subsidiaries’ current or former managers, directors, officers and trustees (which persons we refer to as the “indemnified parties”), against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, cause of action, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, mediation, interference, audit, assessment, hearing or other legal proceeding (we refer to the foregoing as an “action”), arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such indemnified party’s capacity as a manager, director, officer or trustee of the Company or any of our subsidiaries arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the merger effective time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the merger effective time), including such alleged acts or omissions with respect to the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers; and (2) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such action the expenses (including 57 reasonable attorneys’ fees and any expenses incurred by any indemnified party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to indemnification) of any indemnified party without the requirement of any bond or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by law, but subject to Parent’s or the Surviving Company’s receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified. The parties have agreed not to terminate or modify the obligations described above regarding indemnification of the indemnified parties in such a manner as to adversely affect such indemnified parties, and such obligations must be assumed by any successor entity to the Surviving Company as a result of any consolidation, merger, dissolution or transfer of all or substantially all of its properties and assets. The merger agreement also requires that, prior to the merger effective time, we will bind, effective at the merger effective time, extended coverage under our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy by obtaining a prepaid six-year “tail” extended period on our existing officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policies (or with insurers on terms and conditions no less favorable than such policies), which prepaid policies provide such persons currently covered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the merger effective time, for an overall additional premium not to exceed 300% of the total annual premiums at the last renewal; provided, that we will reasonably cooperate and consult with Parent prior to the purchase of any such tail policy; provided, further, that if Parent can procure a “tail” policy on superior terms or on equivalent terms, but at a lower price, as compared to any such policy that may be procured by us, then, subject to certain terms and conditions, Parent may obtain such policy effective as of the merger effective time, in which case we shall not obtain such policy. Additionally, Parent and the Surviving Company are required to maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. Director Transaction Fees Our board of directors approved a fee of $20,000 to each member of the Transaction Committee, a fee of $15,000 to members of our board of directors that were not on the Transaction Committee, and a fee of $30,000 to Mr. McLure (chairman of the Transaction Committee) in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. We have omitted any named executive officer who is no longer an executive officer and who is not entitled to any payments or benefits in connection with the mergers. Solely for purposes of the table below, it is assumed that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination immediately following the merger effective time. Such amounts have been calculated assuming the merger effective time occurs on April 11, 2022. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments described below, see the discussion under “- Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” above. The following table sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that may be paid or become payable to each of the named executive officers in connection with the mergers pursuant to all applicable compensation plans or agreements, assuming that the merger effective time occurred on April 11, 2022, which is the latest practicable date prior to the date of this filing and the assumed date of the merger effective time solely for purposes of this merger-related compensation disclosure and that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination immediately following the merger effective time. 58 Golden Parachute Compensation Name Cash ($)(1) Equity ($)(2) Perquisites/ Benefits ($)(3) Total ($) Joel T.

Murphy and Isakson, a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i) a severance payment in an amount equal to 3.0 multiplied by the sum of the executive’s annual base salary plus the executive’s target annual performance bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control; and (ii) a pro-rated annual bonus (based on the target amount) for the calendar year in which the participant’s employment termination date occurs; and (b) For Messrs. Cronin and Sherman, a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i) a severance payment in an amount equal to 1.5 multiplied by the sum of the executive’s annual base salary plus the executive’s target annual performance bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control; and (ii) a pro-rated annual bonus (based on the target amount) for the calendar year in which the participant’s employment termination date occurs. The amounts set forth in the table above are based on compensation levels as of April 11, 2022 and assume that there are no bonus amounts which have been earned but not yet paid to the named executive officer prior to the date of the named executive officer’s termination. For further details regarding the cash severance, see “- Executive Severance Benefits” above. (2) For all named executive officers, the treatment of compensatory awards at the merger effective time is a “single-trigger” benefit contingent upon the occurrence of the merger. The amounts set forth in the table above and the table below are estimates of the value each named executive officer will receive in respect of his outstanding equity awards. These amounts include the value of PSUs that would accelerate in full at the merger effective time, based on actual performance through the date of the change in control. These amounts assume the performance metrics were achieved at maximum performance as of April 11, 2022. The value of the accelerated PSUs was calculated by multiplying the number of accelerated shares by $25.00 based on the common stock consideration pursuant to the merger agreement. These amounts also include (a) the value of time-based restricted stock awards, which accelerate in full in connection with the change in control, (b) cash dividends on PSUs, which are scheduled to be paid following the merger effective time, and (c) value of the Class B partnership units that were converted into Class A partnership units on March 31, 2022.

Messrs. Murphy and Isakson are each entitled to continued health coverage at the active employee rate for up to 36 months (18 months for Messrs. Cronin and Sherman) following termination of employment, but subject to cessation once the participant becomes eligible for coverage from a new employer. The value of the perquisites/benefits reported in this column assume that such coverage continues for the full 36-month or 18-month period, as applicable. These benefits are “double-trigger” benefits contingent upon the occurrence of a termination of the named executive officer’s employment without cause or the named executive officer’s resignation for good reason during the twenty-four (24) months following the merger effective time. For further details regarding the perquisites and benefits, see “- Executive Severance Benefits” above. 59 Regulatory Matters We are unaware of any material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required for the execution of the merger agreement or the completion of the merger, the partnership merger or the operations merger, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger with respect to the merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, and the filing of the certificates of merger with respect to each of the merger, partnership merger and operations merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

The fifth suit, styled as Ferguson v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-03033, which we refer to as the “Ferguson Lawsuit,” was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Stein Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and the Company’s directors. The Stein Lawsuit asserts, on behalf of an individual plaintiff, (1) a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and its implementing regulations, alleging that purported omissions render the proxy statement false and misleading; and (2) a “control person” claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violation. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including line items used to calculate non- GAAP financial metrics, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, levered free cash flow information, and input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs’ analysis. Relying on those allegations, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff’s costs and attorney’s fees. The Wang Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company’s directors. Like the Stein Lawsuit, the Wang Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Wang Lawsuit contains substantially the same allegations as the Stein Lawsuit and seeks substantially the same relief as the Stein Lawsuit. The Anderson Lawsuit, like the Stein Lawsuit and Wang Lawsuit, names as defendants the Company and the Company’s directors. The Anderson Lawsuit also asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Anderson Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs’ analysis, the Company’s nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties, and details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company’s officers and directors. The Anderson Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, a declaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff’s costs and attorney’s fees. The Hopkins Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and its directors. The Hopkins Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs’ analysis, the Company’s nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties, information relating to the Company’s engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., and details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company’s officers and directors. The Hopkins Lawsuit also alleges that the Company’s officers stand to benefit from the merger and that the price of the merger is unfair. Relying on those allegations, the Hopkins Lawsuit asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duties against the directors and a claim for declaratory and equitable relief against all defendants. The Ferguson Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and its directors. The Ferguson Lawsuit, like the Stein, Wang, and Anderson Lawsuits, asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants 60",54,60

The Hopkins Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs’ analysis, the Company’s nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties, information relating to the Company’s engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., and details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company’s officers and directors. The Hopkins Lawsuit also alleges that the Company’s officers stand to benefit from the merger and that the price of the merger is unfair. Relying on those allegations, the Hopkins Lawsuit asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duties against the directors and a claim for declaratory and equitable relief against all defendants. The Ferguson Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and its directors. The Ferguson Lawsuit, like the Stein, Wang, and Anderson Lawsuits, asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants 60 and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Ferguson Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including the powers and composition of the Transaction Committee, certain financial projections and metrics, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs’ analysis, information relating to the Company’s engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., the Company’s nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties, and details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company’s officers and directors. The Ferguson Lawsuit also alleges that the proxy statement fails to disclose the value of company options, restricted stock units, and other equity awards that Company directors, officers, and employees will receive in the proposed merger. The Ferguson Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff’s costs and attorney’s fees. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and could delay or prevent the mergers from becoming effective in a timely manner. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend against these actions vigorously. Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each, as defined below) of shares of common stock and preferred stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), each, as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. We have not sought and will not seek an advance ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this section. This summary assumes that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the merger agreement and as described in this proxy statement. This discussion is not a complete description of all tax consequences of the merger and, in particular, does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, any withholding considerations pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance thereunder and the intergovernmental agreements entered into, and laws and regulations promulgated, pursuant thereto or in connection therewith) nor does it address any tax considerations under state, local or non-U.S. laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax. For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: •an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; •a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; •a trust (1) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more “United States persons” (as defined under the Code) who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or •an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source. For purposes of this discussion, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion applies only to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders of shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock who hold such shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, and it does not apply to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example: •insurance companies; •dealers, brokers or traders in securities or currencies; 61",60,61

Further, this discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, and it does not apply to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example: •insurance companies; •dealers, brokers or traders in securities or currencies; 61 •traders in securities who elect to apply the mark-to-market method of accounting; •broker-dealers; •persons acting as nominees or otherwise not as beneficial owners; •holders subject to the alternative minimum tax; •persons who are required to recognize income or gain no later than such income or gain is required to be reported on an applicable financial statement; •U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; •tax-exempt entities and organizations; •retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred or advantaged accounts (or persons holding shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock through such plans or accounts); •banks and other financial institutions; •certain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States; •controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies; •partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other flow-through entities (and investors therein); •S corporations; •REITs; •regulated investment companies; •holders who own or have owned at any time, or are deemed to own or to have owned at any time, directly, indirectly or constructively, at least 5% or more, by voting power or value, of our stock; •“qualified foreign pension funds” (within the meaning of Section 897(1)(2) of the Code) or entities all of the interests in which are held by a qualified pension fund; •“qualified shareholders” (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or investors therein; •non-U.S. holders who hold, or have held at any time, directly, indirectly, or constructively, more than 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock or more than 10% of our outstanding shares of preferred stock; •holders who hold shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated or risk reduction transaction; or •holders who acquired shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards, through a tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation. If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, the tax treatment of a partner in that partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of the merger to it in light of its particular circumstances. DETERMINING THE ACTUAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO A HOLDER MAY BE COMPLEX AND WILL DEPEND ON A HOLDER’S SPECIFIC SITUATION. ALL HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX LAWS AND ANY POTENTIAL CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS. Tax Classification of the Merger in General It is expected the merger will be treated as (1) the adoption by the Company of a plan of liquidation, and (2) a sale by the Company of all of its assets to Merger Sub I (or, if applicable, its regarded owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in exchange for the common stock consideration or preferred stock consideration, as applicable, to be provided to the holders of equity interests in the Company and the assumption of all of the Company’s liabilities, and any other applicable amounts, followed by a distribution of such common stock consideration or preferred stock consideration, and any other applicable amounts, to the holders of equity interests in the Company in liquidation of the Company pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code. As a REIT, the Company is generally entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating distributions, and we anticipate that our deemed liquidating distribution will exceed our taxable income recognized as a result of the merger (together with any other undistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the merger). Accordingly, we anticipate that we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain that we recognize in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 62 It is expected the operations merger will be treated as (1) the adoption by Operations of a plan of liquidation followed by (2) a taxable liquidation of Operations pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code. As a REIT, Operations is generally entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating distributions, and we anticipate that Operation’s deemed liquidating distribution will exceed its taxable income recognized as a result of the operations merger (together with any other undistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the operations merger). Accordingly, we anticipate that we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain that Operations recognizes in connection with the operations merger. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the merger and the operations merger will be treated as described above. Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of common stock and preferred stock pursuant to the merger is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation of the Company and a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of shares of common stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received with respect to such U.S. holder’s shares of common stock in the merger, and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of common stock. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of common stock at different times and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares of common stock. Any such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger is greater than one year at the time of the merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. holder who has held shares of common stock for less than six months at the time of the merger, taking into account the holding period rules of Sections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss on the exchange of such shares of common stock in the merger will be treated as recognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received from us, or such holder’s share of any designated retained capital gains, with respect to such shares. Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock General The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of payments made with respect to such non-U.S. holder’s shares of common stock in connection with the merger will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt of such payments is treated as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs pursuant to the provisions of FIRPTA. The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it intends to take the position that under current law a non-U.S. holder’s receipt of a liquidating distribution from a REIT (including payments made in connection with the merger, which as noted, are expected to be treated as distributions in complete liquidation of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is generally subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to the extent attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs. Although legislation effectively overriding Notice 2007-55 has previously been proposed, it is not possible to say if or when any such legislation will be enacted. Accordingly, we intend to take the position that payments made with respect the Company’s shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be subject to tax in accordance with Notice 2007-55, subject to the 10% Exception, as described in more detail below. In general, the provisions governing the taxation of distributions by REITs can be less favorable to non-U.S. holders than the taxation of sales or exchanges of REIT stock by non-U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these provisions. Distribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests To the extent that the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and the 10% Exception described in the next paragraph below does not apply, then, to the extent that payments received by a non-U.S. holder with respect to such non-U.S. holder’s common stock pursuant to the merger are treated as attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of our USRPIs, such amounts will be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder, and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis. A corporate non-U.S. holder will also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty). In addition, 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in the Treasury Regulations) of any such amounts paid to a non-U.S. holder will be withheld and remitted to the IRS. 63 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of our common stock are considered “regularly traded” (within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations) on an established securities market located in the United States and the non-U.S. holder did not hold more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the merger, the tax treatment and consequences described above would not apply (the “10% Exception”), and non-U.S. holders would instead be subject to the rules described below under “- Taxable Sale of Common Stock.” We believe that shares of our common stock are, and will be at the time of the merger, considered regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding tax consequences of the merger to them. Taxable Sale of Common Stock If both (A) the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 were not to apply to a non-U.S. holder’s receipt of payments with respect to such non-U.S. holder’s shares of common stock pursuant to the merger and (B) either (1) the “publicly traded exception” (as described below) applies or (2) we are a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” (as described below), such that the Company’s shares of common stock do not constitute USRPIs under FIRPTA with respect to such non-U.S. holder, then the non-U.S. holder should not be subject to tax on any gain recognized in connection with the receipt of cash consideration payable pursuant to the merger (which, as described above under “ - Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock” and subject to the discussion of Notice 2007-55 above, is generally expected to be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation of the Company and as amounts received in full payment in exchange for such holder’s shares of common stock) unless: (a) the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if required pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States; or (b) the non-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other requirements are met. The “publicly traded exception” applies to a non-U.S. holder if our common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by the applicable Treasury Regulations, and the non-U.S. holder has held 10% or less of the shares of common stock at all times during the shorter of the period that the non- U.S. holder owned such stock or the five-year period ending on the date of the merger. We believe that shares of our common stock are, and will be at the time of the merger, considered regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. We will be a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the time of the merger if non-U.S. holders held directly or indirectly less than 50% in value of shares of our stock at all times during the five-year period ending with the merger. While we believe that the Company has been and currently is domestically controlled as of the date hereof, no assurances can be given that the actual ownership of shares of our stock has been or will be sufficient for us to qualify as a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the time of the merger. A non-U.S. holder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or, if an applicable income tax treaty requires, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be subject to the branch profits tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described above. A non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and who meets certain other requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain recognized in connection with the merger, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder. If a non-U.S. holder’s shares of common stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by such holder on a sale of such stock will be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and, in the case of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation, the branch profits tax as described above). Income Tax Treaties If a non-U.S. holder is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States, the non-U.S. holder may be able to reduce or eliminate certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above, such as the branch profits tax. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisor regarding possible benefits under an applicable income tax treaty. 64 U.S. Withholding Tax As described above, it is not entirely clear whether the receipt of payments pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder will be treated as a sale or exchange of shares of common stock (if Notice 2007-55 does not apply) or as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain from the deemed sale of the Company’s USRPIs in the merger (if Notice 2007-55 does apply and the holder does not qualify for the 10% Exception described above). Accordingly, we intend to withhold, pursuant to FIRPTA, U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in applicable Treasury Regulations) from the portion of the consideration paid to a non-U.S. holder to the extent attributable to gains that the Company recognizes from sales of USRPIs, unless such non-U.S. holder qualifies for the 10% Exception described above. A non-U.S. holder may be entitled to a refund or credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, with respect to any amount withheld pursuant to FIRPTA; provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisor regarding withholding tax considerations. Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Shares of Preferred Stock The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of preferred stock will be treated as a taxable transaction. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares of preferred stock generally will be the same as the consequences to holders of shares of our common stock described above with respect to the merger, except that the capital gain or loss recognized by a holder of shares of preferred stock will be measured by the difference between the amount of cash the holder receives with respect to such U.S. holder’s shares of preferred stock in the merger and such holder’s adjusted tax basis in shares of preferred stock. Consistent with IRS Notice 2007-55 (described above), and without limiting any of the above discussion, 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in U.S. Treasury Regulations) of any cash received by a non-U.S. holder with respect to its preferred stock, which is treated as a distribution attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of our USRPIs, will be withheld and remitted to the IRS unless such holder qualifies for the 10% Exception discussed above. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to payments made in connection with the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a holder of shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock who (1) in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on an IRS Form W-9, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; (2) in the case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes an applicable IRS Form W-8; or (3) provides proof that such holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with other applicable rules and certification requirements.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, so long as such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.

HOLDERS OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The summary of the material terms of the merger agreement below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which we incorporate by reference into this proxy statement. We recommend that you read the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A carefully and in its entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals The “Go-Shop” Period: Solicitation of Competing Proposals Until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the no-shop period start date, we, along with our subsidiaries and our and our subsidiaries’ directors, officers, employees, advisors (including attorneys, accountants, consultants, investment bankers and financial advisers), agents and other representatives (whom we collectively refer to as “representatives”), had the right to: •solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiry, including by providing information (including non-public information) regarding, and affording access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of, us and our subsidiaries to any person (and its representatives, including potential financing sources) pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement; provided that we provided to the Parent Parties any non-public information provided to any person given such access that was not previously made available to the Parent Parties prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it was provided to such person (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter); and •engage in any discussions or negotiations with any persons (and their respective representatives, including potential financing sources) with respect to a competing proposal or potential competing proposal or interest or potential interest with respect thereto, or otherwise cooperate with, assist or participate in, or facilitate any inquiries. Within one business day after the no-shop period start date, we were required to: •notify Parent in writing of the identity of each person from whom we or any of our subsidiaries received a competing proposal after the execution of the merger agreement and prior to the no-shop period start date; •provide Parent a list identifying excluded parties as of the no-shop period start date; and •provide to Parent (1) a copy of any competing proposal made in writing and any other written terms or proposals provided (including financing commitments) to us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any competing proposal and any modifications to the financial and other material terms thereof (which may be redacted to the extent we determine in good faith, after consultation with our outside legal counsel, that such redactions are required by existing contractual obligations to protect confidential information of the business or operations of the person making such competing proposal or inquiry) and (2) a written summary of the material terms and conditions of 80 any competing proposal not made in writing (including any material terms and conditions proposed orally or supplementally and any modifications to the financial and other material terms thereof). Promptly after the no-shop period start date (and, in any event, within 24 hours thereafter), we will, and will cause our subsidiaries and our and their officers and directors to, immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access granted to any person or its representatives (other than the Parent Parties, their respective affiliates and their respective representatives) in connection with any inquiry, competing proposal or its consideration of any competing proposal and request the return or destruction by such person and its representatives of all non-public information concerning us, the Partnership and Operations; provided, that we will not be required to take any such action in respect of any excluded party unless and until such person or group ceases to be an excluded party (in which case all references in this sentence to the no-shop period start date shall be read as the date on which such person or group ceases to be an excluded party). From and after the no-shop period start date, we and our representatives may continue to engage in the activities described in this section “- The “Go-Shop” Period: Solicitation of Competing Proposals” with respect to each excluded party (for so long as such person or group is an excluded party) following the no-shop period start date and prior to obtaining stockholder approval, including with respect to any amended or revised competing proposal that is submitted by an excluded party following the shop period start date, and the restrictions in the section below titled “- The “No-Shop” Period: No Solicitation of Competing Proposals” will not apply with respect to an excluded party (for so long as such person or group is an excluded party). An “excluded party” is a person or group of persons from whom we or any of our representatives have received a written bona fide competing proposal after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the no-shop period start date that our board of directors determined in good faith prior to the no-shop period start date (after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. We refer to such competing proposal as a “qualified proposal.” However, any such person or group of persons will immediately cease to be an excluded party upon the earliest to occur of the following: •such time as such person’s or group of person’s competing proposal expires, is withdrawn, or is terminated (it being understood that any amendment, modification or replacement of such competing proposal will not, in and of itself, be deemed a withdrawal of the competing proposal); •in the case of a group, if the persons in such group as of the time such group submitted the qualified proposal that most recently rendered such group an excluded party cease to constitute in the aggregate at least 75% of the equity financing (measured by voting power or value) of such group, unless the remainder of such equity financing is to be provided by persons who were themselves in a group of persons that was an excluded party prior to the no-shop period start date; and •11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 28, 2022. The “No-Shop” Period: No Solicitation of Competing Proposals From and after the no-shop period start date until the earlier of the closing or the date on which the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, we have agreed that, except as permitted for excluded parties and by certain exceptions described below, we will, and will cause each of our subsidiaries and our and their directors and officers to, and will direct our other representatives to immediately cease any activities, solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any competing proposal or inquiry (as described below). We have further agreed that, except as permitted for excluded parties and by certain exceptions described below, we will not, directly or indirectly: •solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage, provide any non-public information to, or take any other action for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry; •engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry; •enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or other contract (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement) with respect to a competing proposal or that would reasonably be expected to lead to a competing proposal or requiring us to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (any such contract, an “alternative acquisition agreement”); or •resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. 81 At any time on or after the no-shop period start date and prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, we may, directly or indirectly through one or more of our representatives, (1) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish information (including non-public information) relating to us and our subsidiaries or (2) afford access to our and our subsidiaries’ business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, in each case, pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, to, any person or group of persons (including any person or group that ceased to be an excluded party, after such person or group has ceased to be an excluded party, and any such competing proposal will not be deemed to have been solicited by reason of the fact that such person or group was solicited while an excluded party) that has made, renewed or delivered to us a bona fide written competing proposal after the date of the merger agreement and prior to obtaining the stockholder approval (that did not result from a breach of our obligations described under this section “-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals” and in the section entitled “-Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation”) or to such person’s representatives; provided, that: •our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such competing proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal; and •we will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if we take any such actions and, subject to applicable law, any non- public information concerning us or our subsidiaries that is provided to such person or its representatives that was not previously provided to Parent or its representatives will be provided or made available to Parent promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) following such time as it is provided or made available to such person. From and after the no-shop period start date, if we receive a competing proposal or inquiry, we will: •promptly (and in any event no later than 24 hours) after receipt of such competing proposal or inquiry, advise Parent in writing of the receipt of such competing proposal or inquiry, the identity of the person or group making such competing proposal or inquiry and the material terms and conditions thereof, and provide to Parent copies of any such competing proposal or inquiry made in writing and any written documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and correspondence relating thereto); and •keep Parent advised, on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours), of all material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any competing proposal or inquiry and the status of such competing proposal or inquiry, including notifying Parent of any change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of any competing proposal or inquiry and providing Parent copies of any written documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and correspondence relating thereto, except that we may redact the documentation and terms and conditions of any such competing proposal or inquiry, to the extent we determine in good faith, after consultation with our outside legal counsel, that such redactions are required by existing contractual obligations to protect confidential information of the business or operations of the person making such competing proposal or inquiry. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may, after the date of the merger agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit us from providing any information required to be provided to Parent in accordance with the merger agreement. For purposes of the merger agreement, “inquiry” means any inquiry, indication of interest or request for information or discussions from any person or group that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a competing proposal. For purposes of the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means a written competing proposal made by any “person or group” (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act) (except for purposes of this definition, the references in the definition of “competing proposal” to 15% will be replaced with 50%) that our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into consideration (1) all of the terms and conditions of the competing proposal and the merger agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent) and (2) the feasibility and certainty of consummation of such competing proposal on the terms proposed (taking into account all legal, financial, financing, regulatory approvals, conditionality, breakup fee provisions and other aspects of such competing proposal and conditions to consummation thereof that our board of directors deems relevant)) would result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of common stock (solely in their capacities as stockholders) than the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent) and is reasonably likely to be consummated. In addition, the merger agreement provides that we may not, nor may we permit any of our subsidiaries to, release any person from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill or 82 confidentiality provision with respect to a competing proposal or inquiry or similar matter in any contract to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party; provided, that, if our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law, we may grant a limited waiver of any standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit any person to make a non-public competing proposal to our board of directors and, to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, thereafter negotiate and enter into any transaction in connection therewith. The merger agreement also provides that neither we nor our board of directors will take any action to exempt any person (other than any Parent Party or their affiliates) from or render inapplicable the “Aggregate Share Ownership Limit” (including by establishing or increasing an “Excepted Holder Limit”), as such terms are defined in our charter, or any takeover statute, in each case, unless such actions are taken concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with the provisions described in the second bullet point in the section entitled “-Termination of the Merger Agreement- Termination by the Company.” Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation Except in the circumstances and pursuant to the procedures described below, neither our board of directors nor any committee thereof will: •fail to recommend to our stockholders that the stockholder approval be given or fail to include in this proxy statement its recommendation that our common stockholders approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; •change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, its recommendation that our common stockholders approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; •take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer; •adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to or agree to adopt, approve or recommend to our stockholders any competing proposal; or •authorize, cause or permit us or any of our subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement. We refer to any action in the first four bullets above as an “adverse recommendation change.” Prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, if (1) we are not in breach of our obligations described in the section entitled “-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals” in any material respect and under this section “-Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation” and (2) we receive (a) a bona fide written competing proposal prior to 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 28, 2022 from an excluded party or (b) an unsolicited bona fide written competing proposal after the no-shop period start date, in each case, that did not result from a breach of our obligations described in the section entitled “-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals” and under this section “- Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation”, and our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a superior proposal, then our board of directors is permitted to make an adverse recommendation change and/or terminate the merger agreement in accordance with its terms in order to substantially concurrently enter into an alternative acquisition agreement providing for the implementation of such competing proposal (as described in the second bullet in the section entitled “-Termination of the Merger Agreement-Termination by the Company”), if and only if: •our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel), that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law; •we have given Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice of our intention to take such actions (which notice will include the identity of the person or group making such competing proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof, as well as copies of any written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements providing for such superior proposal); •during the three business day period following Parent’s receipt of such notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such third business day (which we refer to as the “match period”), we have negotiated, and caused our representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to propose in writing revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that our board of directors would no longer determine that such competing proposal constitutes a superior proposal or the failure to make an adverse recommendation change and/or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement in response to such superior proposal would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law; and 83",80,83

For purposes of the merger agreement, “intervening event” means a change in circumstances or development occurring or arising after the date of the merger agreement that materially affects the business, assets or operations of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that was not known to or reasonably foreseeable (or, if known, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) by our board of directors prior to the execution of the merger agreement, which change in circumstances or development becomes known to our board of directors prior to the receipt of the stockholder approval; provided, however, that none of the following will constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been an intervening event: •the receipt, existence or terms of any competing proposal, any inquiry or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof; •the fact that, in and of itself, we meet or exceed any internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (provided, however, that the underlying causes of such change will not be excluded by this bullet); •changes in the market price or trading volume of shares of our common stock (provided, however, that the underlying causes of such change will not be excluded by this bullet); or •any event, change, effect, development or occurrence that would fall within any of the exceptions to the definition of a “material adverse effect.” Nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits us, our board of directors or our representatives from: •taking and disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any “stop, look and listen” communication to our stockholders pending disclosure of our position thereunder; provided, that any such disclosure does not contain an adverse recommendation change; 84 •disclosing to our stockholders any factual information regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations or the fact that a competing proposal has been made, the identity of the person making such competing proposal or the material terms of such competing proposal, in each case, that our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our outside legal counsel) that such disclosure is required under applicable law, and disclosure under this bullet will not limit or otherwise affect our or our board of directors’ obligations (or the obligations of any committee thereof) under the merger agreement and no such disclosure will, taken by itself, be deemed to be an adverse recommendation change; or •communicating in writing with any person (or its representatives) to the extent necessary to direct such person to our obligations under the merger agreement; provided, that (1) our board of directors (or any committee thereof) will not make any adverse recommendation change, except in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, and (2) any statement or disclosure made by us or our board of directors (or a committee thereof) pursuant to the preceding three bullets must be subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit us or our board of directors (or any committee thereof) to effect an adverse recommendation change. Employee Benefits From and after the merger effective time and for a period of not less than 12 months after the closing date, solely during any period of employment, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Entities to, provide to each of our and our subsidiaries’ employees who continues employment with Parent, us or our subsidiaries following the merger effective time (each, a “continuing employee”) with (1) a base salary and annual cash bonus opportunity that are each no less favorable than the base salary and annual cash bonus opportunity, in each case, as provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the merger effective time and (2) severance, paid-time off, qualified defined contribution retirement and health insurance benefits that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, than as provided to each such continuing employee immediately prior to the merger effective time.

If we hold such an annual meeting, in order for a stockholder proposal to be properly submitted for presentation at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, which we refer to as the “2022 annual meeting,” and included in the proxy material for the 2022 annual meeting, we must have received written notice of the proposal at our executive offices no later than December 22, 2021. In order for a stockholder to nominate an individual for election to our board of directors, or to present a proposal of other business (other than a proposal to be included in our proxy materials), at the 2022 annual meeting, we must have received written notice of the nomination or proposal during the period that began on November 22, 2021 and ended at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 22, 2021. However, if we hold a 2022 annual meeting and such meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, then we must receive written notice of the nomination or proposal either (1) during the period beginning on the 150th day prior to, and ending at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 120th day prior to, the date of the 2022 annual meeting, or (2) the tenth day following the day on which we first publicly announce the date of the 2022 annual meeting.
