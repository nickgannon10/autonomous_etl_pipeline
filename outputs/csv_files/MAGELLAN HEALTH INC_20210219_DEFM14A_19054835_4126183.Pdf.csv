Under the Merger Agreement, the respective obligations of Magellan, Centene and Merger Sub to complete the
Merger are subject to, among other things, (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any extension
thereof, including any agreement between a party to the Merger Agreement and a governmental authority agreeing
not to consummate the Merger prior to a certain date) applicable to the completion of the Merger under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (which we refer to as the “HSR Act”) (together, such expiration or
termination we refer to as the “HSR Act Clearance”) and (ii) the making of and receipt of, respectively, certain other
specified regulatory filings and consents, including the approval of certain state government insurance and health
authorities for Centene’s acquisition of control of Magellan’s regulated businesses and subsidiaries (which we refer
to as the “required filings” and “required consents”).
On January 8, 2021, Magellan and Centene filed their respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with
respect to the Merger with the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) and Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”), which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period.
On February 8, 2021, the date on which the waiting period was to expire, Centene voluntarily withdrew its notification
and report form, as permitted by the HSR Act and the terms of the Merger Agreement. Centene refiled such form with
the FTC and the DOJ on February 10, 2021. Unless the FTC and DOJ grant early termination of the HSR Act review
period (subject to the FTC and DOJ’s lifting of the current suspension of review period early terminations) or the FTC
or DOJ formally requests additional information concerning the Merger, the waiting period will expire on March 12,
2021.

The closing of the Merger is not conditioned upon Centene’s obtaining any financing.
In connection with the Merger, the parties intend to repay in full and terminate Magellan’s existing credit facility and
effect the release or termination of any liens and guarantees, and the return of any possessory collateral, in
connection with such repayment. In addition, Magellan will use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Centene an
executed waiver letter with respect to its continuing agreement for standby letters of credit that provides for the
waiver of the change of control under such agreement and other defaults or events of default triggered by the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
If requested by Centene, Magellan has agreed to cause its representatives to use its and their commercially
reasonable efforts to reasonably cooperate with Centene to, related to the Company’s 4.400% Senior Notes due 2024
and the related indentures, (i) commence any of (1) one or more offers to purchase any or all of the outstanding series
of such notes for cash or (2) one or more offers to exchange any or all of the outstanding notes for securities issued
by Centene or any of its subsidiaries and (ii) conduct consent solicitations to obtain from the requisite holders
thereof consent to certain amendments to such indentures. Centene has agreed to pay the costs of any such offers to
purchase, offers to exchange or consent solicitations. Centene has not yet determined what, if any, action it will take
with respect to the notes.

As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the Merger Agreement, Magellan has agreed to immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any person that may have been ongoing prior to the date of the Merger
Agreement with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal, as described hereinafter, and to terminate all physical
and electronic data room access previously granted to any such person or its representatives. Magellan has agreed
that it will not, and will cause each of its representatives not to:
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing material non-
public information), or take any other action designed to lead to, the submission by any person of an
alternative acquisition proposal;
•
engage in, continue, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations related to any alternative acquisition proposal (other than to clarify the terms of Magellan’s
no-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement), or provide any material non-public information to
any person in connection with, or related to, any alternative acquisition proposal;
•
approve, endorse or recommend any alternative acquisition proposal;
•
enter into any contract or similar document or commitment related to an alternative acquisition proposal; or
•
release or permit the release of any person from, waive or permit the waiver of any right under, fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any consent or make any election under, any “standstill” or similar
provision of any confidentiality agreement to which Magellan or any of its subsidiaries is a party; except
that, until receipt of the Company stockholder approval, Magellan will be permitted to waive any such
“standstill” or similar provision that prohibits a confidential proposal being made to the Board (or any
committee thereof), in each case, solely to the extent that the Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such waiver would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law and solely to the extent necessary to permit the person bound by
such “standstill” or similar provision to make a confidential alternative acquisition proposal to the Board.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, if the Company
receives a bona fide written alternative acquisition proposal made after the date of the Merger Agreement that
8TABLE OF CONTENTS
does not result from a breach of the Company’s no-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, and if the
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial
advisor) that such alternative acquisition proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior
acquisition proposal, the Company is permitted to:
•
enter into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such alternative acquisition proposal that
contains provisions no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Amended Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger-Background of
the Merger”) (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill
provision to the extent Centene is, concurrently with entry by the Company or any of its subsidiaries into
such confidentiality agreement, released from any standstill provision in its confidentiality agreement with
Magellan);
•
provide information (including nonpublic information), and access to the Company’s and its subsidiaries’
business, assets, books and records, contracts or employees, in response to a request therefor by such
person, subject to the confidentiality agreement described in the immediately preceding bullet point; and
•
engage in discussion or negotiations for such alternative acquisition proposal with such person and its
representatives.

Centene and Magellan. The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by either Centene or Magellan if:
•
the closing has not occurred by 5:00 p.m. on the outside date of October 4, 2021 (which we refer to as the
“outside date”), except that, if, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the outside date, all of the closing

existence of a legal restraint that relates to the HSR Act Clearance or a required consent, or (b) the HSR Act
Clearance, required filings or required consents having been made or obtained and (ii) any condition that
by its nature is to be satisfied at the closing, the outside date will be extended to January 4, 2022, except
that a party may not terminate the Merger Agreement as described in this bullet point if the failure of the
closing to have occurred prior to 5:00 p.m. on the outside date (as it may be extended) was proximately
caused by such party’s breach of, or such party’s failure to perform or comply with, in any material respect,
any of its covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement;
•
any legal restraint is in effect that has become final and nonappealable, except that a party may not

be cured by the date of the special meeting or, if capable of being cured, is not cured within ten (10)
business days after Centene delivers written notice of such breach to the Company; or

accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties or the Company’s compliance with its
covenants and agreements and (2) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the Company or, if
reasonably capable of being cured by the Company, is not cured by the Company prior to the earlier of (a)
thirty (30) days after Centene delivers written notice of such failure to the Company and (b) the outside
date (as it may be extended as described above), except that Centene may not terminate the Merger
Agreement as described in this bullet point if Centene or Merger Sub breach, or fail to perform or comply
with, in any material respect their respective covenants under the Merger Agreement or their respective
representations or warranties fail to be accurate in any material respect, which failure proximately gave rise
to the failure of the closing conditions described herein.
The Company may also terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time if:
•
(i) the Board has authorized the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement in response to a superior
acquisition proposal in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the provisions
described under “The Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-No Solicitation-Change of

under the second bullet set forth under Centene’s termination rights above and (iii) concurrently with such
termination, a written definitive agreement providing for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by such superior acquisition proposal is duly executed and delivered by the Company, the
person making such superior acquisition proposal and all other parties thereto, except that the Company
may not terminate the Merger Agreement as described in this bullet point, and no such purported
termination will have any effect, unless the Company pays Centene the applicable termination fee described
in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees,” beginning on page 83; or
•
either Centene or Merger Sub breaches, or fails to perform or comply with, any of its covenants or
agreements under the Merger Agreement, or any of Centene’s or Merger Sub’s respective representations
or warranties under the Merger Agreement fails to be accurate, which failure (1) would give rise to the
failure of a closing condition regarding the accuracy of Centene’s and Merger Sub’s representations and
warranties or Centene’s and Merger Sub’s compliance with their respective covenants and agreements and
(2) is not reasonably capable of being cured by Centene or Merger Sub or, if reasonably capable of being
cured by Centene or Merger Sub, is not cured by Centene or Merger Sub, as applicable, prior to the earlier

date (as it may be extended as described above), except that the Company may not terminate the Merger
Agreement as described in this bullet point if the Company breaches, or fails to perform or comply with, in
any material respect its covenants under the Merger Agreement or its representations or warranties fail to

Under Delaware law, if the Merger is completed, holders of Magellan common stock who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and who otherwise properly exercise their appraisal rights will be entitled to seek
appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for, the judicially determined fair value of, their shares of Magellan common
stock, in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration. The “fair value” could be higher or lower than, or the same as,
the Merger Consideration. The relevant provisions of the DGCL are included as Annex E to this proxy statement.
Magellan stockholders are encouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Moreover, due to the
complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, Magellan stockholders who are considering
exercising that right are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
10TABLE OF CONTENTS
counsel. Failure to comply strictly with these provisions may result in the loss of the right of appraisal. For additional
information, see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 97.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined below in the section entitled
“The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s
shares of Magellan common stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount
measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and
such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Magellan common stock surrendered in the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of
shares of Magellan common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to
the United States. For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 72.
Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating
to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-
income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. The U.S. federal, state, local and
foreign income and other tax consequences to holders or beneficial owners of options or other equity awards
participating in the Merger or other transactions in connection with the Merger with respect to such options or
equity awards are not discussed herein, and such holders or beneficial owners of options are strongly encouraged
to consult their own tax advisors regarding such tax consequences.

The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the
special meeting of stockholders and the Merger. These questions and answers do not address all questions that may
be important to you as a Magellan stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere
in this proxy statement, the Annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement.
Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
A:
On January 4, 2021, Magellan entered into the Merger Agreement with Centene and Merger Sub. You are
receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board in favor of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Q:
As a stockholder, what will I receive in the Merger?
A:
If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $95.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of
Magellan common stock you own as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For further information, see the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration Received by Magellan Stockholders,” beginning
on page 77.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?
A:
If you are a U.S. Holder (as such term is defined below in the section entitled “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of shares of Magellan common stock for cash
pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will
require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Magellan common stock surrendered in the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section entitled “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the
exchange of shares of Magellan common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain
connections to the United States.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine
the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances
(including with respect to any tax consequences to holders or beneficial owners of options or other equity
awards participating in the Merger or transactions in connection with the Merger with respect to such options
or equity awards) and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state,
local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the Merger is provided below under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 72.
Q:
What will happen to outstanding Magellan equity compensation awards in the Merger?
A:
For information regarding the treatment of outstanding Magellan equity awards, see the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement-Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards; Company ESPP,” beginning on page 78.
Q:
What will happen to the Company ESPP?
A:
For information regarding the treatment of Company ESPP, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards; Company ESPP,” beginning on page 78.
Q:
When and where will the special meeting of stockholders be held?
A:
The special meeting of Magellan stockholders will be held via live webcast on March 31, 2021, at 8:30 a.m.,
Central Time. The special meeting can be accessed by visiting
12TABLE OF CONTENTS
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MGLN2021SM, where you will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote
online. We encourage you to allow ample time for online check-in, which will open at 8:15 a.m., Central Time.
Please note that you will not be able to attend the virtual special meeting in person.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
Only holders of record of Magellan common stock as of the close of business on February 12, 2021, the record
date for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. You will be entitled to
one vote on each of the proposals presented in this proxy statement for each share of Magellan common stock
that you held as of the close of business on the record date.
Q:
What proposals will be considered at the special meeting?
A:
At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on:
•
a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to Magellan’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as
discussed in the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger,” beginning on page 65; and
•
a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate, including
to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve each of the proposals?
A:
The proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Magellan common stock entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting. Abstentions and
failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The approval of the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of shares of Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting
website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. Although the Board intends to consider the
vote resulting from this proposal, the vote is advisory only and, therefore, is not binding on Magellan or
Centene or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Magellan
stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger
will be payable to our named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved. Failure to vote will have no
effect on approval of the proposal; however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal.
The approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of shares of Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual
meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. In addition, even if a quorum is not
present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the shares of Magellan
common stock present, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such
matter may adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time. Failure to vote will have no effect on approval of
the proposal; however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
A:
After careful consideration, the Board has unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, directed that the
Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption, and unanimously
recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the non-binding
Merger-related compensation proposal and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or
appropriate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the adoption of the
Merger Agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger-Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the
Merger Agreement,” beginning on page 43. In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Board with
respect to the Merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of Magellan stockholders generally. See the section entitled “The
Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 65.
Q:
Do I need to attend the special meeting?
A:
No. It is not necessary for you to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. If you are a
stockholder of record as of the record date, you may vote by mail, by telephone or through the internet, as
described in more detail below. If you are a “street name” holder of shares, you must follow the voting
instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee for your shares to be voted at the
special meeting, as described in more detail below.
Q:
How many shares of Magellan common stock need to be represented at the special meeting?
A:
The presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of
shares of Magellan common stock representing a majority of the votes which all holders of shares of Magellan
common stock are entitled to cast constitutes a quorum for the purpose of considering the proposals. As of
February 12, 2021, there were 25,965,226 shares of Magellan common stock outstanding. If you are a Magellan
stockholder as of the close of business on the record date and you vote by mail, by telephone, through the
internet or at the special meeting via the virtual meeting website, you will be considered part of the quorum. If
you are a “street name” holder of shares of Magellan common stock and you provide your bank, broker, trust or
other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of Magellan common stock and you do not provide your
bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum.
All shares of Magellan common stock held by stockholders that attend the special meeting via the virtual
meeting website, or are represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting, regardless of how such
shares are voted or whether such stockholders have indicated on their proxy that they are abstaining from
voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the special
meeting may be adjourned.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be
paid or become payable to Magellan’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger?
A:
In July 2010, the SEC adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding advisory vote to approve
certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the Merger. In accordance with the rules promulgated under
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Magellan is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-
binding advisory vote on compensation that may be paid or become payable to Magellan’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger. For additional information, see the section entitled “Proposal 2: Non-
Binding Merger-Related Compensation Proposal,” beginning on page 27.
Q:
What will happen if Magellan stockholders do not approve the non-binding Merger-related compensation
proposal?
A:
The vote to approve the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from
the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Approval of the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal is
not a condition to completion of the Merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning that it will not be binding
on Magellan or Centene or any of their respective subsidiaries. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is
adopted by Magellan’s stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our named executive officers even if this proposal is not
approved.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the Annexes
attached to this proxy statement, please vote your shares of Magellan common stock in one of the ways
described below as soon as possible. You will be entitled to one vote for each share of Magellan common stock
that you owned on the record date.
Q:
How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?
A:
You may vote by:
•
submitting your proxy by completing, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it
by mail in the enclosed prepaid envelope;
•
submitting your proxy by using the telephone number printed on each proxy card you receive;
•
submitting your proxy through the internet voting instructions printed on each proxy card you
receive; or
•
casting your vote at the special meeting via the virtual meeting website. Any stockholder can attend
the special meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MGLN2021SM, where
stockholders will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote online. The special meeting starts at
8:30 a.m., Central Time. We encourage you to allow ample time for online check-in, which will open at
8:15 a.m., Central Time. Please have your 16-digit control number to join the special meeting.
Instructions on who can attend and participate via internet, including how to demonstrate proof of
stock ownership, are posted at www.proxyvote.com.
If you are submitting your proxy by telephone or through the internet, your voting instructions must be
received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on March 30, 2021.
If your shares of Magellan common stock are purchased through the Company ESPP and are held through your
account with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you must vote such shares by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
March 26, 2021.
Submitting your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet will not prevent you from casting your vote
at the special meeting via the virtual meeting website. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, by
telephone or through the internet even if you plan to attend the special meeting via the virtual meeting website
to ensure that your shares of Magellan common stock are represented at the special meeting.
If you return your signed proxy card, but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares will
be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the approval of the non-binding Merger-
related compensation proposal and “FOR” the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if
necessary or appropriate.
Q:
If my shares are held for me by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, will my bank, broker, trust or other
nominee vote those shares for me with respect to the proposals?
A:
Your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT have the power to vote your shares of Magellan common
stock at the special meeting unless you provide instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how
to vote. You should instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote your shares with respect
to the proposals, using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. You may be able
to vote by telephone or through the internet if your bank, broker, trust or other nominee offers these options.
Q:
What if I fail to instruct my bank, broker, trust or other nominee how to vote?
A:
Your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote your shares of Magellan common stock
unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Because the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Magellan common stock, the failure to provide your nominee with voting instructions will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, your
shares of Magellan common stock will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares present at the
special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.

bearing a date later than the date of the proxy delivered to David Haddock, Secretary, Magellan Health, Inc., 4801
E. Washington Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85034. You may also revoke your proxy or change your vote by
submitting another proxy by telephone or through the internet in accordance with the instructions on the
enclosed proxy card. You may also submit a later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares. If you voted by
completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, you should retain a copy of the voter control
number found on the proxy card in the event that you later decide to revoke your proxy or change your vote by
telephone or through the internet. Alternatively, your proxy may be revoked or changed by attending the special
meeting via the virtual meeting website and voting at the meeting. However, simply attending the special
meeting without voting will not revoke or change your proxy. “Street name” holders of shares of Magellan
common stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to
revoke or change their proxies.
If you have instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote your shares of Magellan common stock,
you must follow the instructions received from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your vote.
All properly submitted proxies received by us before the special meeting that are not revoked or changed prior
to being exercised at the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions
indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions were provided, “FOR” each of the proposals.
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?
A:
If you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares of Magellan common stock that are
registered in more than one account. For example, if you own your shares in various registered forms, such as
jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and you will need to
sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record
ownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of Magellan common stock are voted, you will need to
submit your proxies by mailing in each proxy card you receive or by telephone or through the internet by using
the different voter control number(s) on each proxy card.
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two
or more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides
advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate
notice of the meeting and proxy card. This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate information
and reduces printing and mailing expenses. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of Magellan
common stock, you may have already received a householding notification. For additional information, see the
section entitled “Householding of Proxy Material,” beginning on page 106.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Magellan common stock before the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of completion of the Merger. If you own
shares of Magellan common stock as of the close of business on the record date but transfer your shares prior
to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but the right to receive the
Merger Consideration will pass to the person who holds your shares as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.
Q:
May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?
A:
Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL. Under Delaware law, holders of record of shares of Magellan common stock who do not vote in favor of
adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed. Appraisal rights only will be
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
available to these holders if they deliver a written demand for an appraisal to Magellan prior to the vote on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting and they comply with the procedures and
requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal
amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive
under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex E to this
proxy statement. For additional information, see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page 97.
Q:
If I hold my shares of Magellan common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. Shortly after the Merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal that includes detailed written
instructions on how to return your stock certificates. You must return your stock certificates in accordance with
such instructions in order to receive the Merger Consideration. PLEASE DO NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK
CERTIFICATE(S) NOW.
Q:
Should I send in my Company Options, Company PSUs, Company RSAs, Company Director RSAs, Company
RSUs and Company PCU awards?
A:
No. Shortly after the Merger is completed, your Company Options, Company PSUs, Company RSAs, Company
Director RSAs, Company RSUs and Company PCUs will be automatically exchanged.
Q:
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
A:
We and Centene are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. We currently anticipate that
the Merger will be completed during the second half of 2021, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions
to the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived. The Merger cannot be completed until the
conditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived), including the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by Magellan stockholders. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Conditions to the Merger,” beginning on page 80.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is not approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Magellan common stock entitled to vote on the matter or if the Merger is not completed for any other
reason, you will not receive any consideration from Centene or Merger Sub for your shares of Magellan common
stock. Instead, Magellan will remain a public company, and Magellan common stock will continue to be
registered under the Exchange Act and listed and traded on the NASDAQ. We expect that our management will
operate our business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that holders of shares of
Magellan common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are
currently subject with respect to their ownership of Magellan common stock. Under certain circumstances, if the
Merger is not completed, we may be obligated to pay Centene a termination fee. For additional information, see
the section entitled “The Merger-Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed,” beginning on page 72.
Q:
Are there any requirements if I plan on attending the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will be held via live webcast only. Any stockholder can attend the special meeting by
visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MGLN2021SM, where stockholders will be able to listen to the
meeting live and vote online. The special meeting starts at 8:30 a.m., Central Time, on March 31, 2021. We
encourage you to allow ample time for online check-in, which will open at 8:15 a.m., Central Time. If you are a
stockholder of record of shares of Magellan common stock, in order to be able to enter the special meeting you
will need the 16-digit control number included on your proxy card. If you hold your shares in “street name,” in
order to be able to enter the special meeting you will need the 16-digit control number included with your voting
instruction card and voting instructions you received from your broker, bank or other nominee of your shares.
Instructions on how to attend and participate online are also posted online at www.proxyvote.com.

At the special meeting, Magellan’s stockholders of record will be asked to consider and vote on:
•
A proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
certain specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into Magellan, with Magellan continuing as
the Surviving Corporation;
•
A proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to Magellan’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as
discussed in the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,”
beginning on page 65; and
•
A proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate, including to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.",29,29
MAGELLAN HEALTH INC_20210219_DEFM14A_19054835_4126183.Pdf,Recommendation of the Board,"Recommendation of the Board
The Board carefully reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. By a unanimous vote, the Board (i) approved and
declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
its stockholders, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for
adoption and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Board also unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal and
“FOR” the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.",29,29

Each holder of record of shares of Magellan common stock as of the close of business on February 12, 2021, which is
the record date for the special meeting, is entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. You will be
entitled to one vote for each share of Magellan common stock that you owned on the record date. As of February 12,
2021, there were 25,965,226 shares of Magellan common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the
special meeting. The presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of
the holders of shares of Magellan common stock representing a majority of the votes which all holders of shares of
Magellan common stock are entitled to cast constitutes a quorum for the special meeting.
If you are a Magellan stockholder of record and you vote by mail, by telephone or through the internet or at the
special meeting via the virtual meeting website, then your shares of Magellan common stock will be counted as
21TABLE OF CONTENTS
part of the quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of Magellan common stock and you provide your
bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of Magellan common stock and you do not provide
your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum.
All shares of Magellan common stock held by stockholders of record that are present at the special meeting via the
virtual meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting, regardless of how such
shares are voted or whether such stockholders abstain from voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the special meeting may be adjourned.
Vote Required for Approval",29,30
MAGELLAN HEALTH INC_20210219_DEFM14A_19054835_4126183.Pdf,Vote Required for Approval,"Vote Required for Approval
Merger Agreement Proposal. The proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Magellan common stock entitled to vote on such matter.
Non-Binding Merger-Related Compensation Proposal. The approval of the non-binding Merger-related
compensation proposal requires, assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by
proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. The vote is advisory only and, therefore, is not binding on Magellan or
Centene or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger is approved by Magellan stockholders and the
Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our
named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.
Adjournment Proposal. The approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Magellan common stock present at the special meeting,
whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. In addition, even if a
quorum is not present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the shares of
Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by
proxy, entitled to vote on such matter may adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time.",30,30
MAGELLAN HEALTH INC_20210219_DEFM14A_19054835_4126183.Pdf,Effect of Abstentions; Broker Non-Votes,"Effect of Abstentions; Broker Non-Votes
The proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Magellan common stock entitled to vote on such matter. Therefore, the failure to vote or the
abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The approval of the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares of Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or
represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. Consequently, failure to vote will have no effect on approval of
the proposal. However, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.
The proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares of Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or
represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. Consequently, failure to vote will have no effect on approval of
the proposal; however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal. In
addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority
of the shares of Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or
represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter may adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time.
A broker non-vote with respect to Magellan common stock occurs when (i) shares of Magellan common stock held
by a broker or other nominee are represented, in person or by proxy, at a meeting of Magellan stockholders, (ii) the
bank, broker or other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner on a particular proposal
and (iii) the bank, broker or other nominee does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares of Magellan
common stock on a particular proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals. A bank, broker, trust
or other nominee may exercise discretion in voting on routine matters but may
22TABLE OF CONTENTS
not exercise discretion and therefore will not vote on non-routine matters if instructions are not given. Under
applicable stock exchange rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. As a result, there
will not be any broker non-votes at the special meeting.
Accordingly, if your shares of Magellan common stock are held in “street name,” a bank, broker, trust or other
nominee will NOT be able to vote your shares, and your shares will not be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Because the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Magellan common stock, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Because the approval of
each of (1) the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special
meeting if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the shares
present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on
such matter, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on
either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have no
effect on approval of those proposals.
How to Vote
Stockholders have a choice of voting by proxy by completing a proxy card and mailing it in the prepaid envelope
provided, by calling a toll-free telephone number or through the internet. Please refer to your proxy card or the
information forwarded by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to see which options are available to you. The
telephone and internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on March 30,
2021.
If your shares of Magellan common stock are purchased through the Company ESPP and are held through your
account with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you must vote such shares by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on March
26, 2021.
If you submit your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet voting procedures, but do not include “FOR,”
“AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on a proposal to be voted, your shares will be voted in favor of that proposal. If you
indicate “ABSTAIN” on a proposal to be voted, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” that proposal. If
you wish to vote by proxy and your shares are held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you must follow the
voting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. Unless you give your bank, broker,
trust or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares of Magellan common stock, your bank, broker, trust
or other nominee will not be able to vote your shares on the proposals.
If you wish to vote by attending the special meeting via the virtual meeting website and your shares are held in the
name of a bank, broker or other holder of record, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from the bank,
broker or other holder of record authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. Obtaining a legal proxy may take
several days.
If you do not submit a proxy or otherwise vote your shares of Magellan common stock in any of the ways described
above, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have
no effect on the approval of the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal or the approval of the proposal
to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate.
If you have any questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your shares of Magellan common stock,
you may contact our proxy solicitor, MacKenzie Partners, toll-free at (800) 322-2885 or collect at (212) 929-5500, or via
email at proxy@mackenziepartners.com.
YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. A letter of transmittal
with instructions for the surrender of certificates representing Converted Shares will be mailed to holders of record of
certificates representing Converted Shares if the Merger is completed.

by submitting a later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares of Magellan common stock; or

by attending the special meeting via the virtual meeting website and voting at the meeting (your attendance
at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy; you must vote at the special meeting via the

Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed one or more times to a later
day or time if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Your shares of Magellan common stock will be voted on any adjournment proposal in
accordance with the instructions indicated in your proxy or, if no instructions were provided, “FOR” the proposal.
If a quorum is present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned by the affirmative vote of a

special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the shares of Magellan common stock
present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on
such matter may adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time. In either case, the adjourned meeting may take
place without further notice other than by an announcement made at the special meeting unless the adjournment is
for more than thirty (30) days thereafter or, if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote
at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, or if a quorum is present at the special
meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement, then
Magellan may seek to adjourn the special meeting. In addition, the Board may, after consultation with Centene,
postpone the special meeting upon public announcement made prior to the date previously scheduled for the special
meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or as otherwise permitted under the Merger Agreement.

In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our stockholders the opportunity to cast a
vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Magellan’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as disclosed in the section
entitled “The Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation,”
beginning on page 69, including the table in such section and accompanying footnotes.
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon Magellan or the Board, and approval of this proposal is not a
condition to completion of the Merger. Because the Merger-related executive compensation to be paid in connection
with the Merger is based on the terms of the Merger Agreement as well as the contractual arrangements between
Magellan and the named executive officers, such compensation may be paid or become payable, regardless of the
outcome of this advisory vote, if the Merger Agreement is adopted (subject only to the contractual conditions in the
Merger Agreement applicable thereto as well as any applicable contractual arrangements between Magellan and the
named executive officers). Accordingly, you are asked to vote on the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Magellan Health, Inc. approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Magellan Health, Inc. that is
based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the
heading “The Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation,”
beginning on page 69 (which disclosure includes the Golden Parachute Compensation Table required pursuant to
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”
The Board unanimously recommends that Magellan stockholders vote “FOR” the non-binding Merger-related
compensation proposal.
If you return a properly executed proxy card, but do not indicate instructions on your proxy card, your shares of
Magellan common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the non-binding Merger-related
compensation proposal.
The approval of the non-binding Merger-related compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares of Magellan common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or
represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. The vote is advisory only and, therefore, not binding on
Magellan or Centene or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Magellan’s
stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will
be paid or become payable to our named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Centene
Corporation (“Centene”) and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
“Shares”), of Magellan Health, Inc. (the “Company”) of the $95.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 4, 2021 (the “Agreement”), by and among
Centene, Mayflower Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Centene, and the Company.
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,
sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for
various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities
they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time
purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,
currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Centene, any of their respective
affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the
Agreement (the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in
connection with the Transaction, all of which are contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the
Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may
arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the
Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may
receive, compensation. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the
Company, Centene and their respective affiliates for which our Investment Banking Division may receive
compensation.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to
stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five years ended December 31, 2019; certain
interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications
from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our
use by the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of
the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; compared certain financial
and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the Healthcare
industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed
with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we
have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent

MAGELLAN HEALTH INC_20210219_DEFM14A_19054835_4126183.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.
The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board, or the
representatives of each company, their respective advisors or any other persons.
Magellan’s senior management team and the Board regularly review and discuss Magellan’s performance, prospects
and strategies for future growth. These reviews have included evaluation of potential opportunities to strengthen
Magellan’s competitive position and enhance stockholder value through organic growth, acquisitions, investments
and other transactions with participants in the managed care and broader healthcare industries.
In addition, over the past several years, the Board has considered other strategic alternatives as a means to enhance
stockholder value. These alternatives have included the potential sale of all of Magellan or certain of its segments or
businesses and the separation of the Company’s healthcare segment (which we refer to as “Healthcare”) and
pharmacy management segment (which we refer to as “Pharmacy Management”), in some cases together with a sale
of one of the separated segments in so-called “morris trust” or “reverse morris trust” transactions. In this regard,
prior to late 2018, Magellan had received a number of unsolicited indications of interest and preliminary proposals
from private equity sponsors (which we refer to as “sponsors”), on behalf of themselves and/or their portfolio
companies, and corporate industry participants (which we refer to as “strategics”), regarding extraordinary
transactions involving the entire Company or individual parts. In certain of these instances, Magellan engaged
financial and legal advisors to assist it in assessing the third party’s interest, had preliminary discussions with the
interested parties and, following the execution of confidentiality agreements, provided access to confidential
information regarding Magellan. None of these approaches resulted in any definitive proposals with respect to a
transaction.
On December 13, 2018, Starboard Value LP (which we refer to as “Starboard”), a New York-based investment adviser,
announced in a Schedule 13D filing with the SEC that it was the beneficial owner of approximately 9.8% of the
outstanding shares of Magellan common stock. In its filing, Starboard disclosed, among other things, its belief that
the shares of Magellan common stock were undervalued and represented an attractive investment opportunity.
In late 2018, Michael Neidorff, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Centene, contacted Barry Smith,
then the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Magellan, by telephone to indicate that Centene may be interested
in exploring a potential acquisition of Magellan. Mr. Neidorff did not make a proposal but indicated that Centene
intended to move quickly and would only need to conduct a limited due diligence review of Magellan before being in
a position to decide whether to make a proposal. In that regard, Mr. Neidorff asked that the Company enter into a
confidentiality agreement with Centene for the purpose of Magellan’s furnishing limited non-public information to
Centene. Mr. Neidorff also noted that Centene would be unwilling to be a participant in any organized sales process
that Magellan might determine to pursue.
Mr. Smith informed the Board of his conversation with Mr. Neidorff and Centene’s potential interest at a meeting held
on December 29, 2018. Present at the meeting were representatives of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP (which we refer to
as “Weil”), counsel to the Company, and Goldman Sachs, the financial advisor retained by the Company in
connection with Starboard’s ownership position and Centene’s potential interest in the Company. At
29TABLE OF CONTENTS
this meeting, the Board determined to explore Centene’s interest as a means of potentially maximizing value on behalf
of the Company’s stockholders and authorized the Company to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Centene in
order to keep the parties’ discussions confidential and to facilitate Centene’s due diligence review.
On January 8, 2019, Magellan entered into a confidentiality agreement with Centene (which we refer to as the
“Confidentiality Agreement”). The Confidentiality Agreement included a standstill provision but did not prohibit
Centene from making confidential acquisition proposals to Magellan. Subsequent to the execution of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Magellan furnished Centene certain non-public information regarding its businesses.
Also on January 8, 2019, the Board, together with the Company’s legal and financial advisors, held a meeting and
reviewed certain of the information to be made available to Centene. At that meeting, Mr. Smith reported on telephone
calls he had received from three other parties, each of which had separately expressed a potential interest in Magellan
should the Company determine to explore a possible sale or other extraordinary transaction, although none had
provided any specifics beyond these general statements of interest. Mr. Smith also discussed a follow-up call he had
received from Mr. Neidorff during which Mr. Neidorff reiterated Centene’s potential interest in exploring a potential
acquisition of Magellan. Following these discussions, the Board authorized Goldman Sachs to contact Centene’s
financial advisor, as had been requested by Mr. Neidorff.
On March 3, 2019, the Board met, among other things, to continue its assessment of the possible interest of Centene
and other parties and to determine next steps. At that meeting, Mr. Smith reported on his most recent discussions
with Mr. Neidorff. Mr. Smith noted that Mr. Neidorff had informed him that the current market price of Magellan
common stock following the release of full year-2018 results was such that Centene would not be in a position to
offer to pay a premium for the shares of Magellan common stock. Mr. Smith stated that he had told Mr. Neidorff that,
if Centene nevertheless wished to submit an indication of its interest, it should do so. In response, Mr. Neidorff
indicated to Mr. Smith that Centene would not do so at this time and instead would wait to see if the current market
environment changed in the coming weeks.
Following Mr. Smith’s report on Centene, the Magellan directors engaged in a discussion with Weil and Goldman
Sachs concerning the process alternatives available to the Board to best explore potential transactions with those
third parties that had most recently expressed an interest in the Company, as well as with other potential buyers of all
or parts of the Company. Following a discussion and consideration of the potential positives and negatives
associated with the various alternatives, the Board authorized and directed Goldman Sachs to conduct a broad
confidential outreach (which we refer to as the “Broad Outreach”) to strategics and sponsors potentially having an
interest in, and possessing the capabilities to execute on, a transaction involving all or part of the Company. In this
outreach, the Board instructed Goldman Sachs to highlight its desire to maximize value for Magellan stockholders and
to indicate that interested parties would be welcome to submit proposals for the whole Company or individual parts,
including Healthcare and Pharmacy Management.
On March 4, 2019, Goldman Sachs commenced contacting third parties, including Centene and the three other parties
that had contacted Mr. Smith on an unsolicited basis. Centene informed Goldman Sachs that it was not interested in
participating in the process. A total of 34 parties expressed potential interest in the Company, with 24 of those parties
entering into confidentiality agreements with Magellan. Those confidentiality agreements, with certain exceptions,
included standstill provisions that prohibited the third party from requesting waivers of the standstill restrictions.
The parties entering into confidentiality agreements with Magellan received certain materials regarding the Company
and details concerning the process contemplated to be undertaken pursuant to the Broad Outreach and such parties
were requested to submit “first round” indications of interest on March 27, 2019.
On March 27, 2019, Magellan received indications of interest from nine parties. Of these nine parties, Magellan
invited eight to advance to the “second round” of the Broad Outreach to complete due diligence, participate in
management presentations and formulate definitive proposals. Of the eight parties, four indicated an interest in
acquiring the entire Company, two indicated an interest in acquiring Healthcare and two submitted indications
regarding Pharmacy Management. One strategic, Molina Healthcare, Inc. (which we refer to as “Molina”), was not
advanced as its interest was limited only to the portion of the Company’s Healthcare business that contracts with
state Medicaid agencies and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to manage care for beneficiaries under
various Medicare programs (which we refer to as “Magellan Complete Care” or the Company’s “MCC Business”).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Molina was later invited back into the process to conduct detailed due diligence on the MCC Business. In addition,
during the second round of the Broad Outreach, Magellan received interest from four additional parties, one of which
was invited into the process in connection with its interest in Pharmacy Management.
On March 28, 2019, following the approval and authorization of the Board, Magellan announced that it had entered
into an agreement (which we refer to as the “Starboard Agreement”) with Starboard and certain of its affiliates.
Pursuant to the Starboard Agreement, among other things, Magellan agreed to (i) increase the size of the Board from
nine directors to 13 directors, (ii) appoint to the Board four individuals (which we refer to as the “Appointed
Directors”) from the slate of candidates that Starboard had previously announced it would nominate for election as
directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting to fill the resulting vacancies, (iii) nominate the Appointed Directors for
election as members of the Board at the Company’s 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (which we refer to as the
“2019 Annual Meeting”) and (iv) decrease the size of the Board from 13 to 10 directors effective immediately
following the election of directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting. In addition, Magellan agreed to form a strategic
committee of the Board to review corporate strategy (which we refer to as the “Strategic Committee”) and to appoint
to this committee Peter Feld and Steven Shulman, two of the Appointed Directors, as well as two incumbent directors
to be determined by the Board. Subsequent to the entry into the Starboard Agreement, two of Magellan’s incumbent
directors determined not to stand for re-election at, and one other incumbent director determined to retire immediately
after, the 2019 Annual Meeting.
In connection with the second round of the Broad Outreach, Magellan opened a virtual dataroom to interested
parties that remained open through June 2019, made management presentations, conducted due diligence question
and answer sessions and prepared, made available and discussed draft transaction documents for each of the various
transactions that were under consideration.
On June 6, 2019, the date set for submission of second round proposals, Magellan received revised proposals from
three of the interested parties, with the rest of the participants declining to continue in the process. One proposal
submitted by a sponsor (which we refer to as “Sponsor A”) was to acquire the Company, and the other two were to
acquire Pharmacy Management. Representatives of Sponsor A indicated to representatives of the Company’s
financial advisor that Sponsor A’s proposal was conditioned on its ability to enter into a definitive agreement to sell
Pharmacy Management to one of the other two bidders at an acceptable minimum price. Subsequent to Magellan’s
receipt of Sponsor A’s proposal, it became evident to the Company that Sponsor A also envisioned entering into a
receipt of Sponsor A’s proposal, it became evident to the Company that Sponsor A also envisioned entering into a
definitive agreement with Molina to sell the MCC Business at or about the time it entered into a definitive merger
agreement to acquire the Company. Following review by the Strategic Committee and the Board with the Company’s
legal and financial advisors, it was determined that Sponsor A’s proposal was an attractive and superior proposal and
agreed to Sponsor A’s request for a limited period of exclusivity (which would not preclude the Company from
negotiating and entering into agreements with the other two bidders for a sale of Pharmacy Management) to complete
its due diligence and attempt to negotiate the multi-party transaction contemplated by its proposal.
Following its receipt of Sponsor A’s revised proposal through the end of July 2019, representatives of Magellan and
its advisors spent extensive periods of time providing due diligence access and responses to questions to Sponsor A
and its financing sources, the potential buyer of Pharmacy Management and Molina. During this time period, in
addition to negotiations conducted directly by Sponsor A with the potential buyer of Pharmacy Management and
Molina, Magellan and its advisors also spent considerable time and effort engaged in negotiations with Sponsor A, a
potential buyer of Pharmacy Management and, to a lesser extent, Molina as the potential buyer of the MCC Business,
in an attempt to facilitate an agreement on terms for the envisioned multi-party transaction. The Strategic Committee
and the Board held multiple meetings during June and July 2019 to receive progress updates on the potential
transactions and to provide direction to Magellan’s management and advisors. Notwithstanding these efforts, at a
meeting held on July 29, 2019, the Board determined to terminate negotiations with Sponsor A and the other
interested parties due to its low level of confidence that terms for the multi-party transaction would be agreed to by
the four parties and concerns that distraction of the Company’s senior management team due to the extensive time
commitments required by the process could harm the continued operation of the Company’s businesses.
Also at the July 29, 2019 Board meeting, Mr. Smith notified the directors that he intended to retire, but that he would
continue to serve as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board for a period required to ensure
a smooth transition. At that meeting, Steven Shulman was elected Chairman of the Board.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 11, 2019, Sponsor A submitted an unsolicited revised proposal (which we refer to as the “September
2019 proposal”) to acquire the Company and asked that Magellan and its advisors re-engage for the purposes of
completing the transaction. Sponsor A’s proposal contemplated that it would enter into a definitive agreement for the
sale of the MCC Business with Molina at the same time as it entered into a definitive merger agreement with the
Company. Unlike its previous proposal, the September 2019 proposal did not contemplate an agreement with a buyer
of Pharmacy Management. Based in part on Sponsor A’s assurances that few issues remained open between it and
Molina and that it could complete the work necessary to execute and deliver definitive transaction documents and
arrange financing quickly, the Board authorized management and its advisors to re-engage with Sponsor A.
In September 2019, Magellan re-opened its virtual dataroom to Sponsor A, its financing sources and Molina and also
discussed and negotiated open points with Sponsor A on the transaction documentation. On October 11, 2019,
Sponsor A submitted a revised proposal (which we refer to as the “October 2019 proposal”) to acquire Magellan.
Unlike the September 2019 proposal, the October 2019 proposal was conditioned on a sale by Sponsor A of Pharmacy
Management to the party that had been negotiating in July 2019 with Sponsor A and the Company for the purchase
of that business. The October 2019 proposal also reflected a price reduction from the September 2019 proposal, which
Sponsor A stated was a reflection of unfavorable conditions in the financing markets, changes in customer pipeline
and additional tax liabilities due to the impact of the sales of the MCC Business and Pharmacy Management.
Following a review of the October 2019 proposal by the Strategic Committee and the Board, it was determined that
Magellan and its advisors would communicate to Sponsor A a minimum per share price that would be acceptable to
the Board and a deadline by which definitive transaction documents would need to be executed. On October 18, 2019,
a representative of Sponsor A informed Goldman Sachs that the financing terms available would not allow it to pay a
price that would be acceptable to the Board. Following this communication, Magellan terminated discussions with
Sponsor A.
At various times during the Broad Outreach, Sponsor A modified orally and in writing the prices at which it was
interested in acquiring the entire Company. At no point did Sponsor A indicate an interest in acquiring Magellan at a
per share price in excess of $75.00, the maximum per share price offered by Sponsor A to Magellan during the parties’
negotiations, and Sponsor A’s final proposed per share offer price prior to the termination of discussions was less
than $75.00.
On October 31, 2019, Magellan issued a press release announcing the appointment of Kenneth Fasola as Chief
Executive Officer of the Company, effective November 14, 2019. In connection with Mr. Fasola’s appointment, Barry
Smith stepped down as a member of the Board and as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, effective as of
November 14, 2019. Following his appointment, at the direction of the Board, Mr. Fasola and the other members of the
Company’s senior management team initiated a comprehensive portfolio analysis of the Company’s businesses to
evaluate the value proposition offered by each business and the brand and growth potential of the Company in each
of the markets served by Magellan’s businesses.
In late February 2020, following the receipt of unsolicited proposals from a number of interested parties, the Board
authorized Magellan’s management team and a financial advisor engaged by the Company for this purpose to
commence a process to explore the potential for a sale of its MCC Business. In the Board’s view, a sale of the MCC
Business at an attractive price would eliminate the risks of execution of its profitability improvement initiatives
regarding the MCC Business, provide the Company with additional financial flexibility and allow the Company’s
senior management team to focus on the remaining businesses and improving the services provided to the customers
of those businesses. Pursuant to this process, a number of parties (a) entered into amendments to the confidentiality
agreements previously executed and delivered in connection with the Broad Outreach to extend the time periods
during which the standstill and non-solicitation and no-hire provisions contained therein would be in effect, (b) were
provided due diligence access and management presentations, (c) were provided with transaction documentation for
their review and comment and (d) were asked to submit proposals to purchase the MCC Business, as well as to
consider commercial agreements with Pharmacy Management and the Behavioral and Specialty Health businesses of
Healthcare. Following the conclusion of this process, on April 30, 2020, Magellan publicly announced that it had
entered into a definitive agreement with Molina to sell the MCC Business to Molina for a purchase price of $850
million, subject to certain adjustments (which we refer to as the “MCC Business Sale Announcement” and such sale,
the “MCC Business Sale”), as well as various binding letters of intent to enter into long-term commercial agreements,
including new medical pharmacy and
32
TABLE OF CONTENTS
musculoskeletal management services to be provided by Magellan to Molina members and Molina’s retaining
Magellan for behavioral health, pharmacy benefit management (which we refer to as “PBM”), radiology and
musculoskeletal management services in certain markets serviced by the MCC Business.
On May 15, 2020, following the MCC Business Sale Announcement, Mr. Neidorff contacted Mr. Fasola by phone and
indicated an interest in discussing the Company’s strategic plans following the completion of the MCC Business
Sale. Mr. Neidorff invited Mr. Fasola to meet in St. Louis, Missouri to continue this discussion. On May 19, 2020, in
anticipation of the in-person meeting in St. Louis, Centene requested that the parties enter into an amendment to the
Confidentiality Agreement and furnished a proposed draft of such an amendment to David Haddock, General
Counsel and Secretary of Magellan. The draft amendment served to extend the duration of the standstill provisions
applicable to Centene and the mutual non-solicitation and no-hire provisions and the overall term of the agreement.
The parties entered into the amendment prior to the in-person meeting, with effect as of May 19, 2020 (we refer to the
Confidentiality Agreement, as so amended, as the “Amended Confidentiality Agreement”).
Mr. Fasola informed Mr. Shulman of Mr. Neidorff’s outreach on their next regularly scheduled weekly call. From May
15, 2020 until the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021, in addition to updates provided to the
Board as described herein, Mr. Fasola kept Mr. Shulman updated regularly on the status and activities related to
Centene’s interest in a potential transaction, including any conversations and meetings that Mr. Fasola had with Mr.
Neidorff and other Centene representatives in which Mr. Shulman did not participate.
On May 21, 2020, Mr. Fasola, Mr. Neidorff and Jesse Hunter, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of
Centene, met in St. Louis. During this meeting, Mr. Neidorff informed Mr. Fasola of Centene’s renewed interest in
exploring a potential acquisition of Magellan and explained the strategic rationale for Centene’s interest. Mr. Neidorff
also commented that for regulatory and other reasons the closing of the MCC Business Sale would need to occur
prior to an acquisition of the Company by Centene and that he would expect that certain members of the Company’s
senior management team would continue in their positions with the Company following the transaction. Mr. Neidorff
also noted that Centene would not participate in any organized sale process that Magellan might pursue. Mr. Fasola
explained to Messrs. Neidorff and Hunter that while he would report Centene’s interest to his Board, in his view the
timing was not right for a transformative transaction involving the Company in the near term and that such a
transaction presented challenges for Magellan for several reasons, including Magellan’s unwillingness to take
actions that could in any way negatively impact or delay the pending MCC Business Sale, the Company’s focus on
and the dedication of management-team time to the implementation of the Medi-Cal pharmacy benefit administration
contract awarded to the Company by the state of California in late 2019 (which we refer to as the “Medi-Cal PBA
Agreement”) and the business-transformation initiatives that were underway and that were being carried out under
Mr. Fasola’s direction. Subsequent to this meeting, Mr. Hunter provided Magellan representatives with a list of
information and materials regarding Magellan that it wished to receive to facilitate its review of the desirability of a
transaction between the parties.
Following the May 21 meeting, Mr. Neidorff telephoned Mr. Shulman to express Centene’s interest in pursuing a
potential acquisition of the Company.
On June 8, 2020, Mr. Neidorff requested another meeting with Mr. Fasola, as well as Messrs. Shulman and Haddock,
to further discuss Centene’s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company, which meeting was
subsequently scheduled for June 18, 2020.
On June 9, 2020, representatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (which we refer to as “Skadden”),
counsel to Centene, and Weil spoke by telephone. In this conversation, the Skadden representatives stated that their
client’s strong preference was to explore the possibilities for a mutually beneficial transaction as promptly as possible
and, if mutually acceptable terms could be agreed to, envisioned the execution by the parties of a merger agreement
that would provide for Centene’s acquisition of Magellan conditioned, among other things, on the consummation of
the MCC Business Sale. The Skadden representatives and the Weil representative acknowledged that the terms of
the MCC Business Sale would need to be examined before it could be determined whether entry into such a merger
agreement during the pendency of the MCC Business Sale would be consistent with Magellan’s obligations under
the MCC Business Sale transaction documentation or could impact or delay the timing of the completion of such
transaction.
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 17, 2020, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, Messrs. Fasola and Shulman reported on their
conversations and meeting with Mr. Neidorff. The Board discussed Centene’s expression of interest and it was the
consensus of the Board that management’s primary focus should be on the completion of the MCC Business Sale
and the implementation of the Medi-Cal PBA Agreement and the other business initiatives that were underway, but
that Messrs. Fasola and Shulman should continue to agree to meet and discuss Centene’s interest with Mr. Neidorff
and the other Centene representatives and provide Centene with limited due diligence materials to determine if
Centene’s interest was serious and at an attractive price level.
On June 18, 2020, Messrs. Fasola, Shulman and Haddock traveled to St. Louis to meet with Messrs. Neidorff and
Hunter and representatives of Skadden. The Centene representatives reiterated their interest in exploring Centene’s
possible acquisition of Magellan in as expeditious a manner as possible consistent with Magellan’s obligations under
the transaction agreements for the MCC Business Sale. The Centene representatives also reiterated the strategic
rationale for such a transaction, including broadening and deepening Centene’s whole health capabilities and
establishing a leading behavioral health platform. The Magellan representatives reiterated their views as to why
attempting to effect a transaction such as the one envisioned by Centene in the near term was less than optimal from
Magellan’s perspective, but the meeting participants agreed that their respective legal counsel would discuss the
regulatory requirements and likely timing for the possible transaction as well as the potential impact of the execution
and delivery of a definitive merger agreement on the pending MCC Business Sale. The Magellan representatives also
agreed to provide Centene with certain non-public information regarding the Company to aid Centene’s efforts in
determining its interest in continuing to explore a potential transaction and arriving at a preliminary view on valuation
of the Company. On June 19, 2020, following the in-person meeting in St. Louis, Mr. Fasola instructed Jon Rubin, then
the Chief Financial Officer of Magellan, to share with Centene certain high-level non-public information concerning
Magellan and its prospects that had been previously requested by Centene.
On June 23, 2020, Mr. Fasola provided the Board with a written summary of the June 18 meeting in St. Louis and
noted his expectation that following delivery of certain information by Magellan, Centene would communicate, for the
Board’s review and consideration, a preliminary price or range of prices at which it would consider the acquisition of
the Company.
During the ensuing several weeks, representatives of Centene, with the assistance of Centene’s financial advisors,
Allen & Company LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, reviewed the limited non-public business and financial
information that was provided by the Company. During this period, representatives of the parties’ respective legal
advisors discussed the regulatory filings and consents that would be required in respect of an acquisition of
Magellan by Centene, the likely timing thereof and the potential impact on the regulatory filings and consents needed
to consummate the MCC Business Sale, as well as the potential impact of the execution of a definitive merger
agreement between the parties on the MCC Business Sale. During these conversations, Weil informed Skadden that
Magellan would not sign a definitive merger agreement with Centene prior to the consummation of the MCC
Business Sale. On July 10, 2020, representatives of Magellan provided representatives of Centene with certain
preliminary financial data.
On July 21, 2020, Messrs. Fasola and Rubin had a teleconference with Mr. Hunter and Jeff Schwaneke, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, to discuss certain questions of the Centene representatives
regarding the limited non-public information made available, including the Company’s preliminary financial data.
As part of the Company’s normal multi-year forecasting process, in Summer 2020, Magellan’s management developed
financial forecasts and unaudited prospective financial information relating to the Company for fiscal years through
2024, which included a small contingency to account for unspecified risks (which we refer to as the “Risk
Contingency”), consistent with management’s historical practice. Elements of this forecast were shared with the
Board at their regularly scheduled meeting on July 24, 2020. Later on July 24, 2020, Mr. Rubin provided certain
additional non-public information to representatives of Centene, including a five-year financial forecast (which
financial forecasts we refer to as the “July 2020 Forecasts” in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Certain
Forecasts”). The July 2020 Forecasts furnished to Centene were the same as those reviewed by the Board earlier in
the day, with the exception that the forecasts provided to Centene included two additional years and did not include
the Risk Contingency.

On August 9, 2020, Mr. Neidorff called Mr. Fasola and informed him that Centene intended to submit an indication of
interest regarding a potential acquisition of Magellan at $86.00 per share (which we refer to as the “preliminary
Centene proposal”). Mr. Fasola also understood Mr. Neidorff to say that the preliminary Centene proposal would
give Magellan stockholders dollar-for-dollar “credit” for the cash, net of transaction taxes and expenses and
Company indebtedness, resulting from the closing of the MCC Business Sale. Mr. Neidorff indicated that, if the price
was acceptable to the Board, Centene would expect a 30-day period of exclusivity to complete its due diligence
review and prepare and negotiate transaction documentation. Magellan estimated that the net cash proceeds from the
MCC Business Sale would represent approximately $12.00 per share, which, when added to the $86.00 per share price
indicated by Mr. Neidorff, resulted in Mr. Fasola’s understanding that the implied total value offered by the
preliminary Centene proposal was $98.00 per share. On the same day, Mr. Neidorff called Mr. Shulman and conveyed
what Mr. Shulman understood to be the same information regarding Centene’s indicated price and the additional
“credit” for the net cash from the MCC Business Sale. Also on August 9, 2020, at Mr. Fasola’s request, Mr. Rubin
called Mr. Hunter to confirm the Company’s understanding of the verbal preliminary proposal, and Mr. Rubin
understood Mr. Hunter to convey the same additional “credit” concept for the net cash from the MCC Business Sale.
On August 14, 2020, a meeting of the Board was held to discuss Centene’s verbal preliminary proposal, including the
implied total value of $98.00 per share, which represented a premium of approximately 29.2% above Magellan’s
closing price of $75.83 on August 13, 2020. It was the consensus of the Board that the indicated value to be delivered
to the Company’s stockholders was sufficiently attractive to warrant continued engagement with Centene and the
Board authorized the Company’s management to continue to conduct discussions and grant due diligence access to
Centene.
On August 16, 2020, Mr. Fasola emailed Mr. Neidorff to inform him that on the basis of the preliminary Centene
proposal, the Board was supportive of management’s continuing to explore a possible transaction with Centene.
In late August 2020, the Company contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities regarding
their availability to act as co-financial advisors to the Company in connection with a potential transaction with
Centene. Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities commenced acting as co-financial advisors to the Company in
connection with the potential transaction shortly thereafter and Magellan formally confirmed the engagement of
these firms in separate agreements dated October 27, 2020. Prior to their respective engagements, each financial
advisor delivered to Magellan an executed disclosure letter regarding its relationships with Centene. For a summary
of these relationships, see the sections entitled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” and “-Opinion of
Guggenheim Securities, LLC,” beginning on pages 49 and 56, respectively.
During late August and early-to-mid September 2020, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hunter, together with representatives of the
Company’s and Centene’s respective advisors, held telephone calls and exchanged correspondence regarding the
proposed timeline for Centene to conduct its due diligence review, formally present to Magellan a proposal regarding
price and the timeline to complete transaction documentation should the parties agree on price and other terms.
During these discussions, Mr. Rubin and the Company’s financial advisors reiterated that Magellan would not enter
into a definitive merger agreement prior to the closing of the MCC Business Sale.
On October 1, 2020, Mr. Fasola provided the Board with a written update on the status of the Company’s engagement
with Centene and the due diligence process, noting that Centene had identified certain due diligence priorities as a
precondition to confirming its interest and views on price. Mr. Fasola stated that the Company was working with its
legal and financial advisors to evaluate each request and indicated that, notwithstanding Centene’s position, the
Company would not provide certain competitively sensitive information prior to receipt of a satisfactory preliminary
written proposal with respect to price.
In early-to-mid October, members of management of Magellan and Centene, at times together with representatives of
the Company’s and Centene’s respective advisors, held telephonic conferences at which the Magellan
representatives provided the Centene representatives with presentations regarding the Company’s Behavioral
Health, Pharmacy Management and Specialty Health businesses. On October 12, 2020, Mr. Fasola met with Messrs.
Neidorff and Hunter in St. Louis to discuss the Company’s Behavioral Health business strategy.
On October 23, 2020, Mr. Neidorff called Mr. Fasola and stated that the Company would receive a written offer from
Centene of $86.00 per share prior to the Company’s Board meeting scheduled to take place on October 27, 2020. No
other terms of Centene’s offer were disclosed or discussed on this call. Mr. Fasola subsequently
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
informed Mr. Shulman and the Company’s advisors of the anticipated written offer. On October 26, 2020, Centene sent
a letter addressed to Mr. Shulman setting forth preliminary, non-binding terms for Centene’s acquisition of Magellan.
The October 26 letter (which we refer to as the “October 26 proposal”) confirmed Centene’s previously communicated
price of $86.00 per share, comprised of $64.50 per share in cash and a fixed ratio of Centene stock. On October 23,
2020, the last trading day prior to the Company’s receipt of Centene’s letter, the closing price of Magellan common
stock was $78.50. The October 26 proposal implied a pro forma ownership for Magellan stockholders in Centene of
approximately 1.5%. In addition, the October 26 proposal indicated, among other things, that (1) Centene believed
that it could obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction expeditiously, (2) the transaction would not be subject to
any financing condition, (3) Centene is committed to building a differentiated specialty solutions business and
looked forward to discussing leadership opportunities with the Magellan team, (4) Centene’s offer assumed a 30-day
period of exclusivity to complete due diligence and negotiate definition documentation, (5) Centene would need to
conduct additional due diligence prior to executing a definitive transaction agreement and (6) Centene would share a
draft of the merger agreement for the transaction promptly after Magellan’s entry into the exclusivity agreement.
Centene then sent representatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities a draft exclusivity agreement (which
we refer to as the “Exclusivity Agreement”).
Following receipt of the October 26 proposal and consultation with Mr. Shulman and the Company’s advisors on
October 26, Mr. Fasola telephoned Mr. Neidorff to clarify the financial terms of the October 26 proposal, which varied
from Mr. Fasola’s understanding of the oral indication conveyed by Mr. Neidorff on August 9, 2020, in that it did not
give Magellan stockholders the additional “credit” for the net cash resulting from the closing of the MCC Business
Sale. Mr. Neidorff stated that Centene’s $86.00 per share indication of interest accounted for the net cash resulting
from the MCC Business Sale and that the preliminary Centene proposal did not contemplate giving “credit” of such
amount to Magellan stockholders. Mr. Fasola informed Mr. Neidorff that given this position, it was his view that the
October 26 proposal would not be viewed as attractive by the Board.
On October 27, 2020, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, which was attended by certain members of
Magellan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil. Mr. Fasola and Mr.
Shulman presented the terms of the October 26 proposal to the Board. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Guggenheim Securities then delivered a presentation to the Board regarding general market and industry conditions
and their respective preliminary financial analyses of the Company and the October 26 proposal. In connection with
the Board’s consideration of the potential transaction, financial forecasts through 2024 that were consistent with the
financial forecasts that had been reviewed with the Board on July 24, 2020, were presented to the Board (which
financial forecasts we refer to as the “October 2020 Forecasts” in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-
Certain Forecasts”). The Board discussed with members of Magellan’s management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Guggenheim Securities certain strategic alternatives available to the Company, including continuing as a
standalone company and deployment of the net cash from the closing of the MCC Business Sale. Representatives of
Weil reviewed certain terms and legal aspects of the October 26 proposal and discussed with the Board various legal
matters, including the directors’ fiduciary duties in considering the October 26 proposal and process considerations,
including Centene’s request for exclusivity. Following the advisors’ presentations and discussion, the Board
determined that the October 26 proposal was not attractive but that the parties should continue their dialogue to
determine if Centene’s offer could be improved. After discussion, the Board also was of the view that the Company
would not consider granting a period of exclusivity unless Mr. Neidorff indicated a higher price. In addition, the
Board determined that it would be premature for any member of management to have discussions with Centene
concerning possible post-transaction employment. The Board directed Messrs. Fasola and Shulman to respond to
Centene accordingly.
Later on October 27, 2020, Mr. Fasola spoke to Mr. Neidorff by telephone, during which Mr. Fasola reminded Mr.
Neidorff of his understanding of the basis on which Magellan had agreed to provide Centene with access to
preliminary non-public due diligence information, namely that Centene’s proposal as to price would reflect a full
market premium to Magellan’s then-current market price and permit Magellan stockholders to receive the additional
“credit” for the net cash proceeds, after debt, from the MCC Business Sale and noted that the financial terms of the
October 26 proposal were inconsistent with this understanding. Further, Mr. Fasola informed Mr. Neidorff that the
Board had expressed concerns regarding the risks to Magellan and the initiatives and business transformation that
were underway that could result from advancing discussions and distracting
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
management if discussions with Centene were unlikely to result in a price viewed as compelling by the Board. Mr.
Fasola informed Mr. Neidorff that the Board did not view the October 26 proposal as attractive. Mr. Neidorff asked
Mr. Fasola to offer a counter-proposal, but Mr. Fasola did not offer a counter-proposal on the call.
On October 29, 2020, Mr. Fasola and Mr. Hunter spoke by telephone. Mr. Fasola said that he and Mr. Shulman had
reflected on Mr. Neidorff’s request for a counter-proposal and, while he was not prepared to mention a specific price,
he informed Mr. Hunter that the sentiment of the Board was to view favorably an all-cash price of greater than $100.00
per share. Mr. Fasola told Mr. Hunter that, if Centene submitted a revised proposal meeting this criteria, he believed
that the Board would view the proposal as attractive and grant Centene a brief period of exclusivity.
On October 30, 2020, Mr. Neidorff held a conference call with Messrs. Fasola and Shulman. During the call, Mr.
Neidorff said that Magellan’s price indication as conveyed to Mr. Hunter was well in excess of premia paid in relevant
precedent transactions. Mr. Neidorff told the Magellan representatives that Centene was increasing its proposal to
$91.00 per share and said that such a price represented a 28% premium over Magellan’s “net equity”, meaning
Magellan’s closing per share price on October 30, 2020 less the net cash per share that would result from the MCC
Business Sale. Mr. Neidorff noted that his proposal contemplated that the merger consideration would be comprised
of a mix of cash and stock as previously communicated and that the cash proceeds of the MCC Business Sale would
remain in the Company at the time of the acquisition by Centene.
The next day Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Shulman had a number of calls during which they discussed Centene’s latest
proposal. Mr. Shulman told Mr. Neidorff that be believed that applying the premia paid in the precedent transactions
referenced by Mr. Neidorff and the “net equity” premium calculation cited by Mr. Neidorff would result in a price per
share greater than $91.00. Mr. Shulman also told Mr. Neidorff that he did not believe that the $91.00 per share
proposal would gain the support of the Board. Mr. Neidorff indicated that, if Mr. Shulman believed his latest proposal
was not sufficiently attractive, then he should put forth a counter-proposal.
On November 1, 2020, following a discussion of Centene’s $91.00 per share proposal with the Company’s advisors,
Messrs. Fasola and Shulman called Mr. Neidorff and proposed a per share price of $100.00 in cash. Mr. Neidorff told
Messrs. Fasola and Shulman that in his view this price was a restatement of the lower end of the prior “range”
proposed by Magellan and not a counter-proposal, in response to which Mr. Shulman made a revised counter-
proposal of $99.00 per share in cash.
Telephonic conference calls among Messrs. Neidorff, Fasola and Shulman ensued throughout the day on November
1, 2020. Following Magellan’s counter-proposal, Mr. Neidorff informed Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman that Centene
would increase its offer to $94.00 per share. Mr. Shulman responded that he continued to believe that the premium
represented by Centene’s increased price remained inconsistent with the premia for the precedent transactions and
the “net equity” premium calculation previously cited by Mr. Neidorff and that he would consult with his financial
advisors to confirm the accuracy of this view. Shortly thereafter, after consulting with the Company’s financial
advisors, Messrs. Fasola and Shulman resumed discussions with Mr. Neidorff, during which Mr. Neidorff informed
Messrs. Fasola and Shulman that Centene’s best and final offer was $95.00 per share in cash (which we refer to as the
“November 1 proposal”). The November 1 proposal represented a premium of 31.5% to the closing share price of
$72.27 on October 30, 2020 and a 26.2% premium over the volume-weighted average Magellan stock price for the 30
full consecutive trading days ending on such date. Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman noted that they would present the
November 1 proposal to the Board for consideration.
In the evening of November 1, 2020, a meeting of the Board was convened, with members of management of Magellan
and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil in attendance, to review the status of
discussions with Centene. Messrs. Fasola and Shulman reported on their telephone calls with Mr. Neidorff and
described the process that resulted in Centene’s November 1 proposal. The Company’s financial advisors then
presented preliminary financial analyses based on the October 2020 Forecasts and related to a potential transaction.
The Board discussed the financial merits of the November 1 proposal and determined that the November 1 proposal
was attractive in light of, among other things, the execution risks associated with the initiatives and business
transformation contemplated by the Company’s business plan and potential uncertainties relating to developments in
the healthcare industry. In connection with Centene’s request for a 30-day period of exclusivity, the Board considered
a number of relevant considerations, including the scope of the Broad Outreach, which included contact with
potential strategic acquirors, and the results of that process, the
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
management distraction, leak and other risks associated with contacting third parties, including the possibility of
losing the opportunity to engage in a transaction with Centene given Mr. Neidorff’s stated view that Centene would
be unwilling to participate in any process by Magellan to explore alternative transactions, the Board’s belief,
following consultation with its financial advisors, that it was highly unlikely that any third party would be interested
in acquiring Magellan at a price equal to or in excess of the November 1 proposal and the fact that Magellan would
have the ability to consider unsolicited proposals following the execution and announcement of a merger agreement
with Centene. In light of the foregoing, the Board directed Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman to inform Centene that based
on the terms of the November 1 proposal, the Company would be willing to enter into the requested period of
exclusivity with Centene and proceed to negotiate the terms of a merger agreement and conclude the due diligence
process.
Following the Board meeting, Mr. Shulman telephoned Mr. Neidorff to report on the Board’s determination. Mr.
Neidorff subsequently called Mr. Fasola to continue discussions regarding the potential transaction.
On November 2, 2020, representatives of Weil sent representatives of Skadden a revised draft Exclusivity Agreement
providing for an initial exclusivity period of 14 days and an additional 14-day extension of exclusivity if, prior to the
expiration of the initial 14-day period, Centene confirmed in writing the substantial completion of its due diligence
review and that Centene continued to support a potential transaction at a per share price equal to or greater than
$95.00. The revised draft also provided that exclusivity would terminate at such time as any representative of Centene
indicated to any representative of the Company that Centene is no longer pursuing or interested in an acquisition of
the Company at a per share price equal to or greater than $95.00 and deleted the requirement that the Company notify
Centene of any inquiry, proposal or offer that the Company might receive with respect to an alternative transaction.
Later that day, representatives of Weil and Skadden had a teleconference regarding, among other matters, the term of
the exclusivity period, which Skadden stated was unacceptable to Centene.
Also on November 2, 2020, Mr. Hunter called Mr. Fasola to confirm receipt of Magellan’s comments to the Exclusivity
Agreement and said that Skadden would be sending Weil a revised draft reflecting a 30-day exclusivity period. Mr.
Hunter also alerted Mr. Fasola to the fact that Centene would be sending a list of confirmatory due diligence requests
within 48 hours.
On November 3, 2020, the parties executed the Exclusivity Agreement, which provided for a 30-day exclusivity period
that would be automatically extended unless terminated by either party upon one business days’ notice, provided
that the Exclusivity Agreement would be earlier terminated upon entry by the parties into a definitive transaction
agreement or at such time as any Centene representative indicated to any Company representative that Centene is no
longer pursuing or interested in an acquisition of the Company at a per share price equal to or greater than $95.00.
Following execution of the Exclusivity Agreement, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities
engaged in discussions with Centene’s financial advisors regarding the next stage of the process and related matters.
On November 5, 2020, representatives of Weil sent representatives of Skadden a draft clean room agreement (which
we refer to as the “Clean Room Agreement”) to govern the exchange of, and implement procedures to protect, certain
competitively sensitive information of the Company. From November 5, 2020 through November 7, 2020, Skadden and
Weil exchanged multiple drafts of the Clean Room Agreement, which was executed with effect as of November 7,
2020.
On November 12, 2020, Magellan provided Centene and its advisors with access to an electronic data room, including
a designated “clean room” pursuant to the Clean Room Agreement, containing certain non-public information
regarding the Company.
Throughout the remainder of November and until the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021,
representatives of Centene engaged in a due diligence review of the Company. In connection with Centene’s due
diligence review, representatives of the Company, including members of the Company’s senior management, and
representatives of the Company’s financial and/or legal advisors, as applicable, participated in multiple due diligence
and follow-up diligence calls with representatives of Centene during this period.
Also on November 12, 2020, due to Centene’s belief that there had been delays in its receipt of certain requested due
diligence information, representatives of Skadden sent representatives of Weil a draft amendment to the
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Exclusivity Agreement, which amendment proposed to extend the initial term of the exclusivity period until December
31, 2020. The other terms of exclusivity, including automatic extension unless terminated by either party upon one
business days’ notice, remained unchanged.
On November 17, 2020, Mr. Fasola reported to Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Hunter that, on November 13, 2020, the California
Department of Health Care Services (which we refer to as “DHCS”) informed Magellan that DHCS intended to delay
the implementation of the Medi-Cal PBA Agreement from January 1, 2021 to April 1, 2021 in order to better leverage
Magellan’s workforce to bring to fruition certain aspects of the Medi-Cal PBA Agreement and to utilize such
additional time to conduct enhanced outreach and education, which delay was announced publicly by DHCS on
November 16, 2020. Mr. Fasola noted in this communication that DHCS had reiterated its commitment to the
relationship with Magellan.
On November 18, 2020, Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Shulman spoke by telephone to discuss the terms of the exclusivity
arrangement between the parties. On this call, Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Shulman agreed to the extension of exclusivity in
additional one-week increments. In the evening of November 18, 2020, representatives of Skadden sent to
representatives of Weil a revised draft amendment to the Exclusivity Agreement, pursuant to which termination of
exclusivity would require seven business days’ notice from either party following the initial 30-day period. On
November 19, 2020, the parties executed the amendment to the Exclusivity Agreement.
On November 20, 2020, Mr. Fasola met in-person with Mr. Neidorff and Sarah London, Senior Vice President,
Technology Innovation & Modernization of Centene, in Addison, Texas. In connection with Centene’s anticipated
expansion of payor services following consummation of the potential acquisition, Ms. London addressed a number
of matters with Mr. Fasola, including innovation and required technology, IT leadership, employee retention risk and
areas of perceived business gaps and capital deployment to advance the strategy related to recent and pending
investments.
On November 23, 2020, Skadden sent an initial draft of the Merger Agreement for the proposed transaction to Weil.
From November 23, 2020 until the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021, the parties and their
respective legal advisors exchanged numerous drafts, and engaged in numerous discussions and negotiations
concerning the terms, of the Merger Agreement and certain ancillary documentation. During the course of these
negotiations, significant areas of discussion and negotiation involved (1) Centene’s level of commitment to obtain
regulatory approvals and Centene’s ability to control the related approval process and strategy, (2) the outside date
after which either party could elect to terminate the Merger Agreement if the transaction had not been completed
prior to such date, (3) the magnitude of the termination fee payable to Centene and the circumstances under which
such fee would be payable, (4) the treatment of outstanding equity awards in connection with the transaction, (5) the
obligations of the Company in connection with assisting Centene’s efforts regarding the financing for the transaction
and possible refinancing of its indebtedness and the impact thereof on the timing of the transaction, (6) the scope of
the representations, warranties and covenants, including the “no shop” provisions and the interim operating
restrictions on the Company, (7) the Company’s ability to take certain actions with respect to employee compensation
and benefits during the interim period and Centene’s commitments to continuing employees of Magellan for a limited
period of time following the transaction and (8) the definition of “material adverse effect”.
On December 8, 2020, Mr. Haddock, another representative of Magellan and Christopher Koster, Senior Vice
President, Secretary and General Counsel of Centene, as well as representatives of Weil and Skadden, participated in
a teleconference regarding the scope, process and anticipated timing of certain state regulatory filings required in
connection with the proposed transaction.
Also on December 8, 2020, and regularly thereafter until the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021,
Mr. Fasola and Mr. Hunter spoke by telephone regarding the progress of Centene’s diligence efforts, areas of
remaining review and any perceived impediments to progressing the potential transaction. Such conversations
typically addressed next steps for the respective parties.
Lastly, on December 8, 2020, representatives of Skadden sent to representatives of Weil a draft Merger Support
Agreement proposed to be entered into by the Starboard Parties in connection with the proposed transaction in
respect of, among other things, the voting of the Starboard Parties’ shares of Magellan common stock in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement. On December 23, 2020, Magellan provided the draft Merger Support Agreement
to Starboard.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 9, 2020, Mr. Fasola provided Mr. Shulman, members of Magellan management and the Company’s legal
and financial advisors with a written update regarding the anticipated timing of the closing of the MCC Business
Sale. Mr. Fasola reported that the consummation of the MCC Business Sale would occur on December 31, 2020. On
the same day, Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman updated Mr. Hunter and Mr. Neidorff, respectively, regarding the expected
closing date for the MCC Business Sale.
On December 10, 2020, the Board, with members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil in attendance, held a meeting to discuss the potential transaction with
Centene. Mr. Fasola first apprised the Board of the anticipated December 31, 2020 closing date for the MCC Business
Sale and, consequently, the targeted announcement of a proposed execution of the Merger Agreement with Centene
during the first week of January 2021. Mr. Fasola, together with the representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Guggenheim Securities, provided an update on the status of negotiations, including ongoing conversations
regarding regulatory approvals and the continued engagement and in-depth nature of Centene’s diligence review.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities reviewed with the Board market conditions, the
performance of Magellan’s share price since November 1, 2020, the date the Board authorized the execution of the
Exclusivity Agreement based upon the November 1 proposal, and the implied premia of the November 1 proposal of
$95.00 per share to current trading and selected volume-weighted average prices of the Magellan stock. Based on the
closing share price of $79.81 on December 9, 2020, the November 1 proposal represented a 19% premium to the
current Magellan stock price and a 19.8% premium over the volume-weighted average Magellan stock price for the 30
full consecutive trading days ending on December 9, 2020. The Board engaged in a discussion concerning the
transaction price, concluding that Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman should address the topic of a per share price increase
with Centene when Centene was closer to completion of due diligence. Weil then provided the Board with an
overview of the status of certain key terms under discussion in connection with the Merger Agreement, including the
efforts that Centene would be required to use to obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction, the definition of
“material adverse effect”, the “marketing period” for Centene’s transaction financing, the ability to extend the outside
date to close the transaction in connection with regulatory approvals, and the fees payable to Centene, and the size
thereof, upon certain terminations of the Merger Agreement. Following these discussions, the Board determined that
the Company should continue to pursue a potential transaction with Centene to determine whether a transaction
could be finalized on acceptable terms.
During the period from December 10, 2020 to December 22, 2020, Magellan and Centene, together with their
respective advisors, continued to progress the work necessary to reach agreement on and to enter into definitive
transaction documentation, including targeted diligence calls and preparation of revised Merger Agreement drafts,
and discussions regarding certain provisions of the Merger Agreement.
On December 22, 2020, representatives of Weil and Skadden held a telephone call during which Skadden informed
Weil that it was important to Centene that certain Magellan executives, including Mr. Fasola, enter into employment
letter agreements with Centene in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement.
On December 23, 2020, Mr. Fasola called each of Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Hunter to request an increased transaction
price, noting that Magellan’s share price had increased during the period of due diligence and negotiation of
definitive transactions agreements. Mr. Fasola emphasized that the Board was expecting an increase in the per share
transaction price to reflect such share price increase. Mr. Neidorff responded that such conversations were premature
and that Centene and Magellan should discuss any change in price the following week.
On December 24, 2020, Mr. Shulman called Mr. Neidorff to reiterate the reasons conveyed by Mr. Fasola for an
increase in the transaction price, as well as the expectation of the Board that Centene would agree to such an
increase.
Also on December 24, 2020, Mr. Fasola provided a written update to the Board regarding the status of the potential
transaction. In his update, Mr. Fasola noted that Centene had asked Magellan to set a target date of January 4, 2021
to announce the execution of a definitive agreement by the parties and that he and Mr. Shulman would continue
negotiations with Centene regarding a higher transaction price in order to present a revised offer to the Board for
consideration at the Board meeting scheduled for December 30, 2020. Mr. Fasola also outlined areas of risk or
underperformance that Centene had identified as reasons that an increased price proposal might not be warranted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 26, 2020, representatives of Weil sent representatives of Skadden a draft of the Company’s disclosure
schedule to the Merger Agreement. From December 26, 2020 through the execution of the Merger Agreement on
January 4, 2021, Weil and Skadden exchanged multiple drafts of, and participated in several discussions regarding,
the Company’s disclosure schedule and various exhibits to the Merger Agreement.
On December 29, 2020, Mr. Fasola, Mr. Hunter and Colin Toney, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Group Strategy of
Centene, spoke regarding the status of Centene’s due diligence review and remaining areas of inquiry. During this
conversation, Mr. Hunter asked Mr. Fasola whether points of information remained outstanding from Centene in
advance of Magellan’s Board meeting scheduled for December 30, 2020. Mr. Fasola stated again that Magellan had
requested, and was waiting for a response regarding, an increased offer price to reflect the recent increase in the
trading prices of the Magellan stock, which the Board would be focused on at the meeting.
On December 30, 2020, the Board held a meeting with members of management of Magellan and representatives of
Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil in attendance. Mr. Fasola reported to the Board on his
conversations with Mr. Neidorff and Mr. Hunter regarding the request for a revised proposal reflecting an increased
transaction price. Mr. Fasola informed the directors that Centene had not submitted a revised proposal in response to
such request. Mr. Fasola then shared an update regarding Centene’s due diligence efforts and noted a limited number
of outstanding high priority items. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities next reviewed with
the Board their respective updated preliminary financial analyses related to a transaction with Centene. Goldman
Sachs and Guggenheim Securities also discussed with the Board the likelihood of any potential alternative
counterparties interested in acquiring Magellan at a per share price in excess of $95.00. Weil then provided the Board
with a review of the Board’s fiduciary duties and discussed certain key terms that were under discussion, including,
among certain others, the size of the termination fee, the events that would trigger the requirement for the Company
to pay the termination fee, Centene’s request to receive reimbursement of its expenses upon a “no vote” by the
Magellan stockholders and proposed restrictions on Centene’s acquisition activity prior to consummation of the
transaction. In addition, Weil advised the Board that Centene had expressed a desire to negotiate offers of
employment with certain Magellan executives, but that to date no Magellan executives had been authorized to
discuss future employment opportunities or terms with Centene. The Board, upon consideration and discussion of
the information presented and reviewed, authorized and requested Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman to continue to engage
in negotiations with Mr. Neidorff regarding transaction price. The Board also advised that it would not authorize any
members of management to engage in discussions with Centene regarding employment until an agreement on the
transaction price and other material terms for the transaction had been finalized.
On the morning of December 31, 2020, the MCC Business Sale was consummated. A representative of Weil advised a
representative of Skadden of this development later that day.
Throughout the day on December 31, 2020, Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman had several discussions with Mr. Neidorff
regarding transaction price. Mr. Neidorff informed Messrs. Fasola and Shulman that Centene would not increase its
$95.00 per share proposal and that, to the contrary, Centene had been considering decreasing its offer price. In the
afternoon on December 31, 2020, following the discussions with Mr. Neidorff, Mr. Fasola convened an unscheduled
teleconference with several available Board members to provide an update on the discussions regarding transaction
price.
Also in the afternoon on December 31, 2020, Mr. Fasola spoke with Mr. Hunter to discuss his earlier conversations
with Mr. Neidorff, including Mr. Neidorff’s suggestion that Centene was considering a proposal to decrease the
transaction price. Mr. Hunter called Mr. Fasola subsequently and reconfirmed Centene’s interest in a proposed
acquisition of Magellan at a transaction price of $95.00 per share. However, Mr. Hunter requested a prompt response
from Magellan confirming its intention to continue pursuing a proposed transaction with Centene at such price in
order to complete all open items in time for a January 4, 2021 announcement.
In the evening on January 1, 2021, a meeting of the Board was held, with members of management of Magellan and
representatives of Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Weil in attendance, to provide an update regarding
the proposed transaction. Mr. Fasola reported to the Board that Centene had reaffirmed its best and final offer of
$95.00 per share in cash, as set forth in the November 1 proposal. At the request of members of the Board, Mr. Fasola
also provided his view on Magellan’s outlook in the near- and longer-term. The Board and representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities engaged in a discussion of the longer-term strategies and near-term risks
that might negatively impact Magellan’s stock price. The Board reached consensus
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and unanimously authorized Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman to continue to finalize the documentation of a transaction
based on Centene’s offer of $95.00 per share. The Board further directed Messrs. Fasola and Shulman, in connection
with affirming the Board’s approval of the $95.00 offer price, to seek to obtain Centene’s agreement with respect to
the open items in the Merger Agreement relating to (1) the reduction in the size of the termination fee that could be
due and owing to Centene under certain circumstances, (2) the deletion of a “no vote” expense reimbursement
provision in the event the Magellan stockholders fail to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (3)
inclusion of a “clear markets provision” prohibiting Centene from entering into strategic transactions that would
reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the proposed transaction by the outside date.
In the morning on January 2, 2021, Mr. Fasola detailed in an email to Mr. Hunter the terms endorsed by the Board. Mr.
Shulman also contacted Mr. Neidorff regarding these terms. Messrs. Neidorff and Shulman subsequently agreed to a
termination fee in an amount equal to $76,530,000, or approximately 3% of the equity value of Magellan based on the
offer price of $95.00 per share and the exclusion of the “no vote” expense reimbursement provision and inclusion of
the “clear markets provision” sought by Magellan.
On January 2, 2021, representatives of Skadden sent representatives of Weil a draft employment letter agreement for
Mr. Fasola (which we refer to as the “Fasola Letter Agreement”), to be effective upon the consummation of the
potential transaction. Weil forwarded the Fasola Letter Agreement draft to Mr. Fasola and his counsel and during the
period from January 2, 2021 to January 4, 2021, Mr. Fasola and his counsel exchanged drafts of, and participated in
discussions regarding, the Fasola Letter Agreement with representatives of Centene, including Mr. Neidorff, and
Skadden.
Also on January 2, 2021, on behalf of the Starboard Parties and their counsel, representatives of Weil shared with
representatives of Skadden comments to the draft Merger Support Agreement. From January 2, 2021 through the
execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021, Skadden and counsel to the Starboard Parties exchanged
drafts of the Merger Support Agreement.
During the period from January 2, 2021 through the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 4, 2021,
representatives of Magellan and Centene and their respective legal counsel, Weil and Skadden, continued to work to
finalize the definitive documentation for the potential transaction.
In the evening on January 3, 2021, a meeting of the Board was held for the purpose of consideration of the approval
and adoption of the Merger Agreement with Centene. Representatives of Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and
Weil, as well as members of management of Magellan, were in attendance. Mr. Fasola and Mr. Shulman provided the
Board with an update on discussions with Centene and the resolutions of the open issues in the Merger Agreement.
At the meeting, Mr. Shulman and Mr. Fasola reviewed with the Board the status of the Fasola Letter Agreement as
presented by Centene and reported on certain modifications that were being sought by Mr. Fasola, which remained
open items in the negotiations. The Board discussed with Messrs. Shulman and Fasola these outstanding items and
Centene’s position that the terms of Mr. Fasola’s Letter Agreement needed to be finalized and agreed to prior to
Centene’s execution of definitive agreements for the potential transaction. The Board discussed alternatives to
proceeding with the transaction with Centene, including strategic plans for capital deployment if Magellan remained
an independent company on a standalone basis. The Board then considered and expressed their views regarding the
advantages of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Goldman Sachs presented to the Board a financial
analysis with respect to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then rendered to the Board an
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated as of January 4, 2021, to the effect that, as of the date
of its written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its written opinion, the
$95.00 per share of Magellan common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of
outstanding shares of Magellan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities then presented to the Board a financial analysis
with respect to the proposed transaction. A representative of Guggenheim Securities then rendered an oral opinion,
which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the Board to the effect that, as of January 4, 2021 and based
upon and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations
of and qualifications to the review undertaken, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of shares of Magellan common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
During the meeting, the Board was informed that the financial forecasts provided to Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim
Securities and approved by Magellan management for use in their financial analyses had been revised by
management from those last provided to Centene and previously discussed with the Board to take into account the
delay in implementation of the Medi-Cal PBA Agreement, significant scope reduction of an additional PBM contract
and the non-renewal of another PBM contract (which financial forecasts we refer to as the “January 2021 Forecasts”
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Certain Forecasts”), each of which had been disclosed to and
discussed with Centene during its due diligence review. Following discussion, the Board unanimously approved and
declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
its stockholders, directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption
and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger Agreement. During the meeting,
the Board also voted to adopt an amendment to the Company’s bylaws to provide that the Court of Chancery in the
State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for the adjudication of certain disputes involving Magellan and federal
district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the adjudication of litigation arising
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
In the early morning on January 4, 2021, each of Magellan, Centene and Merger Sub executed and delivered the
Merger Agreement and Centene and the Starboard Parties executed and delivered the Merger Support Agreement.
Magellan and Centene issued a joint press release announcing the proposed transaction and entry into the Merger
Agreement.

Magellan’s management and its legal and financial advisors, the Board unanimously:

approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated thereby;

At a meeting held on January 3, 2021, the Board unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Board
unanimously recommends that the Magellan stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
In arriving at this determination and recommendation, the Board reviewed and discussed a significant amount of
information and consulted with Magellan’s management, legal counsel and financial advisors. The following are some
of the significant factors that were considered by the Board and supported its decision to approve the Merger
Agreement and recommend that the Magellan stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement (not necessarily in order of
relative importance):
Merger Consideration. The Board considered that the Merger Consideration represented:
•
a 14.7% premium over the per share closing price of Magellan’s common stock on December 31, 2020, the
last trading day prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “12/31 closing
price”); a 24.8% premium over what the Board considered to be the Company’s per share “net equity” on
December 31, 2020, (i.e., the 12/31 closing price net of the estimated per share after-tax cash proceeds
received in the MCC Business Sale), calculated by deducting from both the Merger Consideration and the
12/31 closing price the estimated per share after-tax cash proceeds received in the MCC Business Sale; and
an 18.3% premium over the Company’s volume-weighted average share price for the 30 full consecutive
trading days prior to the date of the Merger Agreement;
43TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the best and final offer of Centene, in the view of the Board and Magellan’s financial advisors, and the
highest consideration payable to Magellan stockholders that was reasonably obtainable; and
•
a price per share that, in the Board’s view, was unlikely to be achieved on a standalone basis in the near
future.
Prospects of Magellan.
•
the Board considered the possibility of continuing to operate Magellan as an independent entity and the
desirability and perceived risks of continuing to execute on its business plan, the potential benefits to
Magellan stockholders of this alternative and the time horizon required for the business plan to yield
improved financial and market performance by the Company;
•
the Board considered Magellan’s standalone business plan, financial forecasts and the risks associated
with Magellan’s ability to execute on and achieve such business plan and forecasts, including execution
risks associated with implementing planned-on initiatives across new partnerships and product
introductions, sales efforts and business transformations;
•
the Board considered the significant financial investments that would be required to execute on its
business plan, including the timing thereof;
•
the Board considered certain industry trends and the potential risks and volatility associated with these
developments, including larger pharmacy management companies increasing competition in the middle
market, rebate and other regulatory developments leading to margin erosion and insourcing risk,
particularly in the behavioral health market; and
•
the Board also considered the fact that certain investments in and acquisitions of unaffiliated third parties
were contemplated as part of the business plan and in that regard considered the potential of limited
opportunities on financially attractive terms.
Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value. The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is a fixed cash
amount providing Magellan stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the closing of the
Merger, in comparison to the risks and uncertainty that would be inherent in remaining a standalone company or
pursuing a transaction in which all or a portion of the consideration would be payable in stock.
Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The Board considered the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in a
written opinion dated as of January 4, 2021, to the effect that, as of the date of its written opinion, and based upon
and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its written opinion, the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan
common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of the shares of Magellan common
stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully
described in the section entitled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” beginning on page 49 and Annex C to this
proxy statement.
Opinion of Guggenheim Securities. The Board considered the financial presentation and the opinion, dated as of
January 4, 2021, of Guggenheim Securities to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the
date of the opinion, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of shares of Magellan common stock, which opinion
was based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various
limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken as more fully described under the section entitled “-Opinion
of Guggenheim Securities, LLC” beginning on page 56 and Annex D to this proxy statement.
2019 Sales Process: The Board considered the Broad Outreach and related lengthy and broad sales process
conducted by the Company that concluded in the fall of 2019 that resulted in only one potentially interested party
indicating an interest in acquiring all of the Company, with such indication being at a per share price that was
substantially below the Merger Consideration, and which process terminated due to the Company’s inability to reach
satisfactory terms with any potential counterparty. For additional details, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “-Background of the Merger.”
Negotiations with Centene and the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the general terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement (which are described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement”), including:
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger, including the fact that Centene’s and Merger Sub’s
obligations to complete the Merger are not conditioned upon the receipt of financing;
•
the significant commitment by Centene to obtain the HSR Act Clearance and the required consents and the
belief of the Board that the transaction does not present significant apparent regulatory concerns that
would impact the ability of the parties to complete the Merger;
•
the belief of the Board that the outside date (as it may be extended under the Merger Agreement) provides
the parties with sufficient time to obtain the HSR Act Clearance and the required consents;
•
Magellan’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information and conduct negotiations with third
parties regarding unsolicited alternative acquisitions proposals, including that, although standstill
restrictions under six confidentiality agreements entered into or amended in connection with the Broad
Outreach and/or the exploration of the MCC Business Sale remained in effect in accordance with their terms
following the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, five of which standstill restrictions
prohibited the making of confidential proposals to the Board, Magellan would be permitted to waive such
standstill restrictions in certain circumstances to the extent necessary to permit the counterparty to make a
confidential alternative acquisition proposal to the Board;
•
Magellan’s ability, under certain circumstances, to change its recommendation that stockholders adopt the
Merger Agreement in the event that the Company receives a superior proposal or certain other intervening
events occur;
•
Magellan’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, subject to
Centene’s ability to negotiate to match such superior proposal and subject to paying a termination fee of
$76,530,000;
•
the fact that the Board believed that the termination fee of $76,530,000 is reasonable (in part because of the
Board’s belief that the amount of such termination fee is generally consistent with the amount of
termination fees in comparable transactions) and not preclusive of other offers;
•
Magellan’s general entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement;
•
that the Merger Agreement is subject to the adoption by Magellan stockholders, which, in the Board’s
view, would allow sufficient time for a third party to make a superior proposal to acquire Magellan if it
desires to do so;
•
that the Merger Agreement is subject to the adoption by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Magellan common stock and the Board’s belief that Magellan’s directors and executive officers
do not own a significant enough interest in Magellan common stock, in the aggregate, to influence
substantially the outcome of such vote; and
•
the Board’s view that the Merger Agreement was the product of arms’-length negotiation and contained
customary terms and conditions.
Timing of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the structure of the transaction as a Merger and concluded that the
Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner. The Board also considered that the
potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the period during which Magellan’s business
would be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.
Availability of Appraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under Delaware law to
Magellan’s stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who otherwise
comply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law, which provides those eligible stockholders with an
opportunity to have the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determine the fair value of their shares of
Magellan common stock, which may be more than, less than or the same as the amount such stockholders would
have received under the Merger Agreement.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered certain risks and other potentially negative factors
concerning the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including:
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the fact that, following the Merger, Magellan will no longer exist as an independent public company and
Magellan’s existing stockholders will not participate in Magellan’s or Centene’s future earnings or growth
or benefit from any synergies resulting from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement precludes Magellan from soliciting alternative proposals;
•
the fact that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, as a result of a failure to
satisfy certain conditions, including the approval by Magellan’s stockholders and the condition requiring
the expiration or termination of the waiting period (or any extension thereof, including any agreement
between a party and a governmental authority not to consummate the transaction before a certain date)
under the HSR Act and the making or receipt, respectively, of certain required regulatory filings and
consents;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Magellan’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which
may delay or prevent Magellan from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action
that it might otherwise take with respect to the operations of Magellan;
•
the fact that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger Consideration will be taxable to Magellan’s
stockholders who are entitled to receive such consideration;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the Merger and the
substantial time and effort of management required to complete the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, which may disrupt Magellan’s business operations;
•
the risks and contingencies related to the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, including the impact on Magellan’s employees and its relationships with
existing and prospective customers, suppliers and other third parties;
•
the requirement that Magellan pay Centene a termination fee equal to $76,530,000 if the Merger Agreement
is terminated under certain circumstances;
•
the risk that, while the Merger is expected to be completed, there can be no assurance that all conditions to
the parties’ obligations to complete the Merger will be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the
Merger may not be completed even if approved by Magellan’s stockholders;
•
the fact that Magellan’s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different from,
and in addition to, those of Magellan’s stockholders (See “The Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger”);
•
the other risks described in and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, see “Risk Factors” in our
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (as updated by subsequent
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q) incorporated by reference herein and “Cautionary Information Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements.”
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive,
but includes the material factors considered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in
connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable
to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its
determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different
factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor,
or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board based its
recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above.",51,54

Although the Company periodically provides guidance regarding its financial performance for the then-current and
following fiscal year, the Company does not publicly disclose other financial forecasts given, among other reasons,
the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of these forecasts and the associated underlying

assumptions. The Company’s senior management does prepare certain internal multi-year financial forecasts,
estimates and other financial and operating data relating to the Company on an annual basis, which are typically
presented to the Board at the Company’s regularly scheduled second quarter Board meeting.
On July 24, 2020, the Company provided to Centene financial forecasts for fiscal years 2020 through 2024 (we refer to
such forecasts as the “July 2020 Forecasts”).
At a meeting of the Board held on October 27, 2020, in connection with the consideration of a potential transaction
with Centene, the July 2020 Forecasts, adjusted by the Company’s management to include a small contingency to
account for unspecified risks that could adversely affect the achievement of certain financial results (we refer to such
forecasts as the “October 2020 Forecasts”), were presented to the Board.
In late December 2020 and early January 2021, in connection with the Merger, the Company’s management prepared
revisions to the October 2020 Forecasts to take into account the delay in implementation of the Medi-Cal PBA
Agreement, significant scope reduction of an additional PBM contract and the non-renewal of another PBM contract,
each of which development had been disclosed to and discussed with Centene during its due diligence review (we
refer to such forecasts as the “January 2021 Forecasts” and, together with the July 2020 Forecasts and October 2020
Forecasts, the “Company Forecasts”). The Company Forecasts exclude the MCC Business. The January 2021
Forecasts were reviewed by the Board during a meeting held on January 3, 2021. The Company’s management
believed that the January 2021 Forecasts appropriately reflected the known and potential impact of the occurrences
incorporated therein. The January 2021 Forecasts were made available to the Board for use in its evaluation of the
Merger and also were provided to Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities, which were directed by the
Company’s management to use and rely only upon the January 2021 Forecasts for purposes of their financial
analyses and fairness opinions.
Notwithstanding the fact that (i) the Board no longer believes certain assumptions underlying the July 2020
Forecasts and the October 2020 Forecasts reflect the Company’s prospects due to the developments described
above, and did not rely on the July 2020 Forecasts or the October 2020 Forecasts in approving the Merger Agreement
and (ii) at the direction of the Company’s management, neither Goldman Sachs nor Guggenheim Securities, both of
which received the July 2020 Forecasts and the October 2020 Forecasts, used or relied on the July 2020 Forecasts or
the October 2020 Forecasts for purposes of their respective financial analyses and fairness opinions, a summary of
the July 2020 Forecasts and October 2020 Forecasts are being included in this proxy statement only to give Magellan
stockholders access to certain non-public information previously made available to the Board, Goldman Sachs,
Guggenheim Securities and Centene, as and to the extent described above.

The inclusion of the Company Forecasts in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of
the Company, Centene or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, them necessarily
predictive of actual future results or material information given the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with
such forecasts.
Although presented with numeric specificity, the Company Forecasts are subjective in many respects and, thus,
subject to interpretation. The Company Forecasts were based on numerous variables, estimates and assumptions
made by Company management at the time prepared, including with respect to industry performance and competition,
general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters
specific to the Company, including the factors listed under “Risk Factors” set forth in the Company’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K (as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, all of
48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement), all of which are difficult to
predict and many of which are beyond the Company’s control. Therefore, the Company cannot provide any
assurance that the assumptions underlying the Company Forecasts will be realized.
Many of the assumptions reflected in the Company Forecasts are subject to change and the Company Forecasts do
not reflect revised prospects for the Company’s business, changes in general business or economic conditions or
any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated at the time such
financial information was prepared. The Company has not updated and does not intend to update or otherwise revise
the Company Forecasts. There can be no assurance that the results reflected in the Company Forecasts will be
realized or that actual results will not materially vary from the Company Forecasts. In addition, the Company
Forecasts cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.
Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on the Company Forecasts included in this proxy statement as
necessarily predictive of actual future events nor construed as financial guidance.
Magellan stockholders are urged to review the Company’s most recent SEC filings for a description of risk factors
with respect to the Company’s business. You should read the sections entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information regarding the risks inherent in forward-looking information
such as the Company Forecasts and “Where You Can Find More Information”.
The Company Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward complying with U.S. General Accepted Accounting
Principles (which we refer to as “GAAP”) (including because certain metrics are non-GAAP measures, and the
forecasts contained therein do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP), the published
guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or
performed any procedures with respect to the Company Forecasts, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other
form of assurance on the Company Forecasts or the achievability of the results reflected in the Company Forecasts,
and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the Company Forecasts. Non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented
in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures such as those used in the Company Forecasts may not
be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies or persons.
For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on
the Company Forecasts. The Company has not made any representation to Centene in the Merger Agreement
concerning any of the Company Forecasts.
The information about the Company Forecasts set forth above does not give effect to the Merger and also does not
take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be consummated.
THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE ABOVE COMPANY FORECASTS
TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE
OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS

At a meeting of the Board, Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its
written opinion dated January 4, 2021, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based
upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $95.00 in cash per
share of Magellan common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of the shares of
Magellan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated January 4, 2021, which sets forth the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in
connection with Goldman Sachs’ opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated herein
by reference. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion set forth as Annex C. Goldman Sachs’ advisory
services and opinion were provided for the information and
49TABLE OF CONTENTS
assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and the opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of Magellan common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any
other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman
Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the Merger Agreement;
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five years ended
December 31, 2019;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company;
•
certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved
for Goldman Sachs’ use by the Company (referred to in this section as the “January 2021 Forecasts” and
which are summarized in the section entitled “-Certain Forecasts” beginning on page 46).
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their
assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Magellan common stock; compared certain financial
and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the healthcare
industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Board, relied upon and assumed the
accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to,
discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification
thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Board that the January 2021 Forecasts were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
the Company. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities
(including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed
that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger
would be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or Centene or on the expected benefits of the Merger
in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed that the Merger would be consummated on the terms
set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which
would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the
Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the
Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to
solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination
with, the Company or any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of the shares of Magellan common stock,
as of the date of its opinion, of the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs did not express any view on, and its opinion does not address,
any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or
instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger,
including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any
other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or
nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or
class of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan
common stock to be paid to the holders (other than
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Centene and its affiliates) of the shares of Magellan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise.
Goldman Sachs did not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Magellan common stock would
trade at any time or, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company,
Centene or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or Centene or
the ability of the Company or Centene to pay their respective obligations when they would come due. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no
responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events
occurring after the date of the opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and its opinion were provided for the
information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and such opinion does
not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Magellan common stock should vote with respect
to the Merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to the Board in
connection with Goldman Sachs’ rendering to the Board of the opinion described above. The following summary,
however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor
does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman
Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables
must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’
financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on
market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 31, 2020, the last completed trading day
before public announcement of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Implied Premia and Multiples
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied premia and implied multiples described below based on the
$95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of
the shares of Magellan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement:
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock
relative to:
•
$82.84, the closing price of shares of Magellan common stock on December 31, 2020, the last completed
trading day before Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion (which we refer to as the “Current Price”);
•
$87.52, the highest closing trading price of shares of Magellan common stock over the 52-week period
ended December 31, 2020 (which we refer to as the “52-Week High”);
•
$80.29, the volume weighted average price (which we refer to as “VWAP”) of shares of Magellan common
stock over the 30-trading-day period ended December 31, 2020 (which we refer to as the “30-Day VWAP”);
•
$79.42, the VWAP of the shares of Magellan common stock over the 60-trading-day period ended December
31, 2020 (which we refer to as the “60-Day VWAP”); and
•
$77.91, the VWAP of the shares of Magellan common stock over the 90-trading-day period ended December
31, 2020 (which we refer to as the “90-Day VWAP”).

In addition, Goldman Sachs calculated an implied equity value of the Company by multiplying the $95.00 in cash per
share of Company common stock by the total number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock outstanding
as of December 28, 2020, calculated using information provided by the Company’s management and the treasury
stock method. Goldman Sachs then calculated an implied enterprise value of the Company by adding to the implied
equity value it had calculated the Company’s net debt (defined for this purpose as the Company’s debt as of
September 30, 2020, as reflected in the Company’s publicly available filings, less the Company’s unrestricted cash and
short term investments balance as of September 30, 2020, as reflected in the Company’s publicly available filings,
adjusted to include $932 million of net proceeds from the MCC Business Sale, $67 million of collections in November
2020 stemming from the Company’s wind down of the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and to exclude $91
million in investments made by the Company in December 2020 and $32 million and $25 million of Medicare Part D
prescription drug plan collections to be received by the Company in 2021 and 2022, respectively, as provided by
Company management).
Using the foregoing, Goldman Sachs calculated the following multiples:
•
The implied enterprise value for the Company as a multiple of the estimated earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (which we refer to as “EBITDA”) of the Company for calendar years 2021 and
2022, as reflected in the January 2021 Forecasts.
•
The $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock as a multiple of estimated earnings per share
(which we refer to as “EPS”) of the Company for calendar years 2021 and 2022, as reflected in the January
2021 Forecasts.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using the January 2021 Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the
Company to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Magellan common stock.
Using discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 8.0%, reflecting estimates of the Company’s weighted average cost of
capital, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for the Company, by discounting to present
value as of September 30, 2020, (a) the estimates of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by the Company for
the period from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024, as reflected in the January 2021 Forecasts, and (b) a range of
illustrative terminal values for the Company, calculated by applying a range of terminal year EBITDA exit multiples of
6.5x to 8x to the Company’s estimated terminal year EBITDA as reflected in the
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
January 2021 Forecasts (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from negative 0.6% to 1.7%).
Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain
company-specific inputs, including the company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt,
future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United
States financial markets generally. The range of terminal year EBITDA exit multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs
utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical next twelve months (which we refer
to as “NTM”) enterprise value/EBITDA multiples for the Company over the past five years. For purposes of this
analysis, Goldman Sachs used a mid-year discounting convention, except that Goldman Sachs used end of year
discounting for the net proceeds from the MCC Business Sale and collections in November 2020 stemming from the
Company’s wind down of its Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and the impact of the investments made by the
Company in December 2020.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the ranges of present
values it calculated for the unlevered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described above. Goldman
Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it had derived the Company’s net debt as of
September 30, 2020 (defined for this purpose as the Company’s debt as of September 30, 2020, as reflected in the
Company’s publicly available filings, less the Company’s unrestricted cash and short term investments balance as of
September 30, 2020, as reflected in the Company’s publicly available filings), to derive a range of illustrative equity
values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values by the implied total
number of fully diluted shares of Magellan common stock as of December 28, 2020, based on the derived range of
illustrative equity values, and calculated using information provided by Company management and the treasury
stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Magellan common stock of $85.55 to
$100.89.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of
Magellan common stock, based on theoretical future prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for the shares of common
stock.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of Magellan common stock as of
January 1 of each of 2022, 2023 and 2024 by applying illustrative NTM P/E multiples ranging from 16.0x to 24.0x to
estimates of the EPS of the Company for each of 2022, 2023 and 2024 as reflected in the January 2021 Forecasts and
assuming, per Company management, that the net proceeds from the MCC Business Sale would be used to repay
debt at maturity. By applying a discount rate of 8.5%, reflecting an estimate of the Company’s cost of equity, Goldman
Sachs discounted to present value, as of September 30, 2020, the theoretical future values per share it derived for
each applicable year, to yield present values per share of Magellan common stock ranging from $56.61 to $98.30.
The illustrative NTM P/E multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by Goldman Sachs using its
professional judgement and experience, taking into account historical NTM P/E multiples for the Company over the
past five years. Goldman Sachs derived the discount rate used in the foregoing analysis by application of the capital
asset pricing model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as
certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.
Premia Paid Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data obtained from Thomson and DataStream, the
premia paid in acquisitions of publicly traded healthcare companies (excluding biotech companies) in the United
States (which we refer to as “Healthcare Acquisitions”) announced during the period from December 31, 2010
through December 31, 2020 in which the target company had an implied enterprise value of $1 billion to $5 billion. For
each calendar year through December 31, 2020, Goldman Sachs calculated the premia of the price paid in all
Healthcare Acquisitions announced during such period as well as in any all-cash Healthcare Acquisitions
announced during such period, in each case, relative to the target company’s closing share price at the 1-trading day
prior to the announcement of the transaction. For the entire period from December 31, 2010 through December 31,
2020, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, mean, 25th percentile and 75th percentile

Based on its review of the foregoing data and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a
reference range of illustrative premia of 15%-60% (based on the average premia paid in the 25th percentile and 75th
percentile of Healthcare Acquisitions announced in the entire period relative to the target company’s share price over
the 1-trading day prior to the original announcement of the transaction) to the Current Price. This analysis resulted in
a range of implied values per share of Magellan common stock of $95.27 to $132.54.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to certain acquisition transactions announced
since November 1, 2006 involving target companies in the behavioral health and pharmacy benefit management
industry with a transaction value greater than $1 billion.
While none of the target companies in the selected transactions are directly comparable to the Company and none of
the selected transactions are directly comparable to the proposed transaction, the target companies in the selected
transactions are companies with certain operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to
certain operations of the Company.
Using publicly available information, for each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated the implied
enterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction, as a
multiple of the target company’s estimated EBITDA for the twelve month period ended prior to announcement of
each applicable transaction (which we refer to as “LTM EBITDA”), as disclosed in public company filings and other
publicly available information. The selected transactions and the implied enterprise value to LTM EBITDA multiples
calculated for the transactions are set forth below.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ analyses of the various transactions and its
professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of enterprise value to LTM EBITDA
multiples of 9.5x to 13.5x (representing the 25th and 75th quartiles of the implied enterprise value to
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
LTM EBITDA multiples calculated for the transactions as described above) to the Company’s estimated EBITDA for
the Company’s fiscal year 2020 (excluding, at the direction of the Company’s management, the net proceeds from the
MCC Business Sale), as reflected in the January 2021 Forecasts, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the
Company. Goldman Sachs subtracted from this range of implied enterprise values the Company’s net debt as of
September 30, 2020 (defined for this purpose as the Company’s debt as of September 30, 2020, as reflected in the
Company’s publicly available filings, less the Company’s unrestricted cash and short term investments balance as of
September 30, 2020, as reflected in the Company’s publicly available filings), and divided the result by the implied
total number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock outstanding as of December 28, 2020, based on the
derived range of illustrative equity values, and calculated using information provided by management and the
treasury stock method, to derive a range of implied values per share of Company common stock of $59.80 to $79.09.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the
analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In
arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.
No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or
Centene or the Merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Board as to the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of the shares of Magellan common stock,
as of the date of the opinion, of the $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect
the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon projections of future results
are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon
numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company,
Centene, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from
those forecast.
The consideration of $95.00 in cash per share of Magellan common stock was determined through arm’s-length
negotiations between the Company and Centene and was approved by the Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to
the Board during the Company’s negotiations with Centene in connection with the Merger Agreement. Goldman
Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or that any specific
amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the
Board in making its determination to approve the Merger. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion to the
Board and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, attached as Annex C to
this proxy statement.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and
trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various
persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in
which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold
or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit
default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Centene, any of their respective affiliates and third
parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Merger. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial
advisor to the Company in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Merger.
Goldman Sachs expects to receive fees for its services in connection with the Merger, all of which are contingent
upon consummation of the Merger, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of Goldman Sachs’ expenses
arising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities that may arise, out of its engagement. Goldman Sachs
has provided certain financial advisory and/or
55
TABLE OF CONTENTS
underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division
has received, and may receive, compensation. During the two year period ended January 4, 2021, Goldman Sachs has
recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking
Division to the Company and/or its affiliates of approximately $100,000. During the two year period ended January 4,
2021, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by Centene or its affiliates to
provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman
Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Centene and
their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division may receive compensation.
The Company selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to an engagement letter
between the Company and Goldman Sachs, dated January 10, 2017 (as reinstated and amended pursuant to a
reinstatement of engagement letter, dated October 27, 2020), the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its
financial advisors in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter provides for a transaction fee that is
estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $13 million, all of
which is contingent upon completion of the Merger. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs
for certain of its expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs
and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Overview
The Board retained Guggenheim Securities as its financial advisor in connection with the potential sale of the
Company. In selecting Guggenheim Securities as its financial advisor, the Board considered, among other things, that
Guggenheim Securities is an internationally recognized investment banking, financial advisory and securities firm
whose senior professionals have substantial experience advising companies in, among other industries, the
healthcare industry. Guggenheim Securities, as part of its investment banking, financial advisory and capital markets
businesses, is regularly engaged in the valuation and financial assessment of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, recapitalizations, spin-offs/split-offs, restructurings, securities offerings in
both the private and public capital markets and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
At a meeting of the Board on January 3, 2021, Guggenheim Securities rendered an oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the Board to the effect that, as of January 4, 2021 and
based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various
limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of shares of Magellan common stock.
This description of Guggenheim Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the written opinion,
which is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and which you should read carefully and in its entirety.
Guggenheim Securities’ written opinion sets forth the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions
made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken by Guggenheim Securities. Guggenheim
Securities’ written opinion, which was authorized for issuance by the Fairness Opinion and Valuation Committee of
Guggenheim Securities, is necessarily based on economic, business, capital markets and other conditions, and the
information made available to Guggenheim Securities, as of the date of such opinion. As the Company was aware,
global economic conditions and the global capital markets were experiencing and remained subject to significant
volatility, and Guggenheim Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any potential effects of such volatility on
the Company, Centene or the Merger. Guggenheim Securities has no responsibility for updating or revising its
opinion based on facts, circumstances or events occurring after the date of the rendering of the opinion.
In reading the discussion of Guggenheim Securities’ opinion set forth below, you should be aware that such opinion

evaluation of the Merger Consideration;

Merger Agreement or to be entered into or amended in connection with the Merger or (ii) the fairness,
financial or otherwise, of the Merger to, or of any consideration to be paid to or received by, the holders of

of the Company; and
•

compensation payable to or to be received by any of the Company’s directors, officers or employees, or
any class of such persons, in connection with the Merger relative to the Merger Consideration or
otherwise.
In the course of performing its reviews and analyses for rendering its opinion, Guggenheim Securities:
•
reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated as of January 2, 2021;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information regarding the Company;
•
reviewed certain non-public business and financial information regarding the Company’s business and
future prospects (including certain financial projections for Magellan on a standalone basis for the years
ending December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2024, referenced in this section as the “January 2021
Forecasts” (which are summarized in the section entitled “-Certain Forecasts” beginning on page 46) and
certain other estimates and other forward-looking information), all as prepared and approved for
Guggenheim Securities’ use by the Company’s senior management (collectively, referenced in this section
as the “Company-Provided Information”);
•
discussed with the Company’s senior management their views of the Company’s business, operations,
historical and projected financial results and future prospects and the commercial, competitive and
regulatory dynamics in the healthcare sector;

of Magellan common stock with corresponding data for certain other publicly traded companies that
Guggenheim Securities deemed relevant in evaluating the Company; and
•
conducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as Guggenheim Securities deemed
appropriate.
With respect to the information used in arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities noted that:
•
Guggenheim Securities relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all
industry, business, financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information provided by
or discussed with the Company (including, without limitation, the Company-Provided Information) or
obtained from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Guggenheim Securities (i) did not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy,
completeness, reasonableness, achievability or independent verification of, and Guggenheim Securities did
not independently verify, any such information (including, without limitation, the Company-Provided
Information), (ii) expressed no view or opinion regarding the reasonableness or achievability of the January
2021 Forecasts, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information provided by the Company
or the assumptions upon which any of the foregoing are based and (iii) relied upon the assurances of the
Company’s senior management that they were unaware of any facts or circumstances that would make the
Company-Provided Information incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.
•
Specifically, with respect to (i) the January 2021 Forecasts utilized in its analyses, (a) Guggenheim Securities
was advised by the Company’s senior management, and Guggenheim Securities assumed, that the January
2021 Forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then-currently available
estimates and judgments of the Company’s senior management as to the expected future performance of
the Company on a stand-alone basis and (b) Guggenheim Securities assumed that the January 2021
Forecasts had been reviewed by the Board with the understanding that such information would be used
and relied upon by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its opinion and (ii) any financial
projections/forecasts, any other estimates and/or any other forward-looking information obtained by
Guggenheim Securities from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties, Guggenheim Securities
assumed that such information was reasonable and reliable.
Guggenheim Securities also noted certain other considerations with respect to its engagement and the rendering of
its opinion:
•
During the course of its engagement, Guggenheim Securities was not asked by the Board to, and
Guggenheim Securities did not, solicit indications of interest from any potential third-party transaction
counterparties regarding a potential extraordinary corporate transaction with or involving the Company.
•
Guggenheim Securities did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(including any contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any
other entity or the solvency or fair value of the Company or any other entity, nor was Guggenheim
Securities furnished with any such appraisals.
•
Guggenheim Securities’ professionals are not legal, regulatory, tax, consulting, accounting, appraisal or
actuarial experts and nothing in Guggenheim Securities’ opinion should be construed as constituting
advice with respect to such matters; accordingly, Guggenheim Securities relied on the assessments of the
Company’s senior management and the Company’s other professional advisors with respect to such
matters.
Guggenheim Securities further assumed that:
•
in all respects meaningful to its analyses, (i) the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ from the
draft that Guggenheim Securities reviewed, (ii) the Company, Centene and Merger Sub would comply with
all terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the representations and warranties of the
Company, Centene and Merger Sub contained in the Merger Agreement were true and correct and all
conditions to the obligations of each party to the Merger Agreement to consummate the Merger would be
satisfied without any waiver, amendment or modification thereof;
•
the Merger would be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement and in compliance with all applicable legal and other requirements, without any delays,
limitations, restrictions, conditions, divestiture or other requirements, waivers, amendments or
modifications (regulatory, tax-related or otherwise) that would have an effect on the Company or the
Merger in any way meaningful to Guggenheim Securities’ analyses or opinion; and
Guggenheim Securities did not express any view or opinion as to the price or range of prices at which shares of
Magellan common stock or other securities or financial instruments of or relating to the Company may trade or
otherwise be transferable at any time, including subsequent to the announcement or consummation of the Merger.

Summary of Financial Analyses
Overview of Financial Analyses
This “Summary of Financial Analyses” presents a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by
Guggenheim Securities and presented to the Board in connection with Guggenheim Securities’ rendering of its
opinion. Such presentation to the Board was supplemented by Guggenheim Securities’ oral discussion, the nature
and substance of which may not be fully described herein.
Some of the financial analyses summarized below include summary data and information presented in tabular format.
In order to understand fully such financial analyses, the summary data and tables must be read together with the full
text of the summary. Considering the summary data and tables alone could create a misleading or incomplete view of
Guggenheim Securities’ financial analyses.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances involved. A fairness opinion therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description, and taking portions of the financial analyses set forth below, without considering such analyses as a
whole, would in Guggenheim Securities’ view create an incomplete and misleading picture of the processes
underlying the financial analyses considered in rendering Guggenheim Securities’ opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities:
•
based its financial analyses on various assumptions, including assumptions concerning general economic,
business and capital markets conditions and industry-specific and company-specific factors, all of which
are beyond the control of the Company, Centene and Guggenheim Securities;
•
did not form a view or opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor, whether positive or negative,
considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion;
•
considered the results of all of its financial analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any one
analysis or factor; and
•
ultimately arrived at its opinion based on the results of all of its financial analyses assessed as a whole and
believes that the totality of the factors considered and the various financial analyses performed by
Guggenheim Securities in connection with its opinion operated collectively to support its determination as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, of the Merger
Consideration to the holders of shares of Magellan common stock to the extent expressly specified in such
opinion.
With respect to the financial analyses performed by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its opinion:
•
Such financial analyses, particularly those based on estimates and projections, are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses.
•
None of the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions used in the selected precedent merger
and acquisition transactions analysis described below is identical or directly comparable to the Merger, and
none of the selected publicly traded companies used in the selected publicly traded companies analysis
described below is identical or directly comparable to the Company or Centene. However, such companies
and transactions were selected by Guggenheim Securities, among other reasons, because they represented
publicly traded companies or involved target companies which may be considered broadly similar, for
purposes of Guggenheim Securities’ financial analyses, to the Company and Centene based on
Guggenheim Securities’ familiarity with the healthcare industry.
•
In any event, selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis and selected publicly traded
companies analysis are not mathematical. Rather, such analyses involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning the differences in business, operating, financial and capital markets-related
characteristics and other factors regarding the selected publicly traded companies to which the Company
and Centene were compared and the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions to which the
Merger was compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Guggenheim Securities performed a stand-alone discounted cash flow analysis of
the Company based on projected unlevered free cash flows for the Company and an estimate of the Company’s
terminal/continuing value at the end of the projection horizon.
In performing its discounted cash flow analysis with respect to the Company:
•
Guggenheim Securities utilized the January 2021 Forecasts.
•
Guggenheim Securities used a discount rate range of 7.5% - 8.5% based on its estimate of the Company’s
weighted average cost of capital (which was estimated based on Guggenheim Securities’ (i) investment
banking and capital markets judgment and experience in valuing companies similar to the Company and (ii)
application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain (a) general inputs such as the
prospective U.S. equity risk premium and the corresponding risk-free rate and (b) company-specific inputs
such as the subject company’s forward-looking equity beta reference range, the subject company’s
assumed forward-looking capital structure and the corresponding blended cost of debt, the subject
company’s prospective marginal cash income tax rate and, as applicable, the appropriate size/liquidity
premium for the subject company).
•
In estimating the Company’s terminal/continuing value for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis,
Guggenheim Securities used a reference range of perpetual growth rates of the Company’s terminal year
unlevered free cash flow of 1.0% - 2.0%. Guggenheim Securities selected such terminal/continuing value-
related perpetual growth rates based on its professional judgment, taking into account various
considerations and factors, including among others (i) the nature of the Company’s businesses, including
recent and expected trends in and competitive dynamics with respect to, and expected long-term growth
prospects for, the industry and markets in which the Company operates, (ii) the January 2021 Forecasts and
(iii) then-prevailing market expectations regarding U.S. long-term economic growth and U.S. long-term
inflation. The terminal/continuing values implied by the foregoing perpetual growth rate reference range
were cross-checked for reasonableness by reference to the Company’s implied terminal year EBITDA
multiples.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Guggenheim Securities’ discounted cash flow analysis resulted in an overall reference range of $87.75 - $111.50 per
share.
Selected Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transactions Analysis. Guggenheim Securities reviewed and analyzed
certain financial metrics associated with selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions announced since
January 1, 2006 involving target companies in the pharmacy & specialty benefit managers and behavioral health
sectors, and target companies in the managed care sector that Guggenheim Securities deemed relevant for purposes
of this analysis. Guggenheim Securities calculated, among other things and to the extent publicly available, certain
implied change-of-control transaction multiples for the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions (based
on Wall Street equity research consensus estimates, each company’s most recent publicly available financial filings
and certain other publicly available information), which are summarized in the table below:

Pro forma for Molina’s acquisition of Affinity Health Plan and the MCC Business
In performing its selected publicly traded companies analysis with respect to the Company, Guggenheim Securities
selected a reference range of trading price / adjusted earnings per share multiple of 13.0x - 18.0x, based on
Guggenheim Securities’ professional judgment, and applied that range to CY 2021E EPS (adjusted, at the direction of
the Company’s management, to exclude interest income associated with proceeds from the MCC Business Sale) for
purposes of evaluating the Company on a stand-alone public market trading basis, which resulted in an overall
reference range of $71.25-$85.00 per share for purposes of evaluating shares of Company common stock on a stand-
alone public market trading basis.
Other Financial Reviews Solely for Informational Reference Purposes
In order to obtain certain context for the financial analyses in connection with its opinion as described above,
Guggenheim Securities undertook various additional financial reviews as summarized below solely for informational
reference purposes. As a general matter, Guggenheim Securities did not consider such additional financial reviews to
be determinative methodologies for purposes of its opinion.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
High and Low Stock Prices since MCC Business Sale Announcement. Guggenheim Securities reviewed the trading
price of shares of Company common stock for the period beginning April 30, 2020 (the announcement date of the
MCC Business Sale) and ending December 31, 2020. Among other things, Guggenheim Securities noted that the
range of such high and low trading prices was $57.38-$87.52.
Wall Street Equity Research Analyst Stock Price Targets. Guggenheim Securities reviewed selected Wall Street
equity research analyst stock price targets for the Company as published prior to December 31, 2020. Guggenheim
Securities noted that such Wall Street equity research analyst stock price targets for the shares of Magellan common
stock were $92.00-$98.00 per share.
Other Considerations
Except as described in the summary above, the Company did not provide specific instructions to, or place any
limitations on, Guggenheim Securities with respect to the procedures to be followed or factors to be considered in
performing its financial analyses or providing its opinion. The type and amount of consideration payable in the
Merger were determined through negotiations between the Company and Centene and were approved by the Board.
The Company’s decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. Guggenheim Securities’
opinion was just one of the many factors taken into consideration by the Board. Consequently, Guggenheim
Securities’ financial analyses should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Board with respect to the
fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of Guggenheim Securities’ opinion, of the Merger
Consideration to the holders of shares of Magellan common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of Guggenheim Securities’ engagement, the Company has agreed to pay Guggenheim Securities
a cash transaction fee entirely contingent upon the consummation of the Merger, which cash transaction fee is
estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $13 million. In
addition, the Company agreed to reimburse Guggenheim Securities for certain expenses and to indemnify
Guggenheim Securities against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
Aside from its current engagement by the Company, Guggenheim Securities has not been previously engaged during
the past two years by the Company and/or its affiliates known to Guggenheim Securities, nor has Guggenheim
Securities been previously engaged during the past two years by Centene and/or its affiliates known to Guggenheim
Securities, to provide financial advisory, capital markets or investment banking services for which Guggenheim
Securities has received compensation. Guggenheim Securities may seek to provide the Company and Centene and
their respective affiliates with financial advisory, capital markets and investment banking services unrelated to the
Merger in the future, for which services Guggenheim Securities would expect to receive compensation.
Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for
its and their own accounts and the accounts of customers, including but not limited to: asset, investment and wealth
management; insurance services; investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring;
merchant banking; fixed income and equity sales, trading and research; and derivatives, foreign exchange and
futures. In the ordinary course of these activities, Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities may (i)
provide such financial services to the Company, Centene, other participants in the Merger and their respective
affiliates, for which services Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities may have received, and may
in the future receive, compensation and (ii) directly and indirectly hold long and short positions, trade and otherwise
conduct such activities in or with respect to loans, debt and equity securities and derivative products of or relating to
the Company, Centene, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates. Furthermore, Guggenheim
Securities and its affiliates and related entities and Guggenheim Securities’ or their respective directors, officers,
employees, consultants and agents may have investments in the Company, Centene, other participants in the Merger
and their respective affiliates.
Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, Guggenheim Securities has adopted certain policies and
procedures to establish and maintain the independence of its research departments and personnel. As a result,
Guggenheim Securities’ research analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and
publish research reports with respect to the Company, Centene, other participants in the Merger and their respective
affiliates that differ from the views of Guggenheim Securities’ investment banking personnel.

Members of our Board and our executive officers have various interests in the Merger described in this section that
may be in addition to, or different from, the interests of the Company stockholders generally. You should keep this in
mind when considering the recommendation of the Board for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. The members of
the Board were aware of these interests and considered them at the time they approved the Merger Agreement and in
making their recommendation that Magellan stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests are
described below.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be
accurate as of the date referenced; therefore, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable may
materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that, as of the Effective Time:
•
each outstanding Company Option will be converted into an adjusted option with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
double-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the
Company’s retirement policy) and relating to the number of shares of Centene common stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock subject to such Company Option, multiplied
by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole
share. The exercise price per share of Centene common stock subject to any adjusted option will be an
amount equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Magellan common stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio,
with any fractional cents rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The exercise price per share of Centene
common stock subject to any adjusted option and the number of shares of Centene common stock subject
to any such adjusted option will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code, and, in the case of Company Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of
the Code;
•
each outstanding Company PSU will be converted into a restricted stock unit with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
double-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the
Company’s retirement policy, but excluding the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such
Company PSU which will not apply from and after the Effective Time) and relating to the number of shares
of Centene common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock
subject to such Company PSU based on the achievement of the applicable performance metrics at the
target level of performance, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares
rounded to the nearest whole share;
•
each outstanding Company RSA, other than those granted to nonemployee members of the Board, will be
converted into a restricted share award with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Company RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time (including double-trigger vesting and all other
provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the Company’s retirement policy) and
relating to the number of shares of Centene common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Magellan common stock subject to such Company RSA, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange
Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share;
•
each outstanding Company Director RSA will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each share of Magellan common stock subject to such Company Director RSA,
payable as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) business days
after the Effective Time;
•
each outstanding Company RSU will be converted into a restricted stock unit with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
double-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award
65TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreements and the Company’s retirement policy) and relating to the number of shares of Centene common
stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock subject to such Company
RSU, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest
whole share; and
•
each outstanding Company PCU will be converted into a phantom cash unit with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company PCU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
double-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the
Company’s retirement policy) and relating to the number of shares of Centene common stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock subject to such Company PCU, multiplied
by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share.
The estimated aggregated amounts that would become payable to each nonemployee member of the Board in respect
of his or her equity awards is as follows: Steven J. Shulman, $201,590; Swati Abbot, $201,590; Christopher J. Chen,
$201,590; Peter A. Feld, $201,590; Mural R. Josephson, $201,590; G. Scott Mackenzie, $201,590; Leslie V. Norwalk,
$201,590; and Guy P. Sansone, $201,590. Accordingly, the estimated aggregate amount that would become payable to
all of the nonemployee members of the Board is $1,612,720.
Because the Merger Agreement does not provide for the acceleration and “cash-out” of any Company equity awards
held by the Company’s executive officers, no executive officer will receive payments in respect of his or her Company
equity awards as a result of the Merger unless such executive officer is subject to a Qualifying Termination (as
defined below) during the Protection Period (as defined below), except that the Merger will result in the single-trigger
acceleration of a portion of Mr. Fasola’s outstanding equity awards, as summarized below in the section entitled “-
New Arrangement with Centene,” beginning on page 69. None of the executives hold Company PCUs or participate
in the ESPP.
See the section below entitled “-Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 69 for an estimate of the
payments to which each of the Company’s named executive officers would be entitled in respect of his or her equity
awards upon a termination of the named executive officer’s employment by the Company without “cause” or due to
the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and agreements,
a “Qualifying Termination”) occurring immediately following the Effective Time and the estimated aggregate values of
Mr. Fasola’s outstanding equity awards subject to single-trigger acceleration in connection with the Merger. Further,
based on the assumptions described below, the estimated amount that would be payable in respect of the equity
awards held by Ms. Lewis-Clapper assuming a Qualifying Termination that occurs immediately following the Effective
Time is as follows: Company Options - $316,958, Company PSUs - $1,025,403 and Company RSUs - $657,357.
Employment Agreements with Executive Officers
The Company entered into employment agreements (we refer to each such agreement as an “Employment
Agreement” and, collectively, the “Employment Agreements”) with Messrs. Fasola, Bourdon, Haddock, Kamal,
Murray and Rubin and Ms. Lewis-Clapper.
Under the Employment Agreement with Mr. Fasola, upon a termination by the Company without “cause” (including
by the Company's nonrenewal of the term) or a resignation by the executive for “good reason” (as such terms are
defined in the executive’s Employment Agreement), Mr. Fasola is entitled to the following severance payments and
benefits: (i) one and one-half times the sum of base salary plus target bonus payable over an 18-month period, (ii)
reimbursement of the Company’s portion of health insurance premiums for a period of up to 18 months after the date
of termination, (iii) pro-rata annual bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance, (iv) continued
vesting of the executive’s sign-on Company PSUs and (v) full acceleration of the executive’s sign-on Company RSUs.
If such termination by the Company without “cause” or resignation by the executive for “good reason” occurs on or
prior to and in connection with, or within two years following a “change in control” (as defined in the executive’s
Employment Agreement), then, in addition to the forgoing severance, Mr. Fasola is entitled to one and one-half times
the sum of base salary plus target bonus payable in a single installment immediately upon termination. The payments
and benefits are subject to the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims. Any
payments under the executive’s Employment Agreement or another agreement or arrangement applicable to the
executive that would constitute “parachute payments” under Section 280G of the Code will either be reduced to the
extent necessary to avoid excise taxes,
66

or will be paid in full, whichever would result in net greater payments to the executive on an after-tax basis. For details
regarding modifications to Mr. Fasola’s Employment Agreement that will go into effect upon the consummation of the
Merger, see the section entitled “-New Arrangement with Centene” beginning on page 69.
Under the Employment Agreement with Mr. Bourdon, upon a termination by the Company without “cause”
(including by the Company’s nonrenewal of the term) or a resignation by the executive for “good reason” (as such
terms are defined in the executive’s Employment Agreement), Mr. Bourdon is entitled to the following severance
payments and benefits: (i) one times base salary payable over a 12-month period, (ii) reimbursement of the company’s
portion of health insurance premiums for a period of up to 12 months after the date of termination, and (iii) pro-rata
annual bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance. The foregoing payments and benefits are
subject to the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims. If such termination by the
Company without “cause” or resignation by the executive for “good reason” is in connection with, or within two
years following, a “change in control” (as defined in the executive’s Employment Agreement), then, in addition to the
foregoing severance, Mr. Bourdon is entitled to (a) the sum of one times base salary plus two times target bonus
payable in a single installment immediately upon termination, and (b) reimbursement of the Company’s portion of
health insurance premiums for a period of up to 6 additional months after the date of termination, (c) full acceleration
of the executive’s sign-on Company RSUs, and (d) full acceleration of the executive’s sign-on Company PSUs at
target level. Any payments under the executive’s Employment Agreement or another agreement or arrangement
applicable to the executive that would constitute “parachute payments” under Section 280G of the Code will either be
reduced to the extent necessary to avoid excise taxes, or will be paid in full, whichever would result in net greater
payments to the executive on an after-tax basis.
Under the Employment Agreement with Mr. Haddock, upon a termination by the Company without “cause”
(including by the Company's nonrenewal of the term) or a resignation by the executive for “good reason” (as such
terms are defined in the executive’s Employment Agreement), Mr. Haddock is entitled to the following severance
payments and benefits: (i) one times base salary payable over a 12-month period, (ii) reimbursement of the company’s
portion of health insurance premiums for a period of up to 12 months after the date of termination, and (iii) pro-rata
annual bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance. The foregoing payments and benefits are
subject to the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims. If such termination by the
Company without “cause” or resignation by the executive for “good reason” is in connection with a “change in
control” (as defined in the executive’s Employment Agreement) that occurs 18 months or longer after the executive’s
commencement date, or within two years following a change in control, then, in addition to the foregoing severance,
Mr. Haddock is entitled to (a) the sum of one times base salary plus two times target bonus payable in a single
installment immediately upon termination, (b) reimbursement of the company’s portion of health insurance premiums
for a period of up to 6 additional months after the date of termination, (c) full acceleration of the executive’s sign-on
RSUs, and (d) full acceleration of the executive’s sign-on Company PSUs at target level. Any payments under the
executive’s Employment Agreement or another agreement or arrangement applicable to the executive that would
constitute “parachute payments” under Section 280G of the Code will either be reduced to the extent necessary to
avoid excise taxes, or will be paid in full, whichever would result in net greater payments to the executive on an after-
tax basis.
Under the Employment Agreement with Mr. Kamal, upon a termination by the Company without “cause” (including
by the Company's nonrenewal of the term) or a resignation by the executive for “good reason” (as such terms are
defined in the executive’s Employment Agreement), Mr. Kamal is entitled to the following severance payments: (i) one
times base salary payable over a 12-month period, (ii) in the sole discretion of the Company, pro-rata annual bonus
for the year of termination, and (iii) reimbursement of the Company’s portion of health insurance premiums for a
period of up to 12 months after the date of termination. If such termination by the Company without “cause” or
resignation by the executive for “good reason” is in connection with, or within two years following, a “change in
control” (as defined in the executive’s Employment Agreement), Mr. Kamal is entitled to the following severance
payments and benefits, in lieu of the foregoing severance: (a) two times the sum of base salary plus target bonus
payable in a single installment immediately upon termination, (b) reimbursement of the Company’s portion of health
insurance premiums for a period of up to 18 months after the date of termination, (c) pro-rata annual bonus for the
year of termination based on target amount, and (d) full acceleration of the executive’s outstanding Company PSUs at
target level. The payments and benefits are subject to the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a general
release of claims. Any

payments under the executive’s Employment Agreement or another agreement or arrangement applicable to the
executive that would constitute “parachute payments” under Section 280G of the Code will either be reduced to the
extent necessary to avoid excise taxes, or will be paid in full, whichever would result in net greater payments to the
executive on an after-tax basis.
Under the Employment Agreement with Ms. Lewis-Clapper, upon a termination by the Company “without cause”
(including by the Company's nonrenewal of the term) (as such term is defined in the executive’s Employment
Agreement), Ms. Lewis-Clapper is entitled to the following severance payments and benefits: (i) one times base
salary payable over a 12-month period, (ii) in the sole discretion of the Company, pro-rata annual bonus for the year
of termination and (iii) reimbursement of the Company’s portion of health insurance premiums for a period of up to 12
months after the date of termination. Upon a termination by the Company without “cause” or resignation by the
executive for “good reason” in connection with a “change in control” (as such terms are defined in the executive’s
Employment Agreement), whether before or at the time of such change in control, or within two years following a
change in control, then Ms. Lewis-Clapper is entitled to the following severance payments and benefits, in lieu of the
foregoing severance: (a) two times the sum of base salary plus target bonus payable in a single installment
immediately upon termination, (b) reimbursement of the Company’s portion of health insurance premiums for a period
of up to 18 months after the date of termination, and (c) pro-rata annual bonus for the year of termination based on
target amount. The payments and benefits are subject to the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a general
release of claims. In addition, Ms. Lewis-Clapper is entitled to receive a tax gross-up payment in the event that
payments made to her in connection with a change in control become subject to an excise tax pursuant to Section
280G and 4999 of the Code.
Under the Employment Agreement with Mr. Murray, upon a termination by the Company without “cause” or a
resignation by the executive for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the executive’s Employment Agreement,
including by the Company’s nonrenewal of the term), Mr. Murray is entitled to the following severance payments and
benefits: (i) one times base salary payable over a 12-month period, (ii) reimbursement of the company’s portion of
health insurance premiums for a period of up to 12 months after the date of termination, (iii) pro-rata annual bonus for
the year of termination based on actual performance, (iv) full acceleration of the executive’s sign-on stock options
and sign-on Company RSUs, and (v) continued vesting of the executive’s sign-on Company PSUs. The foregoing
payments and benefits are subject to the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims. If
such termination by the Company without “cause” or resignation by the executive for “good reason” is on or prior to
and in connection with a “change in control” (as defined in the executive’s Employment Agreement) that occurs 18
months following the executive’s commencement date, or within two years following such change in control, then, in
addition to the foregoing severance, Mr. Murray is entitled to (a) the sum of one times base salary plus two times
target bonus payable in a single installment immediately upon termination, and (b) reimbursement of the company’s
portion of health insurance premiums for a period of up to 6 additional months after the date of termination. Any
payments under the executive’s Employment Agreement or another agreement or arrangement applicable to the
executive that would constitute “parachute payments” under Section 280G of the Code will either be reduced to the
extent necessary to avoid excise taxes, or will be paid in full, whichever would result in net greater payments to the
executive on an after-tax basis.
The Employment Agreement with Mr. Rubin terminated upon his termination of employment with the Company
effective December 31, 2020. Mr. Rubin is not entitled to receive any payments in connection with the Merger.
See the section below entitled “-Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 69 for an estimate of the cash
payment and benefit amounts (in addition to the amounts payable in respect of equity awards) that would be payable
to each of the Company’s named executive officers under the Employment Agreements upon a termination of the
named executive officer’s employment by the Company without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation
for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and agreements, a “Qualifying Termination”) that
occurs immediately following the Effective Time. Further, based on the assumptions described below, the estimated
aggregate value of the cash payment and benefit amounts (in addition to the amiable in respect of equity awards
provided above) that would be payable to Ms. Lewis-Clapper upon a Qualifying Termination that occurs immediately
following the Effective Time is $1,550,524.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Nonqualified Plan Contribution
The Magellan Health, Inc. Supplemental Accumulation Plan (which we refer to as the “SAP”) is a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan that is designed to enhance opportunities for retirement savings for certain executives.
The SAP includes a discretionary component funded by the Company which is determined on an annual basis as a
fixed percentage of an executive’s base salary, and a voluntary deferral component under which the participant may
make contributions from compensation. The discretionary component is offered to a limited group of executive
officers who historically have received this contribution. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, on
or about March 15, 2021, the Company will contribute to Ms. Lewis-Clapper’s SAP account an amount equal to 11%
of base salary in accordance with past practice, subject to Ms. Lewis-Clapper’s continued employment with the
Company through the contribution date (or earlier termination by the Company without “cause” or by the executive
for “good reason” (as each such term is defined in the Company’s form of Notice of Terms of PSU)).
New Arrangement with Centene
In connection with the Merger Agreement, and dated as of the date thereof, Centene entered into a new letter
agreement (which we refer to as the “Letter Agreement”) with Mr. Fasola. Under the Letter Agreement, Centene will
cause the Company or Centene Management Corporation (which we refer to as “CMC”) to continue to honor the
terms of Mr. Fasola’s Employment Agreement (discussed above), as amended by the Letter Agreement; provided,
that the term of the Employment Agreement, as amended by the Letter Agreement, will expire on the 30-month
anniversary of the Effective Time, unless earlier terminated by either party. If the Employment Agreement, as amended
by the Letter Agreement, expires after 30 months and no new employment agreement is agreed, Mr. Fasola will be
treated as having a Qualifying Termination under his Employment Agreement and the Letter Agreement. The Letter
Agreement amends the Employment Agreement as follows: (i) Mr. Fasola will be employed by the Surviving
Corporation or, at the discretion of Centene, CMC, in the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving
Corporation, reporting to Centene’s Senior Vice President, Technology Innovation and Modernization, (ii) the Letter
Agreement sets forth Mr. Fasola’s annual and long term compensation, (iii) Mr. Fasola’s legacy incentive equity
awards that converted into corresponding Centene incentive equity awards in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement (as described above) will vest 50% immediately following the Effective Time, 25% on the second
anniversary of the Effective Time and 25% on the 30-month anniversary following the Effective Time, subject to
continued employment through each vesting date or upon an earlier Qualifying Termination, and (iv)
acknowledgement that the Merger and the changes to Mr. Fasola’s compensation, benefits, duties, responsibilities or
reporting obligations set forth in the Letter Agreement will not constitute “good reason” for purposes of the
Employment Agreement or any other plan or agreement entered into with or sponsored by the Company or any of its
affiliates.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the tables below present the estimated amounts of compensation
that each named executive officer could receive that are based on or otherwise related to the Merger. This
compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this
section we use such term to describe the Merger-related compensation payable to Magellan’s named executive
officers. This Merger-related compensation is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of the Company’s
stockholders. See the section entitled “Proposal 2: Non-Binding Merger-Related Compensation Proposal,” beginning
on page 27.
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in
this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
the relevant price per share of Magellan common stock is $95.00, which is the price per share to be paid in
connection with the Merger and used to calculate the Stock Award Exchange Ratio as of the Effective Time;
•
for purposes of the conversion of Company equity awards to Centene equity awards as described above
under the section entitled “-Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards” beginning on page 65, the price per
share of Centene common stock used to calculate the Stock Award Exchange Ratio on the assumed
effective date of the Merger (as set forth below) is $62.4829810027589, based on the volume weighted
average of the sale prices per share of Centene common stock for the 30 full consecutive trading days
ending on and including February 11, 2021;
69
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the price per share of Centene common stock used to calculate the value of Company PSUs and Company
RSUs is the closing stock price on February 12, 2021;
•
the assumed effective date of the Merger is February 12, 2021, the latest practicable date prior to the filing
of this proxy statement, which is also the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for purposes of
the disclosure in this section, unless noted otherwise; and
•
the employment of each executive officer of the Company will have been terminated without “cause” or due
to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and
agreements, a “Qualifying Termination”), in either case immediately following the assumed effective date of
the Merger on February 12, 2021.
The amounts indicated below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to the named executive officers, and
the estimates are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions
described above in this section entitled “-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on
page 65. Some of the assumptions are based on information not currently available, and as a result, the actual
amounts to be received by a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.
All dollar amounts set forth below have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

The amounts listed reflect “double-trigger” payments payable to each of the named executive officers on a Qualifying
Termination occurring during the applicable protection period set forth under the Employment Agreements (which we refer to as
the “Protection Period”) under each named executive officer’s Employment Agreement. For Mr. Fasola, these estimated cash
severance payments consist of (i) three times the sum of base salary ($3,000,000) plus target bonus ($3,000,000) and (ii) pro-
rata annual bonus ($117,808). For Mr. Bourdon and Mr. Kamal these estimated cash severance payments consist of (i) two times
the sum of base salary plus target bonus and (ii) pro-rata annual bonus. For Mr. Murray and Mr. Haddock these estimated cash
severance payments are the regular amounts payable to each individual upon a Qualifying Termination that is not in connection
with a Change in Control or during the applicable Protection Period and consist of the sum of base salary plus a pro-rata annual
bonus for 2021. For Mr. Bourdon: (1) two times base salary: $1,050,000, (2) two times annual bonus: $892,500, and (3) prorated
annual bonus: $52,572; for Mr. Murray: (1) one times base salary: $750,000, and (2) prorated annual bonus: $75,103; for Mr.
Kamal: (1) two times base salary: $1,180,998, (2) two times annual bonus: $944,798, and (3) prorated annual bonus: $55,653;
and for Mr. Haddock: (1) one times base salary: $525,000, and (2) prorated annual bonus: $40,202. Mr. Rubin terminated
employment with the Company prior to the assumed effective date and is not entitled to amounts triggered by the Merger. For
further details regarding the cash severance that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers, see the section
entitled “-Employment Agreements with Executive Officers,” beginning on page 66.

The amounts listed reflect the value that will be received by each named executive officer in respect of Company Options,
Company RSUs and Company PSUs upon a Qualifying Termination during the Protection Period and for Mr. Fasola, the value of
the accelerated vesting of a portion of his outstanding Company RSUs and Company PSUs immediately following the Effective
Time. The amounts listed in the table below are “double-trigger” payments that are payable to each of the named executive
officers on a Qualifying Termination occurring during the Protection Period. The amounts listed in the table do not include the
value of any Company Options, Company RSUs, or Company PSUs that may be granted in calendar year 2021. Company PSUs
are calculated based on the target number of shares subject to such award. For further details regarding the treatment of Company

The joint press release issued by Centene and Magellan on January 4, 2021, announcing their entry into the Merger
Agreement indicated that members of Magellan's leadership team had agreed to join Centene to provide continuity to
Magellan's strategy and leadership. As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Magellan's leadership team, other
than Mr. Fasola (as described above), have agreed on specific roles or compensation arrangements with Centene.
Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance
For at least six years after the Effective Time, Centene has agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, any current or former officer, director or
employee of the Company against any out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with any actual or threatened action arising out
of or relating to (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or its
subsidiaries, (ii) any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time in such person’s
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time or (iii) the Merger, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, in each case, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any applicable indemnification agreement between the Company or any
of its subsidiaries and such person and the Company’s organizational documents in effect as of the date of the
Merger Agreement.
Further, for at least six years after the Effective Time, Centene has agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation or its
applicable subsidiaries to maintain in effect, for the benefit of any current or former officer, director or employee of the
Company or its subsidiaries, a level and scope of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage at least as
favorable as the level and scope thereof set forth in the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance program
in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, subject to an annual cap of 300% of the annual premium of the
Company’s current policy. If the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed the annual cap, the
Surviving Corporation will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to the annual cap. In
the alternative, the Company may, in consultation with Centene, obtain a prepaid “tail” policy prior to the Effective
Time that provides the current or former officers, directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries with
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for at least six years following the Effective Time; provided that the premium
payable for such “tail” policy will not exceed the annual cap.

If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Magellan common stock entitled to vote on such matter and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are
either satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into
Magellan upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. As the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, Magellan
will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Centene.
Following the Merger, all of Magellan’s equity interests will be legally and beneficially owned by Centene, and none
of Magellan’s current stockholders will, by virtue of the Merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder
of, the Surviving Corporation or Centene after the completion of the Merger. As a result, Magellan’s current
stockholders will no longer benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they bear the risk of any
71TABLE OF CONTENTS
decrease in the value, of Magellan common stock. Following the Merger, Centene will benefit from any increase in
Magellan’s enterprise value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in Magellan’s enterprise value.
Upon completion of the Merger, each Converted Share will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist and will
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-
Merger Consideration Received by Magellan Stockholders,” beginning on page 77.
For information regarding the effects of the Merger on Magellan’s outstanding equity awards, see the section
entitled “The Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 65, and the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards; Company ESPP,” beginning on
page 78.
Magellan common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on the NASDAQ under the
symbol “MGLN.” Following the completion of the Merger, the shares of Magellan common stock will no longer be
traded on the NASDAQ or any other public market. In addition, the registration of the shares of Magellan common
stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated, and Magellan will no longer be required to file periodic and other
reports with the SEC with respect to Magellan common stock. Termination of registration of Magellan common stock
under the Exchange Act will reduce the information required to be furnished by Magellan to Magellan’s stockholders
and the SEC, and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file annual and
quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders’
meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to Magellan to the extent that they
apply solely as a result of the registration of Magellan common stock under the Exchange Act.

If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is not approved by the holders of shares of Magellan common stock
representing a majority of the outstanding shares of Magellan common stock entitled to vote on such matter or if the
Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any consideration from Centene or Merger Sub for
your shares of Magellan common stock. Instead, Magellan will remain a public company, and Magellan common
stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ. We expect that our management will operate our
business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that holders of shares of Magellan
common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities as they currently are subject to with
respect to their ownership of Magellan common stock. If the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as
to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of Magellan common stock, including the risk that
the market price of Magellan common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of Magellan
common stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement is not approved by the holders of shares of Magellan common stock representing a majority of the
outstanding shares of Magellan common stock entitled to vote on such matter or if the Merger is not completed for
any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to us will be offered or that our
business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Magellan is required to pay
Centene a termination fee of $76,530,000. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the disposition of
Magellan common stock in the Merger to stockholders of the Company whose shares of Magellan common stock are
converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger. This summary is for general information purposes only and
does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to stockholders of the
Company. This summary is based on current provisions of the Code, existing, proposed and temporary regulations
thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and
conclusions set forth in this discussion. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) or any opinion of counsel
72TABLE OF CONTENTS
with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be
given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the
IRS.
The summary applies only to stockholders of the Company in whose hands shares of Magellan common stock are
capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This summary does not address foreign, state or local
tax consequences of the Merger, nor does it address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transactions to
special classes of taxpayers (e.g., stockholders that beneficially own (actually or constructively) more than 5% of the
total fair market value of the shares of Magellan common stock (except as specifically described below), small
business investment companies, S corporations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, qualified foreign pension funds or qualified
collective investment vehicles, persons that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, cooperatives,
banks and certain other financial institutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations,
governmental organizations, retirement plans, stockholders that are, or hold shares of Magellan common stock
through, partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, trusts, United States
persons whose functional currency is not the United States dollar, dealers in securities or foreign currency, traders
that mark-to-market their securities, expatriates and former long-term residents of the United States, stockholders
holding shares of Magellan common stock that are part of a straddle, hedging, constructive sale, conversion or other
integrated security transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, stockholders who properly exercise appraisal
rights with respect to their shares of Magellan common stock, stockholders who hold their shares of Magellan
common stock as “qualified small business stock” or “section 1244 stock,” and stockholders who received shares of
Magellan common stock in compensatory transactions (including pursuant to the exercise of employee stock
options, stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights, as restricted stock or otherwise as compensation). In
addition, this summary does not address U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (including any U.S. federal estate
or gift tax consequences), any aspect of the U.S. alternative minimum tax or Medicare tax on net investment income,
or any state, local or foreign tax consequence of the Merger.
This discussion does not address the tax consequences of acquisitions or dispositions of shares of Magellan
common stock outside the Merger, or transactions pertaining to options or other equity awards of the Company in
connection with the Merger.
For purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Magellan common stock
that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United
States; (ii) a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income
of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust, if (A) a United States court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more United States persons (within the
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions or (B) the
trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For
purposes of this summary, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Magellan common stock
(other than a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
that is not a U.S. Holder.
If a partnership, or another entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds
shares of the Magellan common stock, the tax treatment of its partners or members generally will depend upon the
status of the partner or member and the partnership’s activities. Accordingly, partnerships or other entities treated as
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes that hold shares of Magellan common stock, and partners or
members in those entities, are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the specific U.S. federal income tax
consequences to them of the Merger.
THIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO U.S. HOLDERS AND NON-U.S. HOLDERS. WE URGE U.S. HOLDERS, NON-U.S.
HOLDERS AND OTHER BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH
RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS
LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT AND OTHER NON-
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER APPLICABLE U.S. TAX TREATIES AND
STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders. The exchange of shares of Magellan common stock for cash pursuant to the
Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. Holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder
who receives cash in exchange for shares of Magellan common stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount
of cash received (determined before the deduction of withholding taxes, if any) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the shares of Magellan common stock surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss will be
determined separately for each block of shares of Magellan common stock (that is, shares of Magellan common stock
acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss
would be long-term capital gain or loss, provided that the holding period for such block of shares of Magellan
common stock is more than one year at the time of consummation of the Merger. Long-term capital gain recognized
by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The
deductibility of capital losses by a U.S. Holder is subject to certain limitations.
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders. Generally, the exchange of shares of Magellan common stock for cash
pursuant the Merger will not be a taxable transaction to Non-U.S. Holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
unless: (i) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the
taxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met; (ii) the gain is effectively connected with the Non-
U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States and, if required by an applicable tax treaty,
attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States; or (iii) the
Company is or has been a United States real property holding corporation, or “USRPHC,” for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at any time within the shorter of the Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period and the five-year period preceding
the Merger, the Non-U.S. Holder owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of the shares of
Magellan common stock at any time within such period, and certain other conditions are satisfied.
In the case of clause (i) of the preceding paragraph, gain generally will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 30% (or such
lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by certain U.S.-source
capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States).
In the case of clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, unless a tax treaty provides otherwise, gain will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax at the rates generally applicable to a U.S. Holder (and such Non-U.S. Holder should generally
provide an IRS Form W-8ECI). A Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation also may be subject to a 30% branch
profits tax (or applicable lower treaty rate) with respect to gain recognized under clause (ii). In the case of clause (iii),
Non-U.S. Holders that have actually or constructively owned more than 5% of the shares of Magellan common stock
should consult their tax advisors regarding the process for requesting documentation from the Company to establish
whether the Company is a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes and any consequences with respect thereto.
Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the particular U.S. federal, state, and local, or
foreign tax consequences the Merger and the effect of any applicable tax treaties.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. Information reporting and backup withholding (at a rate of 24%)
may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply
to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies under penalty of perjury that
such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a
Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification signed under penalty of perjury of such Non-U.S. Holder’s foreign
status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (b) otherwise establishes an
exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability,
provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
The tax discussion set forth above is included for general information only and is not tax advice. You are urged to
consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you of the Merger, including the
applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other tax laws and treaties.

The closing of the Merger is not conditioned upon Centene’s obtaining any financing.
In connection with the Merger, the parties intend to repay in full and terminate Magellan’s existing credit facility and
effect the release or termination of any liens and guarantees, and the return of any possessory collateral, in
connection with such repayment. In addition, Magellan will use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Centene an
executed waiver letter with respect to its continuing agreement for standby letters of credit that provides for the
waiver of the change of control under such agreement and other defaults or events of default triggered by the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
If requested by Centene, Magellan has agreed to cause its representatives to use its and their commercially
reasonable efforts to reasonably cooperate with Centene to, related to the Company’s 4.400% Senior Notes due 2024
and the related indentures, (i) commence any of (1) one or more offers to purchase any or all of the outstanding series
of such notes for cash or (2) one or more offers to exchange any or all of the outstanding notes for securities issued
by Centene or any of its subsidiaries and (ii) conduct consent solicitations to obtain from the requisite holders
thereof consent to certain amendments to such indentures. Centene has agreed to pay the costs of any such offers to

Under the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed unless certain waiting period
requirements have expired or been terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file a pre-merger
notification with the FTC and the DOJ. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the
expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification
forms or the early termination of that waiting period. If the FTC or DOJ issues a Request for Additional Information
and Documentary Material prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-
calendar-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the
request for additional information, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier. Under the Merger Agreement,
completion of the Merger is conditioned on the HSR Act Clearance.
On January 8, 2021, Magellan and Centene filed their respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with
respect to the Merger with the FTC and DOJ, which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. On February 8,
2021, the date on which the waiting period was to expire, Centene voluntarily withdrew its notification and report
form, as permitted by the HSR Act and the terms of the Merger Agreement. Centene refiled such form with the FTC
and the DOJ on February 10, 2021. Unless the FTC and DOJ grant early termination of the HSR Act review period
(subject to the FTC and DOJ’s lifting of the current suspension of review period early terminations) or the FTC or
DOJ formally requests additional information concerning the Merger, the waiting period will expire on March 12, 2021.
At any time before or after the Merger is completed, the FTC or DOJ could take action under U.S. federal antitrust
laws in opposition to the Merger, including seeking to enjoin completion of the Merger, condition adoption of the
Merger Agreement upon the divestiture of assets of Centene, Magellan or their respective subsidiaries or impose
restrictions on Centene’s post-Merger operations or other conditions. In addition, U.S. state attorneys general could
take such action under state antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including,
without limitation, seeking to enjoin completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory
concessions or conditions. Private parties also may seek to take legal action under the U.S. federal or state antitrust
laws under some circumstances.
For a description of Magellan’s and Centene’s respective obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to
regulatory approvals, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Change of Recommendation and Termination-
Efforts to Complete the Merger,” beginning on page 90.

Federal and State Regulatory Approvals
Pursuant to federal health care laws and regulations and, in some instances, the health care and insurance laws and
regulations of certain states, and pursuant to certain licenses of certain of Magellan’s subsidiaries, applicable federal

Magellan’s health maintenance organizations, insurance companies, pharmacy businesses and other regulated
businesses or entities, including the required consents on which completion of the Merger is conditioned under the
Merger Agreement. To obtain these approvals and provide such notices, Centene, or the applicable Centene
subsidiary, and in some instances Magellan, or the applicable Magellan regulated entity, as the case may be, has filed
and/or will file acquisition of control and/or material modification or other statements, notices or applications, as
required by federal health care law or regulation and the insurance, health care or other laws and regulations of each

Between February 10, 2021 and February 16, 2021, two complaints were filed in the United States District for the
District of Delaware by purported stockholders of Magellan: (i) Shiva Stein v. Magellan Health, Inc., et al., Case No.

al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00217-UNA (which we refer to as the “Waterman Complaint” and, together with the Stein
Complaint, the “Federal Court Actions”). Each of the Federal Court Actions names Magellan and the members of the
Board as defendants. The Federal Court Actions assert claims under Section 14(a), Rule 14a-9 and Section 20(a) of
the Exchange Act and allege that defendants omitted certain material facts related to the transaction from the
Schedule 14A filed by Magellan. The Federal Court Actions seek, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from
proceeding with, consummating or closing the transaction, rescissory damages should the transaction not be
enjoined and an award of attorneys’ and experts’ fees.

beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Centene,
Merger Sub, and the Company or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning
the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In
addition, you should not rely on the covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the
respective businesses of Centene, Merger Sub and the Company because the parties to the Merger Agreement may
take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure schedule to the Merger
Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice
to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A hereto, only to provide you with
information regarding its terms and conditions and not to provide any other factual information regarding Centene,
Merger Sub, and the Company or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the
information provided elsewhere in this document and in the filings that the Company has made or will make with the
SEC. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 107.
Structure of the Merger
The Merger Agreement provides, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub will be merged with and into Magellan and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease.
Magellan will be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Centene.
Merger Consideration Received by Magellan Stockholders
At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Magellan common stock (other than shares of Magellan common
stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Centene, Merger Sub or Magellan (including as treasury stock) (each
of which will be cancelled upon completion of the Merger), shares with respect to which appraisal rights are properly
exercised and not withdrawn and any shares of Magellan common stock underlying restricted stock awards of the
Company, other than those held by nonemployee members of the Board) will be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, which is the per-share consideration amount of $95.00 in cash, without interest.
Appraisal Shares
At the Effective Time, any shares of Magellan common stock held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, whether present via the virtual meeting webcast or represented by
proxy, or consented thereto in writing, and who are entitled to demand and have properly made a demand for
appraisal of their shares and have not failed to perfect or otherwise waived, withdrawn or lost the right to
77TABLE OF CONTENTS
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
will be automatically cancelled and the holders of such appraisal shares will only be entitled to have the fair value of
their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any holder
of appraisal shares fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such holder’s appraisal rights, then the
appraisal shares will be automatically converted, or deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into,
and will represent only, the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards; Company ESPP
The Merger Agreement provides that, as of the Effective Time:
•
each outstanding Company Option will be converted into an adjusted option with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
double-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the
Company’s retirement policy) and relating to the number of shares of Centene common stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock subject to such Company Option, multiplied
by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole
share. The exercise price per share of Centene common stock subject to any adjusted option will be an
amount equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Magellan common stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio,
with any fractional cents rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The exercise price per share of Centene
common stock subject to any adjusted option and the number of shares of Centene common stock subject
to any such adjusted option will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code, and, in the case of Company Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock

Company’s retirement policy, but excluding the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such
Company PSU which will not apply from and after the Effective Time) and relating to the number of shares
of Centene common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock
subject to such Company PSU based on the achievement of the applicable performance metrics at the
target level of performance, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares
rounded to the nearest whole share;

provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the Company’s retirement policy) and
relating to the number of shares of Centene common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Magellan common stock subject to such Company RSA, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange
Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share;
•
each outstanding Company Director RSA will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each share of Magellan common stock subject to such Company Director RSA,
payable as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) business days
after the Effective Time;
•
each outstanding Company RSU will be converted into a restricted stock unit with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
double-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the
Company’s retirement policy) and relating to the number of shares of Centene common stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Magellan common stock subject to such Company RSU, multiplied

by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share.
With respect to the Company ESPP, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company will take all
actions reasonably required to provide that (i) the Offering Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) in effect as of
the date of the Merger Agreement will be the final Offering Period and no further Offering Period will commence
pursuant to the Company ESPP after the date of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) each individual participating in the
final Offering Period will not be permitted to (1) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the Company
ESPP from the rate in effect when the final Offering Period commenced or (2) make separate non-payroll contributions
to the Company ESPP on or following the date of the Merger Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
take all reasonably necessary actions to (A) cause the final Offering Period, to the extent that it would otherwise be
outstanding at the Effective Time, to be terminated no later than five (5) business days prior to the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, (B) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the final Offering Period,
but otherwise treat the final Offering Period as a fully effective and completed Offering Period for all purposes
pursuant to the Company ESPP and (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than five (5) business days prior to the date
on which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the Company ESPP. On such
exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the Company ESPP within each
participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Magellan common stock in accordance
with the terms of the Company ESPP, and such shares of Magellan common stock will be entitled to the Merger
Consideration. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the
Merger), the Company will terminate the Company ESPP.
Financing Cooperation
The closing of the Merger is not conditioned upon Centene’s obtaining any financing.
The Company has agreed to, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to, use its and
their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Centene in connection with Centene’s arrangement of debt financing
in connection with the Merger or a refinancing of Centene’s debt, to the extent and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement.
In connection with the Merger, the parties intend to repay in full and terminate Magellan’s existing credit facility and
effect the release or termination of any liens and guarantees, and the return of any possessory collateral, in
connection with such repayment. In addition, Magellan will use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Centene an
executed waiver letter with respect to its continuing agreement for standby letters of credit that provides for the
waiver of the change of control under such agreement and other defaults or events of default triggered by the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
If requested by Centene, the Company has agreed to cause its representatives to use its and their commercially
reasonable efforts to reasonably cooperate with Centene to, related to the Company’s 4.400% Senior Notes due 2024
and the related indentures, (i) commence any of (1) one or more offers to purchase any or all of the outstanding series
of such notes for cash or (2) one or more offers to exchange any or all of the outstanding notes for securities issued
by Centene or any of its subsidiaries and (ii) conduct the consent solicitation to obtain from the requisite holders
thereof consent to certain amendments to such indentures. Centene has not yet determined what, if any, action it will
take with respect to the notes.
Closing
Unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Centene and the Company, the closing of the Merger will
occur electronically (including by email) by the exchange of required closing deliveries on the third business day
after satisfaction (or waiver to the extent legally permissible) of the closing conditions described below under “-
Conditions to the Merger” (except for any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Effective Time
The Merger will become effective at the time the certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such other time agreed upon by Centene and the Company and specified in the certificate
of merger.
Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates
The conversion of Converted Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will occur automatically at the
Effective Time. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Centene’s paying agent (which we refer to
as the “paying agent”) will mail a letter of transmittal to each holder of record of a certificate representing Converted
Shares. The letter of transmittal will be accompanied by instructions for surrendering such certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
After the Effective Time, shares of Magellan common stock will no longer be outstanding and will cease to exist, and
each certificate that previously represented Converted Shares will represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, as described above and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Any holder of book entry shares that are Converted Shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the paying agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of book entry shares whose shares of
Magellan common stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will automatically, upon
the Effective Time, be entitled to receive, and Centene will cause the paying agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration. The book entry shares of Magellan
common stock held by such holder will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
conversion of any book entry shares.
Centene, Magellan and the paying agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any person under the Merger Agreement any amounts required to be deducted and withheld from such
payment under applicable tax laws.

Termination of the Merger Agreement
The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written agreement of
Centene and Magellan. The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by either Centene or Magellan if:
•
the closing has not occurred by 5:00 p.m. on the outside date of October 4, 2021, except that, if, as of 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the outside date, all of the closing conditions described under “-Conditions to
the Merger” have been satisfied or duly waived by all parties entitled to the benefit thereof except for (i)
closing conditions regarding (a) the existence of a legal restraint that relates to the HSR Act Clearance or a
required consent, or (b) the HSR Act Clearance, required filings or required consents having been made or
obtained and (ii) any condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at the closing, the outside date will be
extended to January 4, 2022, except that a party may not terminate the Merger Agreement as described in
this bullet point if the failure of the closing to have occurred prior to 5:00 p.m. on the outside date (as it may
be extended) was proximately caused by such party’s breach of, or such party’s failure to perform or
comply with, in any material respect, any of its covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement;
•
any legal restraint is in effect that has become final and nonappealable, except that a party may not
terminate the Merger Agreement as described in this bullet point if the existence of such legal restraint was
proximately caused by such party’s breach of, or such party’s failure to perform or comply with, in any
material respect, any of its covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement; or
•
the Company stockholder approval is not obtained at the special meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement is taken.
Centene may also terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time if:
•
prior to receipt of the Company stockholder approval, the Board has made a change of recommendation as
described under the section entitled “-Change of Recommendation and Termination”;
•
the Company has committed a willful breach in any material respect of the no-solicitation provisions of the
Merger Agreement in connection with an alternative acquisition proposal and such willful breach cannot
be cured by the date of the special meeting or, if capable of being cured, is not cured within ten (10)
business days after Centene delivers written notice of such breach to the Company; or
•
the Company breaches, or fails to perform or comply with, any of its covenants or agreements under the
Merger Agreement, or any of the Company’s representations or warranties under the Merger Agreement
fails to be accurate, which failure (1) would give rise to the failure of a closing condition regarding the
accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties or the Company’s compliance with its
covenants and agreements and (2) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the Company or, if
reasonably capable of being cured by the Company, is not cured by the Company prior to the earlier of (a)
thirty (30) days after Centene delivers written notice of such failure to the Company and (b) the outside
date (as it may be extended as described above), except that Centene may not terminate the Merger
Agreement as described in this bullet point if Centene or Merger Sub breach, or fail to perform or comply
with, in any material respect their respective covenants under the Merger Agreement or their respective
representations or warranties fail to be accurate in any material respect, which failure proximately gave rise
to the failure of the closing conditions described herein.
The Company may also terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time if:
•
(i) the Board has authorized the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement in response to a superior
acquisition proposal in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the provisions
described under “-Covenants and Agreements-No Solicitation; -Change of Recommendation and
Termination” beginning on pages 87 and 89, (ii) Centene is not then entitled to terminate the Merger
Agreement under the second bullet set forth under Centene’s termination rights above and (iii)
concurrently with such termination, a written definitive agreement providing for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by such superior acquisition proposal is duly executed and delivered by the
Company, the person making such superior acquisition proposal and all other parties thereto,
82
TABLE OF CONTENTS
except that the Company may not terminate the Merger Agreement as described in this bullet point, and no
such purported termination will have any effect, unless the Company pays Centene the applicable
termination fee described below under “-Termination Fees”; or
•
either Centene or Merger Sub breaches, or fails to perform or comply with, any of its covenants or
agreements under the Merger Agreement, or any of Centene’s or Merger Sub’s respective representations
or warranties under the Merger Agreement fails to be accurate, which failure (1) would give rise to the
failure of a closing condition regarding the accuracy of Centene’s and Merger Sub’s representations and
warranties or Centene’s and Merger Sub’s compliance with their respective covenants and agreements and
(2) is not reasonably capable of being cured by Centene or Merger Sub or, if reasonably capable of being
cured by Centene or Merger Sub, is not cured by Centene or Merger Sub, as applicable, prior to the earlier
of (a) thirty (30) days after Company delivers written notice of such failure to Centene and (b) the outside
date (as it may be extended as described above), except that the Company may not terminate the Merger
Agreement as described in this bullet point if the Company breaches, or fails to perform or comply with, in
any material respect its covenants under the Merger Agreement or its representations or warranties fail to
be accurate in any material respect, which failure proximately gave rise to the failure of the closing
conditions described herein.
Effect of Termination
If the Merger Agreement is terminated as described in “-Termination of the Merger Agreement” above, the Merger
Agreement will be void and have no effect, and there will not be any liability or obligation on the part of any party,
except that:
•
no termination will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach;
•
no termination will affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Amended Confidentiality
Agreement, the Clean Room Agreement and the synergies clean team agreement between them; and
•
certain other provisions of the Merger Agreement, including provisions with respect to the allocation of
fees and expenses, including, if applicable, the termination fees described below, will survive such
termination.
Termination Fees
We refer to the fees described below as the termination fees.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company must pay Centene a termination
fee, Centene’s sole and exclusive remedy for any claims arising out of the Merger Agreement will be to receive
payment of such termination fee, together with any costs and expenses incurred by Centene in enforcing payment of
such termination fee. In no event will the Company be required to pay to Centene more than one termination fee.
The Merger Agreement provides that the Company will pay Centene a termination fee of $76,530,000 in cash in
connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement under the following circumstances:
•
prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, Centene terminates the Merger Agreement in
connection with the Board having made a change of recommendation as described under the section
entitled “-Change of Recommendation and Termination”;
•
the Company has committed a willful breach in any material respect of the no-solicitation provisions of the
Merger Agreement in connection with an alternative acquisition proposal and such willful breach cannot
be cured by the date of the special meeting or, if capable of being cured, is not cured within ten (10)
business days after Centene delivers written notice of such breach to the Company;
•
the Company stockholder approval is not obtained at the special meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement is taken and Centene
would have otherwise been entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of the matters in the
preceding bullet points; or
•
(1) the Company terminates the Merger Agreement in response to a superior acquisition proposal, (2)
Centene is not then entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement due to a willful breach of the
83
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company’s no-solicitation obligations described above and (3) concurrently with such termination, a
written definitive agreement providing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such
superior acquisition proposal is duly executed and delivered by the Company, the person making such
superior acquisition proposal and all other parties thereto.
The Company will pay to Centene a fee in cash equal to the termination fee if (1) Centene or the Company terminates
the Merger Agreement due to the Company’s failure to obtain the Company stockholder approval and, at the time of
such termination, Centene would not have been entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement in connection with a
Board change of recommendation or a willful breach of the Company’s no-solicitation obligations, (2) prior to such
termination, but after the date of the Merger Agreement, a bona fide alternative acquisition proposal is made to the
Company or the Board or is made publicly known and (3) within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination,
the Company enters into a definitive alternative acquisition agreement with respect to, or consummates, any
alternative acquisition for 50% or more the Company’s capital stock or assets (whether or not referred to in the
foregoing clause (2)).
Payment of the termination fee will not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Centene in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating the Merger Agreement and in reliance on the Merger Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.
Covenants and Agreements
Conduct of Business of the Company
The Company has agreed to certain covenants in the Merger Agreement restricting the conduct of its business
between the date of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger.
The Company has agreed that, except as required by the Merger Agreement or by applicable law or as consented to

material respects its business organization and goodwill, (ii) maintain in effect all material permits necessary

covenant described under the section entitled “-Efforts to Complete the Merger”, maintain existing

Without limiting the foregoing, nothing described in this section gives Centene the right to control or direct the
operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will exercise, consistent with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, complete
control and supervision of its operations.
Conduct of Business of Centene
Centene and its subsidiaries will not directly or indirectly (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), acquire,
purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license) any business, corporation, partnership,
association or other business or division or part thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, if doing so would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement from
occurring prior to the outside date (as it may be extended).
Stockholders Meeting
As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with applicable law and
the Company’s organizational documents, the Company is required to set a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of seeking the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Unless the Board has made a change of recommendation as described under the section entitled “- Change of
Recommendation and Termination,” the Company will recommend that its stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement,
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of such proposal and take all other
action necessary or advisable to obtain the Company stockholder approval.
No Solicitation
The Company has agreed to immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any person that may have been
ongoing prior to the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal, as described
hereinafter, and to terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such person or its
representatives. The Company has agreed that it will not, and will cause each of its representatives not to:
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing material non-
public information), or take any other action designed to lead to, the submission by any person of an
alternative acquisition proposal;
87
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
engage in, continue, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations related to any alternative acquisition proposal (other than to clarify the terms of Magellan’s
no-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement), or provide any material non-public information to
any person in connection with, or related to, any alternative acquisition proposal;
•
approve, endorse or recommend any alternative acquisition proposal;
•
enter into any contract (including any letter of intent, agreement, agreement in principle or memorandum of
understanding) or similar document or commitment related to an alternative acquisition proposal; or
•
release or permit the release of any person from, waive or permit the waiver of any right under, fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any consent or make any election under, any “standstill” or similar
provision of any confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party;
except that, until receipt of the Company stockholder approval, the Company will be permitted to waive any
such “standstill” or similar provision that prohibits a confidential proposal being made to the Board (or any
committee thereof), in each case, solely to the extent that the Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such waiver would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law and solely to the extent necessary to permit the person bound by
such “standstill” or similar provision to make a confidential alternative acquisition proposal to the Board.
Prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, if the Company receives a bona fide written alternative
acquisition proposal made after the date of the Merger Agreement that does not result from a breach of the
Company’s no-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, and if the Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor) that such alternative
acquisition proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior acquisition proposal:
•
the Company may enter into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such alternative
acquisition proposal that contains provisions not less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than
those contained in the Amended Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not contain a standstill provision to the extent Centene is, concurrently with entry by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries into such confidentiality agreement, released from any standstill
provision in its confidentiality agreement with Magellan) ;
•
the Company and its representatives may provide information (including nonpublic information) , and
access to the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ business, assets, books and records, contracts or employees,
in response to a request therefor by such person, subject to the confidentiality agreement described in the
immediately preceding bullet point; and
•
the Company and its representatives may engage in discussion or negotiations for such alternative
acquisition proposal with such person and its representatives.
The Company must promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) advise Centene in writing if it or any
of its representatives receives any (i) written or other bona fide inquiry, request for nonpublic information, discussion
or negotiation that is reasonably expected to lead to or that contemplates or relates to an alternative acquisition
proposal or (ii) alternative acquisition proposal or any proposal or offer that is reasonably expected to lead to an
alternative acquisition proposal. The Company must keep Centene reasonably informed (orally or in writing) on a
timely basis of the status and material details of any alternative acquisition proposal, request, inquiry, or offer,
including notifying the other party within 24 hours after the occurrence of any material amendment or modification
thereof. The Company must also notify Centene in writing within 24 hours of determining to provide information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an alternative acquisition proposal.
88
TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, alternative acquisition proposal means a bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer
from any person (other than Centene or one of its representatives and other than the Merger contemplated by the
Merger Agreement) or “group,” within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act, for, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, any:
•
acquisition of assets of the Company and its subsidiaries equal to 25% or more of the Company’s
consolidated assets or to which 25% or more of the Company’s revenues or net earnings on a consolidated
basis are attributable;
•
acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding Magellan common stock;
•
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person having beneficial
ownership of 25% or more of the outstanding Magellan common stock; or
•
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company that would result in any person or “group” having beneficial
ownership of 25% or more of the outstanding Magellan common stock or 25% or more of the voting power
of the surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity.
Change of Recommendation and Termination
Subject to the following paragraph, the Board may not change its recommendation that Magellan stockholders vote
“FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Under the Merger Agreement, a change in recommendation will occur
if the Board, or any committees thereof (i) changes, withholds, withdraws, qualifies, amends or modifies (or publicly
proposes to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify), in a manner adverse to Centene, its
recommendation, (ii) fails to include its recommendation in this proxy statement, (iii) adopts, approves or
recommends, or publicly proposes to adopt, approve or recommend, an alternative acquisition proposal, (iv) if an
alternative acquisition proposal is publicly announced or disclosed, fails to reaffirm its recommendation within 10
business days following Centene’s written request to do so or (v) makes any public recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer, except for a recommendation against such offer or a
“stop, look and listen” communication under Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. In addition, subject to the
provisions summarized above under “-No Solicitation”, neither the Board, nor any committees thereof, may cause or
permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries, to enter into any acquisition agreement, agreement and plan of merger
or similar definitive contract, or any other contract constituting, related to or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an alternative acquisition proposal or requiring the Company to abandon or terminate the Merger Agreement
or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, the Board may, make a change of recommendation in response
to the receipt of a written alternative acquisition proposal (with applicable thresholds in the definition of alternative
acquisition proposal equal to 75% instead of 25%) that was not solicited in violation of the no-solicitation obligations
described above, and that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
nationally recognized financial advisor) is reasonably capable of being consummated under its terms and is more
favorable from a financial point of view than the Merger to the Company stockholders taking into account all legal,
regulatory and financial aspects of such proposal, including conditionality, expected timing and likelihood of
consummation, the identity of the person making the proposal and any other factor the Board determines in good
faith to be relevant, which we refer to as a “superior acquisition proposal,” and the failure of the Board to make a
change of recommendation or to authorize termination of the Merger Agreement in response to such alternative
acquisition proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Prior to making any such
change in recommendation, the Board, must provide Centene with prior written notice of its intention to change its
recommendation or authorize termination of the Merger Agreement, which such notice must, among other things,
identify the person making such alternative acquisition proposal and provide a copy of such alternative acquisition
proposal agreement, or the latest draft thereof, and give Centene an opportunity to negotiate in good faith any
revisions to the Merger Agreement, which negotiation may be on a non-exclusive basis, during the five business day
period following the delivery of such notice, and take into account any changes to the terms of the Merger
Agreement proposed by Centene (in the event Centene has proposed any changes to the terms of the Merger
Agreement and there is a subsequent amendment to any material term of the alternative acquisition proposal, the
Board must deliver a new
89
TABLE OF CONTENTS
notice to the other party, and give Centene an opportunity to negotiate in good faith any further revisions to the
Merger Agreement during the two business day period following the delivery of such notice).
In addition, prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, the Board may, make a change of recommendation
in response to a material event, change, effect, development or occurrence, subject to certain exceptions, that was not
known to the Board prior to such party’s execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement (or, if known, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), which event or circumstance, or any
consequence thereof, becomes known by the Board after the Company’s execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement and before the receipt of the Company stockholder approval, which we refer to as an “intervening event,”
if the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized
financial advisor) that the failure to change its recommendation in response to such intervening event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Prior to making any such change in recommendation, the
Board must give Centene prior written notice that it intends to change its recommendation, which notice must
describe the facts relating to the intervening event, and give Centene an opportunity to negotiate in good faith any
revisions to the Merger Agreement during the five business day period following the delivery of such notice.
Efforts to Complete the Merger
Each of Centene and the Company has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to
cause the conditions to the Merger to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event no later
than the outside date, including making all filings to or with, and using reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents
of, governmental authorities that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger (including the HSR
Act Clearance, the required filings and required consents and certain other specified filings and consents pursuant to
the Merger Agreement). In addition, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents of (i)
persons other than governmental authorities and (ii) governmental authorities in their capacity as a customer (each of
which we refer to as a “third party”) that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger, except that
the Company will not be obligated to make, or commit or agree to make, any concession or payment to, or incur any
liability to, any such third party to obtain any such consent, and may not make any such concession or payment or
incur any such liability without Centene’s prior written consent or be required to make, or commit or agree to make,
any such concession or payment to, or incur any liability that is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing obligations of the Company to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents
from such third parties, the Company’s inability or failure to obtain any such consents, and any consequences to the
extent arising out of or related to such inability or failure, including the termination by any such third party of a
contract between such third party and the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the extent related to the Merger, will
in no event (1) be deemed a breach of, or failure to perform or comply with, a covenant or agreement for purposes of
the relevant condition to closing or (2) grant Centene any right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its
terms or fail to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the above, Centene has agreed to take or cause to be taken, do or cause to be
done, negotiate, commit to, suffer, agree to and effect any action, commitment, condition, contingency, contribution,
cost, donation, expense, liability, limitation, loss, obligation, payment, restriction, restraint, requirement, term or
undertaking (including any divestiture) to the extent necessary to (i) resolve any objection that a governmental
authority asserts (or threatens to assert) under any applicable law related to the Merger and (ii) avoid or eliminate any
impediment under any applicable law asserted by any such governmental authority related to the Merger, in each
case, to the extent necessary to cause the relevant closing conditions to be satisfied at least three (3) business days
prior to the outside date (which we collectively refer to as “regulatory concessions”). However, neither Centene nor
any of its affiliates are required to commence or defend any action against any governmental authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (other than administrative applications for
reconsideration or similar administrative appeals of adverse administrative determinations brought in administrative
forums related to the HSR Act Clearance or required consents or required filings). Further, Centene and its
subsidiaries are not required to take or cause to be taken, do or cause to be done, propose, negotiate, commit to,
suffer, agree to or effect any regulatory concession (including any divestiture) that, individually or in the aggregate
with all regulatory concessions, would or would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
business, assets, liabilities, financial condition
90
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or results of operations of (1) Centene and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (2) the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (3) Centene and its subsidiaries (including the Company and its subsidiaries), taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (which is referred to as the “combined
company”), except that (x) for purposes of each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (3), Centene and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and the combined company, respectively, will be deemed to be of the size, scope and scale, and with
the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition and results of operations, of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and (y) in determining whether any regulatory concession, individually or in the aggregate with all
other regulatory concessions, would or would reasonably be expected to result in such a material adverse effect
under each of the above clauses (1), (2) or (3), any adverse impact on the synergies reasonably expected to be
realized from the Merger will (without duplication) be taken into account (any such regulatory concession,
individually or in the aggregate, is referred to as a “burdensome condition”).
Notwithstanding the Company’s covenants and agreements summarized above with respect to efforts to consummate
the Merger, without Centene’s prior written consent, the Company will not and will not permit any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective representatives to take or cause to be taken, do or cause to be done, propose, negotiate,
commit to, suffer, agree to or effect any regulatory concession.
Employee Benefits Matters
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Centene agreed that each employee of the Company or their subsidiaries
who continues to remain employed with Centene, the surviving corporation or its subsidiaries (each of whom we refer
to as a “Continuing Employee”) will, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending one year
thereafter, be provided with (i) an annual base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than the annual base
salary or wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or their subsidiaries, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash incentive opportunities and target long-term incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee by the
Company or their subsidiaries, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) target long-term
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less than those granted by the Company in connection with the
most recent annual long-term incentive compensation grant cycle of the Company. Additionally, Centene agreed that,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending one year thereafter, each Continuing Employee will be
provided with employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company or
their subsidiaries, as applicable, to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Additionally,
Centene agreed that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending one year thereafter, each
Continuing Employee will be provided with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
provided by the Company or their subsidiaries, as applicable, to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Centene must provide that no pre-existing conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods will apply to Continuing Employees under the benefit plans provided for such employees except to
the extent such condition or exclusion was applicable to an individual Continuing Employee prior to the Effective
Time. With respect to the plan year during which the Continuing Employees begin participating in any Centene
welfare benefit plan, Centene further agreed to provide each Continuing Employee with credit for deductibles, co-
insurance, co-payments and out-of-pocket requirements paid during such plan year prior to the Continuing
Employee’s participation in such Centene welfare benefit plan. From and after the date of the closing, Centene further
agreed to provide credit to Continuing Employees for their service recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries
for all purposes to the same extent and for the same purposes as such service was credited under the Company
benefit plans.
Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance
For at least six years after the Effective Time, Centene has agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, any current or former officer, director or
employee of the Company against any out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with any actual or threatened action arising out
of or relating to (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or its
subsidiaries, (ii) any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time in such person’s
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time or (iii) the Merger, the Merger Agreement or the
91
TABLE OF CONTENTS
transactions contemplated thereby, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any applicable
indemnification agreement between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and such person and the Company’s
organizational documents in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement.
Further, for at least six years after the Effective Time, Centene has agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation or its
applicable subsidiaries to maintain in effect, for the benefit of any current or former officer, director or employee of the
Company or its subsidiaries, a level and scope of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage at least as
favorable as the level and scope thereof set forth in the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance program
in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, subject to an annual cap of 300% of the annual premium of the
Company’s current policy. If the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed the annual cap, the
Surviving Corporation will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to the annual cap. In
the alternative, the Company may, in consultation with Centene, obtain a prepaid “tail” policy prior to the Effective
Time that provides the current or former officers, directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries with
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for at least six years following the Effective Time; provided that the premium
payable for such “tail” policy will not exceed the annual cap.
Other Covenants and Agreements
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company and Centene made certain other covenants to and
agreements with each other regarding various other matters including:
•
actions to be taken by the Company with respect to notifying Centene of certain matters;
•
confidentiality and access by Centene to certain information about the Company during the period prior to
the Effective Time;
•
actions to be taken by the Company regarding the delisting of shares of Magellan common stock from

promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to otherwise use
reasonable best efforts to eliminate or minimize the effects of such anti-takeover laws on the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

This section describes the material terms of the Merger Support Agreement entered into and executed between
Centene, Merger Sub and the Starboard Parties on January 4, 2021. The description in this section and elsewhere in
this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Support Agreement, a
copy of which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger Support
Agreement. You are encouraged to read the Merger Support Agreement carefully and in its entirety.
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and as a condition to Centene’s willingness to enter into
the Merger Agreement, the Starboard Parties entered into a Merger Support Agreement with Centene and Merger
Sub. As of January 4, 2021, the Starboard Parties beneficially owned approximately 9.16% of the outstanding shares
of Magellan common stock.
The Starboard Parties have agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Support
Agreement, to vote their respective shares of Magellan common stock as follows:
(a)
in favor of the approval of the Merger;
(b)
in favor of any proposal to adjourn a meeting of the Company stockholders to solicit additional proxies in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
(c)
against any alternative acquisition proposal; and
(d)
against any other proposal, action or transaction that is intended to, or could reasonably be expected to,
materially impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage, or adversely affect the consummation of the
Merger or the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Merger Agreement or the Merger
Support Agreement , including against any proposal, action or transaction that could reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the consummation of the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement
not being satisfied, or that would result in a breach in any material respect of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement or the Merger Support
Agreement.
In addition, under the Merger Support Agreement, each Starboard Party has agreed not to transfer any shares of
common stock they beneficially own or may acquire until the earlier of the termination of the Merger Support
Agreement in accordance with its terms and the initial filing of the first definitive proxy statement in respect of a
Company stockholder meeting in respect of the Merger. The Starboard Parties have further agreed to use reasonable
best efforts to (i) cease and terminate all discussions and negotiations existing as of the date of the Merger
Agreement in connection with or in response to an actual or potential alternative acquisition proposal, (ii) not to
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage or take any action designed to lead to an alternative
acquisition proposal, (iii) not to propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company,
(iv) not to engage in, continue or knowingly facilitate or participate in any discussions or negotiations related to any
alternative acquisition proposal, (v) not to request from the Company access to material non-public information in
connection with or that would reasonably be likely to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal or (vi) not to adopt
or approve any memorandum of understanding, term sheet or any other agreement relating to any alternative
acquisition proposal.
The Merger Support Agreement with the Starboard Parties will terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the date on
which the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms; (ii) the Board makes a change in
recommendation (as defined above under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Change of
Recommendation”); (iii) the Company’s stockholders do not adopt the Merger Agreement at a stockholder meeting in
respect of the Merger; (iv) the date upon which the Merger becomes effective; (v) any change to the terms of the
Merger Agreement that materially impacts the amount or form of the Merger Consideration or otherwise materially
amends the Merger Agreement in a manner adverse to the Starboard Parties relative to the other stockholders of the
Company; or (vi) the mutual written consent of the parties to the Merger Support Agreement.

MAGELLAN HEALTH INC_20210219_DEFM14A_19054835_4126183.Pdf,APPRAISAL RIGHTS,"APPRAISAL RIGHTS
Record holders of Magellan common stock who comply with the procedures summarized below will be entitled to
appraisal rights if the Merger is completed. Under Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as “Section 262”),
holders of shares of Magellan common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly demanded and
perfected and not withdrawn or lost are entitled, in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration, to have the “fair
value” of their shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger) at the Effective Time judicially determined and paid to them in cash by complying with the provisions of
Section 262. Magellan is required to send a notice to that effect to each stockholder not less than 20 days prior to the
special meeting. This proxy statement constitutes that notice to the record holders of Magellan common stock.
The following is a brief summary of Section 262, which sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal
rights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of the applicable requirements, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E. If you
wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in
Annex E. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 may result in the loss of your
appraisal rights under the DGCL. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.
Stockholders of record who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must do all of the following: (i) not vote in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) deliver in the manner set forth below a written demand for appraisal of the
stockholder’s shares of Magellan common stock to the Secretary of Magellan before the vote on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement at the special meeting, (iii) continuously hold the shares of record from the date of making the
demand through completion of the Merger and (iv) otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262.
Only a holder of record of Magellan common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that
holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record. The demand should set
forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it appears on the certificates representing shares. If shares are
owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed
by the fiduciary. If shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,
the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent of two or
more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must
identify the record owner and expressly disclose that, in exercising the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the
record owner.
A record owner, such as a broker, who holds shares as a nominee for others may exercise appraisal rights with respect
to the shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which the holder is the record owner. In that
case, the written demand must set forth the number of shares covered by the demand. Where the number of shares is
not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares outstanding in the name of the record owner.
Beneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal rights should consult with the
record owner to determine the appropriate procedures for having the record holder make a demand for appraisal with
respect to the beneficial owner’s shares. Any holder of shares held in “street name” who desires appraisal rights with
respect to those shares must take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for
appraisal is made by the record owner of the shares.
Shares held through brokerage firms, banks and other financial institutions are frequently deposited with and held of
record in the name of a nominee of a central security depository, such as Cede & Co., The Depository Trust
Company’s nominee. A demand for appraisal with respect to such shares must be made by or on behalf of the
depository nominee and it must identify the depository nominee as the record owner. Any beneficial holder of shares
desiring appraisal rights with respect to such shares which are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other financial
institution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is made by the record holder.
As required by Section 262, a demand for appraisal must be in writing and must reasonably inform Magellan of the
identity of the record holder (which might be a nominee as described above) and of such holder’s intention to seek
appraisal of the holder’s shares.
97TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stockholders of record who elect to demand appraisal of their shares must mail or deliver their written demand to:
Magellan Health, Inc.
 
4801 E. Washington Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85034 
Attention: David Haddock, General Counsel and Secretary
The written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder’s name and mailing address. The written demand
must reasonably inform Magellan that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of his, her or its
shares. The written demand must be received by Magellan prior to the vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement at the special meeting. Neither voting (via the virtual meeting website or by proxy) against, abstaining
from voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will alone suffice to constitute a written
demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. In addition, the stockholder must not vote its shares of
Magellan common stock in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. An executed proxy that does not contain
voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and will cause the
stockholder’s right of appraisal to be lost. Therefore, a stockholder who desires to exercise appraisal rights should
either (x) refrain from executing and submitting the enclosed proxy card or (y) vote by proxy against the adoption of
the Merger Agreement or affirmatively register an abstention with respect thereto.
Within 120 days after completion of the Merger, but not thereafter, either the Surviving Corporation in the Merger or
any stockholder who has timely and properly demanded appraisal of such stockholder’s shares and who has
complied with the requirements of Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or any beneficial owner for
which a demand for appraisal has been properly made by the record holder, may commence an appraisal proceeding
by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of
a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of all stockholders who
have properly demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of Magellan as the Surviving Corporation
to file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the
Surviving Corporation will file such a petition or that the Surviving Corporation will initiate any negotiations with
respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should
initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262.
Within 120 days after completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with the applicable provisions of
Section 262 will be entitled, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), to receive from the
Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Magellan common stock not
voting in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the Surviving
Corporation and the number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares held in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from
the Surviving Corporation for the statement described in the previous sentence. Such statement must be given within
10 days after the request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a Magellan stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a
copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Magellan common stock and with
whom agreements as to the value of their shares of Magellan common stock have not been reached. After notice to
whom agreements as to the value of their shares of Magellan common stock have not been reached. After notice to
stockholders who have demanded appraisal, if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing upon the petition and determine those stockholders who have
complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may
require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of
the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. The Delaware Court of Chancery must dismiss an
appraisal proceeding as to all Magellan stockholders who assert appraisal
98
TABLE OF CONTENTS
rights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or
series eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of
shares seeking appraisal exceeds $1 million, or (iii) the Merger was approved pursuant to Section 253 or Section 267
of the DGCL. Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted, as to the shares of
Magellan common stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of
Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
After a hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which stockholders are entitled to
appraisal rights and thereafter will appraise the shares owned by those stockholders, determining the fair value of the
shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest to be paid, if any, upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in
its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in subsection (h) of Section 262,
interest from the date the Merger is completed through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded
quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharges) as established from
time to time during the period between the date the Merger is completed and the date of payment of the judgment. At
any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the combined company may pay to each former Magellan
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided in
Section 262 only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the
shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interests theretofore accrued, unless paid at that
time. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., et al., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that “proof of value by any techniques or methods
which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered in an appraisal proceeding and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors
involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair
value the court may consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise
and any other facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future
prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be determined “exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc.,
the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that
“elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the
date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined under
Section 262 could be more than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration they are entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they do not seek appraisal of their shares, and that opinions of investment
banking firms as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a transaction are not
opinions as to fair value under Section 262. Magellan reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that
for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Magellan common stock is less than the applicable Merger
Consideration.
The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the
parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include
attorneys’ and expert witness fees. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of the expenses
incurred by such stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to
appraisal. In the absence of such a determination of assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
From and after the date of completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in
compliance with Section 262 will not, after completion of the Merger, be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares
subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for
dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to completion of the Merger.
Within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give notice of the date that the Merger
became effective to each of Magellan’s stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal, who
99
TABLE OF CONTENTS
did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and who has otherwise complied with Section
262. At any time within 60 days after completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has demanded appraisal and
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the cash to which the stockholder is entitled
pursuant to the Merger. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal
only with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware
Court of Chancery within 120 days after completion of the Merger, stockholders’ rights to appraisal will cease and all
stockholders will be entitled only to receive the Merger Consideration as provided for in the Merger Agreement. No
petition timely filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding appraisal will be dismissed as to any stockholders
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and that approval may be conditioned upon such terms as
the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. However, the preceding sentence will not affect the right of any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined the proceeding as a named party to withdraw
such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after
completion of the Merger.
The foregoing is a brief summary of Section 262 that sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal
rights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement.
Failure to comply strictly with all the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to
consult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise your appraisal rights.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements
for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by
delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. As permitted by
the Exchange Act, only one copy of this proxy statement is being delivered to stockholders residing at the same
address, unless stockholders have notified Magellan of their desire to receive multiple copies of this proxy statement.
This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for
stockholders and cost savings for companies. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and
would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of this proxy statement and
wish to receive only one, please contact Magellan at the address below. Magellan will promptly deliver, upon oral or
written request, a separate copy of this proxy statement to any stockholder residing at an address to which only one
copy was mailed. Requests for additional copies should be directed to our Secretary at c/o Magellan Health, Inc.,

ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS
Section 1.1 Defined Terms. As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:
“Affiliate” means, as to any Person, any other Person which, directly or indirectly, Controls, or is Controlled by, or is
under common Control with, such Person.
“Beneficially Own” means, shares over which the entities listed on Exhibit A attached hereto have sole, direct record
and/or “beneficial ownership” for purposes of Rule 13d-3 or 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the date
hereof. Similar terms such as “Beneficial Ownership,” “Beneficial Owner” and “Beneficially Owned” have the
corresponding meanings. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be deemed to be the Beneficial Owner of any
Company Common Stock by virtue hereof or of the Merger Agreement and no party shall be deemed to be the
Beneficial Owner of any Company Common Stock as a result of the entry into any swap or any contract, transaction
or series of transactions that hedges or transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence
of ownership of such capital stock or interest in capital stock, whether any such swap, contract, transaction or series
of transactions is to be settled by delivery of Company securities, in cash or otherwise.
“Control” (including, with its correlative meanings) means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct
or cause the direction of management or policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of securities or
partnership interests or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise.
“Covered Company Shares” means, with respect to each Stockholder, (a) any Existing Shares Beneficially Owned by
such Stockholder and (b) any Company Common Stock of which such Stockholder has direct Beneficial Ownership
after the date hereof, in each case during Term (as defined below); provided, however, that Covered Company Shares
shall not include any Company securities that a Stockholder Transfers following the date of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 3.4.
“Lien” means any lien, claim, mortgage, encumbrance, pledge, deed of trust, security interest, equity or charge of any
kind.
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
“Transfer” means any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, gift, pledge, distribution, hypothecation or other
encumbrance or any other disposition, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, whether effected
directly or indirectly, or the entry into any contract or understanding with respect to any sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance, gift, pledge, distribution, hypothecation or other encumbrance or any other disposition, whether
voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, whether effected directly or indirectly, including, with respect to any
capital stock or interests in capital stock, the entry into any swap or any contract, transaction or series of
transactions that hedges or transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of
ownership of such capital stock or interest in capital stock, whether any such swap, contract, transaction or series of
transactions is to be settled by delivery of Company securities, in cash or otherwise (a “Derivative”) but specifically
excluding, with respect to any capital stock or interests in capital stock, any expiration of or roll forward of a
Derivative existing as of the date hereof. “Transfers” or “Transferred” shall each have a correlative meaning.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the disposition of any Covered Company Shares to the extent required as a
result of an investor’s termination of an account managed by a Stockholder shall not be deemed a Transfer for
purposes of this Agreement.
Section 1.2 Interpretations. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning given to it in the
Merger Agreement. Where a reference herein is made to a Section or Exhibit such reference will be to a Section of or
Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words “include,” “includes,” or “including” are
used herein they will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “hereof,” “herein,” and
“hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision hereof. The definitions contained herein are applicable to the singular as well as the plural
forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any contract,
instrument, or statute defined or referred to herein or in any contract or instrument that is referred to herein means
such contract, instrument, or statute as from time to time amended, modified, or supplemented, including, in the case
of contracts or instruments, by waiver or consent and, in the case of statutes, by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
Person are also to its permitted successors and permitted assigns. Where this Agreement states that a party “shall,”
“will” or “must” perform in some manner it means that the party is legally obligated to do so under this Agreement.
ARTICLE II
VOTING AGREEMENT
Section 2.1 Agreement to Vote.

material respect of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company pursuant to
the Merger Agreement or this Agreement.
(b) Any vote required to be cast or consent required to be executed pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall be cast
or executed in accordance with the applicable procedures relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted

the Company or the Stockholder) the amount or kind of the consideration to be paid and (ii) each Stockholder
shall retain at all times the right to vote (or execute consents or proxies with respect to) the Covered Company

the Company or its Subsidiaries shall not constitute a Representative of a Stockholder unless such Stockholder shall
have separately engaged or directed such Person in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder of the Company) not to
(and shall not authorize or give permission to its and their respective Representatives to), directly or indirectly (a)
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing material non-public
information), or take any other action designed to lead to, the submission by any Person of an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal, (b) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or divisions, (c) (i) engage in, continue, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations related to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or provide any material
non-public information to any Person in connection with, or related to, any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, or (ii)
request or seek from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any access to material non-public information, in each
case, in connection with or in response to, or that would be reasonably likely to lead to, an Alternative Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or indication of interest with respect thereto, or (d) adopt or approve, or enter into
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or any other agreement or instrument providing for or relating to any Alternative
Acquisition Proposal.
Section 3.2 Directors and Officers. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary but without
limiting any provision of the Merger Agreement, this Agreement shall apply to each Stockholder solely in such
Stockholder’s capacity as a holder of Covered Company Shares and/or other Company Common Stock and not in
such Stockholder’s or any partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of such Stockholder’s capacity as a director, officer
or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or in such Stockholder’s or any partner, officer, employee or
Affiliate of such Stockholder’s capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary but without limiting any provision of the Merger
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall (or require such Stockholder or any partner, officer, employee or Affiliate
of such Stockholder to attempt to) limit or restrict any actions or omissions of any such Person in his or her capacity
as a director and/or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or from fulfilling the duties and obligations of
such office, including in the exercise of his or her fiduciary duties as a director and/or officer of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, or in his or her capacity as a trustee or
B-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust or prevent or be construed to create any obligation on the part of any
director and/or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit
plan or trust from taking any action in his or her capacity as such director, officer, trustee and/or fiduciary. Without
limiting any provisions of the Merger Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall assert any claim that any
action taken by Peter A. Feld solely in his capacity as a director of the Company violates any provision of this
Agreement.
Section 3.3 Stock Dividends, Distributions, Etc.In the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or
distribution, or any change in Company Common Stock by reason of any recapitalization, combination,
reclassification, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the terms “Existing Shares” and “Covered Company
Shares” shall be deemed to refer to and include all such stock dividends and distributions and any Company
securities into which or for which any or all of such shares may be changed or exchanged or which are received in
such transaction.
Section 3.4 Lock-Up. Each Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that between the date hereof and the earlier of
(i) the termination hereof in accordance herewith and (ii) the initial filing of the first definitive proxy statement in
respect of any of the Company Stockholders Meeting or any other meeting of the Company Stockholders in respect
of the Merger, however called, such Stockholder will not Transfer any Covered Company Shares. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in connection with any Transfer not involving or relating to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal,
such Stockholder may Transfer any or all of its Covered Company Shares to any wholly owned subsidiary or Affiliate
of such Stockholder; provided, however, that in any such case, prior to and as a condition to the effectiveness of
such Transfer, each Person to which any of such Covered Company Shares or any interest in any of such Covered
Company Shares is Transferred shall have executed and delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a counterpart to this
Agreement pursuant to which such Person shall be bound by all of the terms and provisions hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Transfer of Covered Company Shares shall relieve any Stockholder of its obligations under
Section 2.1 so long as such Stockholder remains entitled to vote such Covered Company Shares thereon or consent
thereto, unless the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting or any other meeting of the Company
Stockholders in respect of the Merger, however called, shall have been set to a date on or after the date of such
Transfer.
Section 3.5 Public Statements. Subject to the last sentence of Section 4.2(b), each Stockholder shall not, and shall
cause its controlled Affiliates not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, make any press release, public announcement or other public communication with respect to
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby that disparages
Parent or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, trustees, employees
or partners, or is inconsistent with this Agreement in any respect, without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that such consent shall not be required
for any disclosure required by applicable Law.
Section 3.6 Disclosure. Each Stockholder hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in any
announcement or disclosure required by the SEC, Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange and, to the extent
required by applicable Laws, the Proxy Statement (including all documents and schedules filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection therewith) and any other required filings under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act or otherwise required by Law, its identity and ownership of the Covered Company Shares and
the nature of its commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement; provided, however, that
each Stockholder shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any such announcement or
disclosure required by the SEC.

(c) The execution and delivery by such Stockholder hereof do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not, (i) (1) result in any material violation of,

contract or agreement to which such Stockholder is a party or (2) result in the creation of any Liens upon any of
the properties or assets of such Stockholder, (ii) if applicable, conflict with or result in any material violation of
any provision of the Constituent Documents, in each case as amended or restated, of such Stockholder or (iii)
conflict with or materially violate any applicable Law, other than, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), any such
material violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not

of the Covered Company Shares, in each case, Beneficially Owned by such Stockholder as of the date hereof.

review pending or threatened by any Governmental Authority, (b) there are no Actions pending or threatened by or
before any Governmental Authority against such Stockholder or any of its properties or assets and (c) there are no
Orders of any Governmental Authority outstanding binding on such Stockholder or any of its respective properties
or assets, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on such Stockholder’s ability to perform and comply with its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement.
Section 4.5 Merger Agreement. Each Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent and Merger Sub are
entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon, and Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into the Merger
Agreement without, such Stockholder’s execution and delivery hereof.

preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights hereunder.

an original and all of which shall be one (1) and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart hereof by
facsimile or other electronic transmission (including email or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal
ESIGN Act of 2000, e.g., www.docusign.com) shall be effective as delivery of an original counterpart hereof.
Section 6.6 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (including the exhibit hereto) (a) is the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
related to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) is not intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies or
Liabilities on any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Section 6.7 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction hereof is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions hereof shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
Section 6.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, covenants or agreements
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such consent
B-7
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shall be null and void, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to any entity that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent. This Agreement shall be
binding on, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.
Section 6.9 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. This Agreement, and all Actions and causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in
equity), that may be based on this Agreement, arise out of this Agreement or relate hereto or to the Merger, the other
transactions contemplated hereby or the negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter hereof, shall be
governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed solely therein,
without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. For any Action or cause of action that may be based on this
Agreement, arise out of this Agreement or relate hereto or to the Merger, the other transactions contemplated hereby
or the negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter hereof, each Party (i) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to
the extent such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware or,
to the extent such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, (ii)
agrees that all such Actions and causes of action shall be heard and determined exclusively under the foregoing
clause (i), (iii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such Actions or cause of action in such courts, (iv)
waives any objection that any such court is an inconvenient forum or does not have jurisdiction over any Party and
(v) agrees that service of process upon such Party in any such Action or cause of action shall be effective if such
process is given as a notice under Section 6.4. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION THAT MAY BE BASED ON THIS AGREEMENT,
ARISE OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR RELATE HERETO OR TO THE MERGER, THE OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE OR
SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF.
Section 6.10 Remedies.
(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision
hereof was not performed under their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to the
termination hereof under Article V, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches hereof and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions hereof, without proof of
actual damages (and each Party waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
Parties further agree not to assert (i) that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason or (ii) that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach.
(b) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of a Party’s right to seek specific performance
pursuant to this Section 6.10 reduce, restrict or otherwise limit such Party’s right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 5.1 or pursue all applicable remedies at Law to the extent not limited hereby.
Section 6.11 Headings. Headings of the Articles and Sections hereof are for convenience of the Parties only and
shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.
Section 6.12 No Strict Construction. The Parties have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution hereof and, therefore, waive the application of any applicable Law, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in a Contract or other document shall be construed against the Party drafting such
Contract or document. Each Party has participated in the drafting and negotiation hereof. If an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the Parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions hereof.
Section 6.13 Exhibit. The Exhibit hereto is incorporated and made a part hereof and is an integral part hereof.
B-8
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 6.14 Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred by the Parties shall be borne solely by the Party that has
incurred such fees and expenses.
Section 6.15 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof may
only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as a Party and no former, current or future equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of any Party or any former, current or
future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent
or Affiliate (other than the Stockholders) of any of the foregoing (each, a “Non-Recourse Party”) shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of any Party against the other Parties, in no
event shall any Party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach
hereof against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party.

Board of Directors 
Magellan Health, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Centene
Corporation (“Centene”) and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
“Shares”), of Magellan Health, Inc. (the “Company”) of the $95.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 4, 2021 (the “Agreement”), by and among
Centene, Mayflower Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Centene, and the Company.
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,
sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for
various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities
they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time
purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,
currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Centene, any of their respective
affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the
Agreement (the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in
connection with the Transaction, all of which are contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the
Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may
arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the
Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may
receive, compensation. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the
Company, Centene and their respective affiliates for which our Investment Banking Division may receive
compensation.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to
stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five years ended December 31, 2019; certain
interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications
from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our
use by the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of
the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; compared certain financial
and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the Healthcare
industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed
with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we
have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet
assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse

analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement,
without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to
our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor
does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. We were not requested to solicit, and did not solicit,
interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company or any
other alternative transaction. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders
(other than Centene and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $95.00 in cash per Share to be paid to
such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any
other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the
fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature
of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of
such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $95.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the
holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not
expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time or, as to the potential effects of
volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or Centene or the Transaction, or as to the impact
of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Centene or the ability of the Company or Centene
to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we
assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or
events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the
information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the
Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote
with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $95.00 in cash per Share to
be paid to the holders (other than Centene and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a
financial point of view to such holders.

With respect to the information used in arriving at our opinion:
•
We have relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all industry,
business, financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information provided by or
discussed with Magellan Health (including, without limitation, the Magellan Health-Provided Information)
or obtained from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties.
•
We (i) do not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy, completeness,
reasonableness, achievability or independent verification of, and we have not independently verified, any
such information (including, without limitation, the Magellan Health-Provided Information), (ii) express no
view or opinion regarding the reasonableness or achievability of the Financial Projections, any other
estimates and any other forward-looking information provided by Magellan Health or the assumptions
upon which any of the foregoing are based and (iii) have relied upon the assurances of Magellan Health’s
senior management that they are unaware of any facts or circumstances that would make the Magellan
Health-Provided Information incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.
•
Specifically, with respect to (i) the Financial Projections utilized in our analyses, (a) we have been advised
by Magellan Health’s senior management, and we have assumed, that the Financial Projections have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Magellan
Health’s senior management as to the expected future performance of Magellan Health on a stand-alone
basis and (b) we have assumed that the Financial Projections have been reviewed by Magellan Health’s
Board of Directors with the understanding that such information will be used and relied upon by us in
connection with rendering our opinion and (ii) any financial projections/forecasts, any other estimates
and/or any other forward-looking information obtained by us from public sources, data suppliers and other
third parties, we have assumed that such information is reasonable and reliable.
During the course of our engagement, we were not asked by Magellan Health’s Board of Directors to, and we did not,
solicit indications of interest from any potential third-party transaction counterparties regarding a potential
extraordinary corporate transaction with or involving Magellan Health.
In arriving at our opinion, we have not performed or obtained any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(including any contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Magellan Health or any other
entity or the solvency or fair value of Magellan Health or any other entity, nor have we been furnished with any such
appraisals. We are not legal, regulatory, tax, consulting, accounting, appraisal or actuarial experts and nothing in our
opinion should be construed as constituting advice with respect to such matters; accordingly, we have relied on the
assessments of Magellan Health’s senior management and Magellan Health’s other professional advisors with
respect to such matters.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed that, in all respects meaningful to our analyses, (i) the final executed form
of the Agreement will not differ from the draft that we have reviewed, (ii) Magellan Health, Centene and Merger Sub
will comply with all terms and provisions of the Agreement and (iii) the representations and warranties of Magellan
Health, Centene and Merger Sub contained in the Agreement are true and correct and all conditions to the
obligations of each party to the Agreement to consummate the Merger will be satisfied without any waiver,
amendment or modification thereof. We also have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner
in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and in compliance with all applicable legal and other requirements,
without any delays, limitations, restrictions, conditions, divestiture or other requirements, waivers, amendments or
modifications (regulatory, tax-related or otherwise) that would have an effect on Magellan Health or the Merger in
any way meaningful to our analyses or opinion.
In rendering our opinion, we do not express any view or opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the Shares
or other securities or financial instruments of or relating to Magellan Health may trade or otherwise be transferable at
any time, including subsequent to the announcement or consummation of the Merger.

We have acted as a financial advisor to Magellan Health in connection with the Merger and will receive a customary
fee for such services upon successful consummation of the Merger. In addition, Magellan Health has agreed to
reimburse us for certain expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
As previously disclosed, aside from our current engagement by Magellan Health, we have not been previously
engaged during the past two years by Magellan Health, nor have we been previously engaged during the past two
years by Centene, to provide financial advisory or investment banking services for which we received fees. We may
seek to provide Magellan Health and Centene and their respective affiliates with financial advisory and investment
banking services unrelated to the Merger in the future, for which services we would expect to receive compensation.
We and our affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for our and their own
accounts and the accounts of customers, including but not limited to: asset, investment and wealth management;
insurance services; investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring; merchant
banking; fixed income and equity sales, trading and research; and derivatives, foreign exchange and futures. In the
ordinary course of these activities, we and our affiliates and related entities may (i) provide such financial services to
Magellan Health, Centene, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates, for which services we and
our affiliates and related entities may have received, and may in the future receive, compensation and (ii) directly and
indirectly hold long and short positions, trade and otherwise conduct such activities in or with respect to loans, debt
and equity securities and derivative products of or relating to Magellan Health, Centene, other participants in the
Transaction and their respective affiliates. Furthermore, we and our affiliates and related entities and our or their
respective directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents may have investments in Magellan Health, Centene,
other participants in the Transaction and their respective affiliates.
Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, we have adopted certain policies and procedures to
establish and maintain the independence of our research departments and personnel. As a result, our research
analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and publish research reports with respect
to Magellan Health, Centene, other participants in the Transaction and their respective affiliates and the Merger that
differ from the views of our investment banking personnel.
Our opinion has been provided to Magellan Health’s Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) for its information
and assistance in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Consideration. Our opinion may not be disclosed
publicly, made available to third parties or reproduced, disseminated, quoted from or referred to at any time, in whole
or in part, without our prior written consent; provided, however, that this letter may be included in its entirety in any
proxy statement to be distributed to the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger.
Our opinion and any materials provided in connection therewith do not constitute a recommendation to Magellan
Health’s Board of Directors with respect to the Merger, nor does our opinion or any summary of our underlying
analyses constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of Shares as to how to vote or act in connection with
the Merger or otherwise. Our opinion does not address Magellan Health’s underlying business or financial decision
to pursue or effect the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business or the
effects of any other transaction in which Magellan Health might engage. Our opinion addresses only the fairness,
from a financial point of view and as of the date hereof, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Shares. We do
not express any view or opinion as to (i) any other term, aspect or implication of (a) the Merger (including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Merger) or the Agreement or (b) any voting and support agreement or any
other agreement, transaction document or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or to be entered into or
amended in connection with the Merger or (ii) the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the Merger to, or of any
consideration to be paid to or received by, the holders of any class of securities (other than as expressly specified
herein), creditors or other constituencies of Magellan Health.

Furthermore, we do not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature
of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of Magellan Health’s directors, officers or employees, or
any class of such persons, in connection with the Merger relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise.
Our opinion has been authorized for issuance by our Fairness Opinion and Valuation Committee. Our opinion is
subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions contained herein and is necessarily based
on economic, business, capital markets and other conditions, and the information made available to us, as of the date
hereof. As Magellan Health is aware, global economic conditions and the global capital markets have been
experiencing and remain subject to significant volatility, and Guggenheim Securities expresses no view or opinion as
to any potential effects of such volatility on Magellan Health, Centene or the Merger. We assume no responsibility
for updating or revising our opinion based on facts, circumstances or events occurring after the date hereof.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Shares.

Financial Solutions, Inc. or another financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the “Paying Agent”).
(b) (i) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of cash
necessary to pay the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration under Section 2.1(a)(ii) (the “Payment Fund”).
If any Appraisal Share becomes a Subsequently Converted Share, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent,
for addition to the Payment Fund, the aggregate amount of cash into which such Subsequently Converted
Shares were converted into a right to receive under Section 2.1(a)(ii) and Section 2.3. The Parties intend that the
Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to the holders of Converted Shares and Subsequently
Converted Shares out of the Payment Fund under the paying agent agreement contemplated by Section 2.4(a).
Except as provided in Section 2.4(h), the Parties intend that the Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.
(c) Exchange Procedures.
(i) Certificates. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no
event more than four (4) Business Days) after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a Certificate
representing Converted Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the
Paying Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof under Section 2.4(g)) and shall be in customary form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Prior to such mailing, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the form of
such letter of transmittal and such instructions. Upon surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof under Section 2.4(g)), together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable, cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate, and such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name such
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by

reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax was paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate hereunder.
(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any holder of a Book-Entry
Share that is a Converted Share shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares
that are Converted Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, multiplied by the number of Converted Shares
previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.
(d) The Merger Consideration issued and paid under this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates that
represent Converted Shares (or, automatically, in the case of the Book-Entry Shares that are Converted Shares)
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares
of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Common
Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration provided to the Paying Agent under Section 2.4(b) to pay for any Subsequently
Converted Share shall be delivered to Parent promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) of
Parent’s demand to the Paying Agent therefor; provided that, in such case, until twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be
delivered for such Subsequently Converted Share.
(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person
for any cash from the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official under any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(g) In the event any Certificate representing Converted Shares has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation related to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as provided in this
Article II.
(h) The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided,
however, that no such investment income or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Company Common Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments (net of any
losses) shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and no part of
such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock;
provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in
commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or

banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Article II. If for any reason
(including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the
Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such
cash payment obligations.
(i) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person under this Agreement such amounts as required to be
deducted and withheld from such payment under applicable Law related to Taxes and Parent shall pay, or shall
cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the period
required by applicable Law. Any amount deducted or withheld under this Section 2.4(i) and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated as having been paid to the Person for which such deduction or
withholding was made. Other than with respect to any consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.6, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Company (or other applicable Person) advance notice of any anticipated
deduction or withholding and to cooperate with the Company to reduce or eliminate any amounts that would
otherwise be deducted or withheld.

of this Section 5.4;
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
nationally recognized financial advisor) that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Acquisition Proposal and the failure to make a Company Change of Recommendation or authorize the

Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
(iii) the Company Board provides to Parent a prior written notice that the Company Board intends to make
a Company Change of Recommendation or authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement under
Section 7.1(d)(i) (a “Company Recommendation Change Notice”) in response to such Alternative

such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, attach a copy of any Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any
proposed written definitive agreement, or the latest draft thereof, relating to such Alternative Acquisition
Proposal and summarize in reasonable detail any material terms and conditions of such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal that are not reflected in such copies;

hereof proposed by Parent in writing (provided that, if Parent has proposed any changes to the terms
hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby and there is any subsequent amendment to any material
term of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board shall provide a new Company
Recommendation Change Notice (including all required information and documents as set forth in Section
5.4(e)(iii)) and an additional two (2) Business Day period from the date of such notice shall apply), the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a nationally
recognized financial advisor) that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior
Acquisition Proposal and that the failure to make such a Company Change of Recommendation in response
to such Alternative Acquisition Proposal or authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement under
Section 7.1(d)(i) would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, at any time before the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Change of Recommendation if:
(i) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a

Company of, or failure of the Company to perform and comply with its obligations under, this Section 5.4.
Notwithstanding the Company’s obligations to cause its Representatives to take, or not to take, actions under
this Section 5.4, except for any Representative Breach, no breach of, or failure to perform or comply with, this

Intervening Event has occurred); and

Company Board has determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally
recognized financial advisor, in its good-faith judgment, taking into account all legal, regulatory and

of the proposal), the identity of the Person making the Alternative Acquisition Proposal and any other

definition of Alternative Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “75%.”

(b) Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that (i) the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a
“Change in Control” (or like term) under each Company Benefit Plan to which such term is relevant.
(c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits under any employee benefit plans of

paid time off and carryover paid health days accrued but unused through the Effective Time.

pursuant to this Section 7.3, shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
