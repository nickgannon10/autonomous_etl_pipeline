Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules governing “going-private” transactions,
including Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, the Purchaser Filing Persons are deemed to be “affiliates” of Myovant
and engaged in a “going-private” transaction, and therefore, may be required to disclose its purposes and reasons
for the Merger to Myovant’s “unaffiliated security holders” as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act.
The Purchaser Filing Persons are making the statements included in this section solely for the purpose of complying
with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. However, the Purchaser Filing Persons
are not making any recommendation to any Minority Shareholder as to how that shareholder should vote on any
proposal, and the views of each of the Purchaser Filing Persons should not be construed as a recommendation to any
Minority Shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote. The Purchaser Filing Persons have interests in the
Merger that are different from those of the Minority Shareholders.
For the Purchaser Filing Persons, the purpose of the Merger is to enable (i) Sumitovant to acquire 100%
ownership and control of Myovant in a transaction in which holders of Myovant common shares (other than
Myovant common shares held by (a) Dissenting Holders, (b) Sumitovant or (c) Myovant or its wholly owned
subsidiaries) immediately prior to the effective time will receive $27.00 per Myovant common share, and (ii) the
Purchaser Filing Persons to own 100% of the equity interests in Myovant after the Merger.
The Purchaser Filing Persons believe that after the Merger is consummated, Myovant should have greater
operating flexibility and more efficient access to capital, which should support Myovant’s long-term growth and
profitability. If that happens, the Purchaser Filing Persons (and not the Minority Shareholders) will benefit from any
resulting increase in the value of Myovant. Accordingly, the Purchaser Filing Persons have decided to undertake to
pursue the Merger at this time for the reasons described above, among others.
For a more complete discussion of the reasons of the Purchaser Filing Persons for the Merger, please see the
section entitled “Special Factors-Purposes and Reasons of the Purchaser Filing Persons for the Merger” beginning
on page 53.

The Purchaser Filing Persons believe that the Special Committee, which negotiated the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, including the Merger, with the
assistance of the independent financial advisor and legal counsel selected and retained by the Special Committee,
represented the interests of the Minority Shareholders. While the members of the Purchaser Filing Persons are
represented by the Sumitomo Directors on the Myovant Board, the Merger was negotiated and approved by the
Special Committee. The Sumitomo Directors are not members of the Special Committee and did not participate in the
deliberations of the Special Committee regarding, or receive advice from the Special Committee’s independent legal or
financial advisors as to, the substantive and procedural fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders. The
Sumitomo Directors, in their capacity as members of the Myovant Board, also recused themselves from
determinations related to a potential transaction with Sumitovant and SMP due to their affiliation with Sumitovant
and/or SMP. The Purchaser Filing Persons did not undertake, or engage a financial advisor to undertake, any
valuation or other independent analysis for the purpose of assessing the fairness of the Merger or the per share
merger consideration to the Minority Shareholders.
However, the Purchaser Filing Persons believe, based on the knowledge and analysis by the Purchaser Filing
Persons of available information regarding Myovant and the factors considered by, and the analysis and resulting
conclusions of, the Special Committee described in the section entitled “Special Factors-Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board; Fairness of the Merger” (which

control protections and/or (ii) severance protections upon a termination by Myovant other than for cause
or by the executive with good reason (as such terms are defined in the applicable agreement) (each such

Merger as a “change in control” (or similar term) of Myovant for purposes of determining severance
entitlements under Myovant’s benefit plans and employee agreements;
•
to the extent not paid prior to consummation of the Merger, Myovant’s executive officers will receive their
annual bonus payments on the regular annual bonus payment date (subject to such executive officer’s
continued employment through such regular annual bonus payment date), based on performance goals
established by Myovant at the beginning of the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2022”)
and accounting for partial attainment of performance goals consistent with historical practice (but not
discretionarily reduced for individual performance factors unless determined by Myovant’s Principal
Executive Officer and the compensation committee of the Myovant Board (the “Compensation
Committee”)); provided, however, that Myovant’s executive officers who incur a termination of
employment under circumstances that entitle the executive officer to severance prior to the regular payment
date of the annual bonus for Myovant’s fiscal year 2022 will receive prorated target annual bonus
payments, as provided by the Merger Agreement as soon as practicable following such date of
termination;

except as otherwise determined by Sumitovant and notified in writing to Myovant at least five business
days prior to the effective time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will be

transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “Special Factors-
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 76) who receives cash in the Merger will
generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received
and (2) such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Myovant common shares exchanged therefor. Subject to the
discussion in the section entitled “Special Factors-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger-
Consequences to U.S. Holders-Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations” beginning on page 77, such
gain or loss will generally constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
Holder’s holding period for the Myovant common shares exchanged is more than one year as of the completion of
the Merger. A non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “Special Factors-U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 76) will generally not recognize gain or loss under U.S. federal
income tax laws unless you have certain connections to the United States. You should consult your own tax advisors
regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the exchange of Myovant common shares for cash pursuant to
the Merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any federal, state, local or
foreign tax laws). For more information, please see the section entitled “Special Factors-U.S. Federal Income Tax

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Myovant agreed to be subject to certain customary non-solicitation
provisions, whereby, among other things, Myovant agreed not to, agreed to cause each of its subsidiaries and its
and their respective directors, officers and employees not to, and agreed to direct its and subsidiaries’ other
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
alternative acquisition proposal (it being understood and agreed that ministerial acts that are not otherwise
prohibited by the Merger Agreement (such as answering unsolicited phone calls and informing persons of the
provisions summarized in this section or contacting any person making an alternative acquisition proposal solely to
ascertain facts or clarify terms and conditions) will not be deemed to “solicit,” “encourage” or “facilitate” for
purposes of, or otherwise constitute a violation of, the non-solicitation provisions included in the Merger
Agreement). However, following the date of the Merger Agreement and until the receipt of the General Shareholder
Approval at the special general meeting, Myovant will be able to respond to and engage in discussions of certain
acquisition proposals, subject to certain conditions, if Myovant receives a bona fide written acquisition proposal that
did not arise from a breach in any material respect of Myovant’s obligations not to solicit acquisition proposals or
engage in discussions regarding acquisition proposals, and the Myovant Board (acting at the recommendation of the
Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that such alternative acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a superior proposal (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-No Solicitation; No Change in
Myovant Recommendation”).

Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
A:
On October 23, 2022, Myovant entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub with

Myovant common shares in connection with the solicitation of proxies in favor of the Merger Proposal, the
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. This proxy statement includes information that we are

A:
The special general meeting of shareholders will be held at 10:00 a.m., United Kingdom local time, on March 1,

Q:
Who can vote at the special general meeting?
A:
Only shareholders of record at the close of business on January 20, 2023, or the record date, will be entitled to
vote at the special general meeting. On the record date, there were 97,235,316 Myovant common shares issued
and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special general meeting.
Shareholder of Record
If, on the record date, your Myovant common shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer
agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, then you are a shareholder of record. As a shareholder
of record, you may vote at the special general meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the
special general meeting, we urge you to submit your proxy or voting instructions as soon as possible. For more
information, please see our response to the question “How do I vote?” below beginning on page 13.
Beneficial Owner Who Owns in Street Name
If, on the record date, your Myovant common shares were held, not in your name, but rather through a broker,
bank or other nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” and these proxy
materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your Myovant common
shares is considered to be the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the special general meeting. As a
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to vote the
shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the special general meeting, but in order to vote your
shares in person at the special general meeting you must obtain and submit a valid “legal proxy” from your
broker, bank or other nominee. In addition, if you hold your Myovant common shares in “street name” and you
submit voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your instructions
12TABLE OF CONTENTS
must be received by the broker, bank or other nominee prior to the deadline set forth in the information from
your broker, bank or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions. For more information, please see our

A:
On each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each Myovant common share you owned as of the
close of business on the record date.
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
How many votes are needed to approve each proposal?
A:
Merger Proposal 
The General Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval are both required to approve the
Merger Proposal. As a result of the voting standard for the Minority Shareholder Approval, if you fail to vote
(including if you do not submit a validly executed proxy or attend the special general meeting to vote your
Myovant common shares, or if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your
Myovant common shares) or if you abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal, the effect will be the same as a
vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. Pursuant to the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and consistent with the
Merger Agreement, Sumitovant has agreed to vote or cause to be voted all of the Myovant common shares that
it or its affiliates (other than Myovant and its subsidiaries) beneficially own in favor of the approval of the
Merger Proposal and all other proposals presented at the special general meeting. If Sumitovant votes in
compliance with the terms of the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, the General Shareholder Approval will be
obtained, but such vote will have no effect on the Minority Shareholder Approval.
Compensation Proposal
The Compensation Proposal requires approval by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
Myovant common shares entitled to vote on such matter and voting at the special general meeting. For the
Compensation Proposal, only votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” will be counted as a vote cast. If you fail to vote
(including if you do not submit a validly executed proxy or attend the special general meeting to vote your
Myovant common shares, or if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your
Myovant common shares) or if you abstain from voting on the Compensation Proposal, your Myovant common
shares will not be counted in determining, and will have no effect on, the outcome of such proposal.
Adjournment Proposal
The Adjournment Proposal requires approval by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
Myovant common shares present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on such matter at the special
general meeting. If you fail to vote (including if you do not submit a validly executed proxy or attend the special
general meeting to vote your Myovant common shares, or if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee how to vote your Myovant common shares), your Myovant common shares will not be counted in
determining, and will have no effect on, the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. If you abstain from voting on
the Adjournment Proposal, the effect will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
With respect to the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the Compensation Proposal, why am I being
asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve specified compensation that may become payable to the
named executive officers of Myovant in connection with the Merger?
A:
SEC rules require us to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to certain categories of compensation
that may be provided to named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What will happen if Myovant shareholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. This vote is an
advisory vote and will not be binding on Myovant. Therefore, if the Merger Proposal is approved by the General
Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval and the Merger is completed, the payments that
are the subject of the vote may become payable to the named executive officers regardless of the outcome of
such vote.
Q:
What is the quorum requirement?
A:
A quorum of shareholders is necessary to conduct business at the special general meeting. A quorum will be
present if holders of Myovant common shares representing a majority of the issued and outstanding Myovant
common shares entitled to vote at the special general meeting as of the record date are present or
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
represented by proxy at the special general meeting. Your Myovant common shares will be counted toward the
quorum only if you submit a validly executed proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or
other nominee) or if you vote at the special general meeting. Abstentions will be counted toward the quorum
requirement.
Q:
What if I do not vote?
A:
If you are a record holder and you sign and return your proxy card without indicating how to vote on any
particular proposal, the Myovant common shares represented by your proxy will be voted as recommended by
the Special Committee and the Myovant Board (acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee) with respect to that proposal. Unless a Myovant shareholder of record checks the box on his, her or
its proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the applicable proxy holders may use their discretion to vote
on other matters relating to the special general meeting, as applicable.
For purposes of the special general meeting, an abstention occurs when a Myovant shareholder of record
attends the special general meeting and does not vote or returns a proxy with an “abstain” instruction.
1)
Merger Proposal: As a result of the voting standard for the Minority Shareholder Approval, an
abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
2)
Compensation Proposal: An abstention will not count as a vote cast “FOR” or “AGAINST” such
proposal. If a Myovant shareholder is not present at the special general meeting and does not
respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for the Compensation Proposal (assuming a
quorum is present).
3)
Adjournment Proposal: An abstention will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the
Adjournment Proposal. If a Myovant shareholder is not present at the special general meeting and
does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for the Adjournment Proposal
(assuming a quorum is present).
Q:
If my shares are held in “street name” by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other
nominee vote my shares for me?
A:
No. In accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), banks, brokers and other
nominees who hold Myovant common shares in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary
authority to vote those shares with respect to the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, if banks, brokers or other nominees do not receive specific voting
instructions from the beneficial owners of those shares, they are not permitted to vote those shares with respect
to any of the proposals to be voted upon at the special general meeting. As a result, if you hold your Myovant
common shares in “street name” and you do not provide voting instructions, your Myovant common shares will
(i) not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special general meeting, (ii)
assuming a quorum is present, have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal with respect to
the Minority Shareholder Approval, and (iii) assuming a quorum is present, have no effect on the Merger
Proposal with respect to the General Shareholder Approval, the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal.
Q:
What will Myovant’s shareholders receive in the Merger?
A:
If the Merger is completed, holders of Myovant common shares (other than Myovant common shares held by (i)
Dissenting Holders, (ii) Sumitovant or (iii) Myovant or its wholly owned subsidiaries) will be entitled to receive
$27.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each Myovant common share they
hold immediately prior to the effective time, and any such Myovant common shares will cease to exist, and each
holder of such Myovant common shares will have no other rights with respect thereto as of the effective time.
Q:
What will holders of Myovant options, Myovant RSUs and Myovant PSUs receive in the Merger?
A:
Each option to purchase Myovant common shares granted under the Equity Plans that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, and that has an exercise
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
price per Myovant common share that is less than $27.00 will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment for each Myovant common share that is subject to such option equal to the difference
between $27.00 and the per share exercise price of such option (without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes). Each option to purchase Myovant common shares granted under the Equity Plans that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, and that has
an exercise price per Myovant common share that is equal to or greater than $27.00 will be cancelled without
payment. Each Myovant RSU, except for the Myovant RSUs granted to non-executive directors (other than Dr.
Nishinaka) described in the section entitled “Special Factors-Interests of Myovant’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units” beginning on page 70, that has not
been settled in Myovant common shares prior to the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive, in respect of each such Myovant RSU, a cash payment equal to $27.00 multiplied by the number of
Myovant common shares subject to such Myovant RSU immediately prior to the effective time (without interest
and less any applicable withholding taxes). Each Myovant PSU that has not been settled in Myovant common
shares prior to the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in respect of each such
Myovant PSU, a cash payment equal to $27.00 multiplied by the number of Myovant common shares subject to
each such Myovant PSU (deeming performance goals as being satisfied) immediately prior to the effective time
(without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes). Immediately following the effective time, there will
be no stock options to purchase Myovant common shares, Myovant RSUs or Myovant PSUs outstanding, and
the former holders thereof will only be entitled to receive the amounts set forth above.
Q:
How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of the Myovant common shares
prior to the announcement of the Merger?
A:
The per share merger consideration represents (i) a premium of approximately 50.3% to the closing price per
Myovant common share on September 30, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the public announcement of
Sumitovant’s initial non-binding proposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant

Q:
Why are the Special Committee and the Myovant Board proposing the Merger?
A:
The Special Committee and the Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors, who recused themselves),
acting at the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, have determined that the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting
Agreement are fair to and in the best interest of Myovant and its shareholders, and that the $27.00 per share
merger consideration constitutes fair value for each Myovant common share. To review the reasons for the
proposed Merger in greater detail, see “Special Factors-Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special
Committee and the Myovant Board; Fairness of the Merger” beginning on page 34.
Q:
How does the Special Committee and the Myovant Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Special Committee and the Myovant Board acting at the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee each recommends that our shareholders vote:
•
“FOR” the Merger Proposal;
•
“FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and
•
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
You should read the section entitled “Special Factors-Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special

of the factors that the Special Committee and the Myovant Board considered, respectively, in deciding to
recommend and adopt and approve the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and
the other the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and
the Sumitovant Voting Agreement. Please also see the section entitled “Special Factors-Interests of Myovant’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 69.
Q:
Do any of Myovant’s directors or executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or
in addition to, those of Myovant shareholders?
A:
Yes. Myovant’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or
in addition to, the interests of Myovant shareholders. See the section entitled “Special Factors-Interests of
Myovant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 69. The members of the Special
Committee and the Myovant Board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in
evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting
Agreement and in recommending that Myovant shareholders approve the Merger Proposal, the Compensation
Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
Will Sumitovant and its affiliates vote their shares in favor of the Merger Proposal at the special general
meeting?
A:
Yes. Pursuant to the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and consistent with the Merger Agreement, Sumitovant
agreed to vote or cause to be voted all of the Myovant common shares that it or its affiliates (other than
Myovant and its subsidiaries) beneficially own in favor of the Merger Proposal and each of the other
transactions and documents relating thereto of which approval of Myovant’s shareholders is solicited, in each
case, at any meeting of the Myovant shareholders held during the term of the Merger Agreement and at any
permitted adjournment or postponement thereto (which includes the special general meeting). The foregoing
voting obligations will terminate in the event that the Special Committee effects an adverse recommendation
change to its recommendation that Myovant’s shareholders vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. As of January
17, 2023, Sumitovant is the record or beneficial owner of approximately 50,041,181 Myovant common shares,
representing approximately 51.5% of the voting power of the Myovant common shares entitled to vote at the
special general meeting. For a discussion of Sumitovant’s obligation to vote all of the Myovant common shares
that it or its affiliates (other than Myovant and its subsidiaries) beneficially own in favor of the Merger Proposal,
please see the section entitled “Voting and Support Agreement” beginning on page 107.
Q:
What effects will the Merger have on Myovant common shares?
A:
The Myovant common shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act and are listed on the NYSE under
the symbol “MYOV.” If the Merger is consummated, Myovant will become a privately held company as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Sumitovant, and there will be no public market for the Myovant common shares. After the
Merger, the Myovant common shares will cease to be listed on the NYSE, and price quotations with respect to
sales of Myovant common shares in the public market will no longer be available. In addition, registration of the
Myovant common shares under the Exchange Act will be terminated.
For more information, please see the section entitled “Special Factors-Certain Effects of the Merger” beginning
on page 61.
Q:
Who will own Myovant after the Merger?
A:
After the Merger, Myovant will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitovant. Sumitovant is a wholly owned
subsidiary of SMP, and SMP and Sumitovant are affiliates of Sumitomo Chemical.
Q:
When will the Merger be consummated?
A:
The Merger will be consummated on the Closing Date, which will be no later than the seventh business day after
all of the conditions to the Merger are satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived, subject to
the receipt of the required approvals from Myovant shareholders and certain other closing

TABLE OF CONTENTS
conditions. However, Myovant cannot predict the actual date on which the Merger will be consummated, or
whether it will be consummated, because the Merger is subject to factors beyond Myovant’s control. See the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Merger” beginning on page 103.
Q:
What are the conditions to consummation of the Merger?
A:
In addition to approval of the Merger Proposal by Myovant shareholders, consummation of the Merger is
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of a number of other conditions.
See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Merger” beginning on page 103.
Q:
What will happen if the Merger is not consummated?
A:
If the Merger is not consummated for any reason, Myovant’s shareholders will not receive any payment for their
Myovant common shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, Myovant will remain a public company and
the Myovant common shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. Under certain specified
circumstances, Myovant will be required to pay Sumitovant the termination fee if the Merger Agreement is
terminated. For more information on the circumstances under which Myovant would be required to pay the
termination fee, please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Limited Expense
Reimbursement; Limitations on Liability” beginning on page 104.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Can I change or revoke my vote after submitting my proxy?
A:
Shareholder of Record
Yes. You can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before the polls close at the special general
meeting. If you are the record holder of your Myovant common shares, you may change your vote or revoke
your proxy in any one of the following ways:
•
You may properly submit a new proxy by Internet, telephone or mail. Please see our response to the
question “How do I vote?” beginning on page 13. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by
mailing a new proxy card to Myovant or by sending a written notice of revocation to Myovant, you should
ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be
received by Myovant two days before the special general meeting.
•
You may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Myovant Sciences Ltd., Attn: Corporate
Secretary, at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda.
•
You may attend and vote at the special general meeting. However, simply attending the special general
meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.
Unless you attend and vote at the special general meeting, your latest submitted proxy will be the one that is
counted.
Beneficial Owner Who Owns in Street Name
If your Myovant common shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the voting
instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee to change or revoke your vote. If you hold your
Myovant common shares in “street name” and you submit voting instructions to your broker, bank or other
nominee, your instructions must be received by the broker, bank or other nominee prior to the deadline set forth
in the information from your broker, bank or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, if you are a shareholder of record, you will be sent a letter of transmittal with
detailed written instructions for exchanging your Myovant common shares for the per share merger
consideration. If your Myovant common shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee,
you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take
to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the per share merger consideration. Do not
send in any certificate or evidence of ownership now.
Q:
What happens if I sell my Myovant common shares before completion of the Merger?
A:
If you sell your Myovant common shares, you will have transferred your right to receive the per share merger
consideration in the Merger. In order to receive the per share merger consideration, you must hold your
Myovant common shares through the effective time.
Q:
Will I have to pay taxes on the per share merger consideration I receive in exchange for my Myovant common
shares?
A:
The receipt of cash in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder of Myovant common shares who receives cash
in the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the
amount of cash received and (2) such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Myovant common shares
exchanged therefor. Such gain or loss will generally constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Myovant common shares exchanged is more than
one year as of the Closing Date. However, if we are, or, at any time prior to the Merger, were, a passive foreign
investment company, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the U.S. Holders could be different than
described in the prior sentence, as more fully described below in the section entitled “Special Factors-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 76. A non-U.S. Holder will generally not
recognize gain or loss under U.S. federal income tax laws
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
unless you have certain connections to the United States, as more fully described below in the section entitled
“Special Factors-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 76. You should
consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the exchange of Myovant
common shares for cash pursuant to the Merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the
application and effect of any federal, state, local or foreign tax laws).
Q:
If I do not favor the approval of the Merger Proposal, what are my appraisal rights under Bermuda law?
A:
If (i) you are a shareholder of record of Myovant as of the close of business on January 20, 2023, the record
date, (ii) you do not vote your Myovant common shares in favor of the Merger Proposal and (iii) you are not
satisfied that you have been offered fair value for your Myovant common shares, you will have the right under
Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act to apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for an appraisal of the
fair value of your shares within one month from the giving of notice convening the special general meeting. The
notice of the special general meeting accompanying this proxy statement constitutes such notice. The right to
make this demand is known as “appraisal rights.” Shareholders of Myovant who wish to exercise their appraisal
rights must: (i) not vote affirmatively in favor of the Merger Proposal and (ii) apply to the Supreme Court of
Bermuda to appraise the fair value of such holder’s Myovant common shares within the requisite one-month
period of the giving of the notice of the meeting at which the Merger Proposal will be voted upon. For additional
information regarding appraisal rights, please see the section entitled “Rights of Appraisal” beginning on page
122, as well as the complete text of the applicable sections of the Bermuda Companies Act attached to this proxy
statement as Annex D.
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
A:
If you receive more than one set of proxy materials, your Myovant common shares may be registered in more
than one name or in different accounts. Please follow the voting instructions on the proxy card or voting
instruction form in each set of proxy materials to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
Q:
How can I find out the results of the voting at the special general meeting?
A:
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the special general meeting. In addition, final voting results will
be published in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the SEC within four business days (as
determined pursuant to Form 8-K) after the special general meeting.
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
Myovant has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”), a proxy solicitation firm, to assist it in the
solicitation of proxies for the special general meeting and will pay Innisfree (i) a fee of approximately $30,000 and
(ii) in the event of significant shareholder opposition or in the event a third party publicly announces an offer to
acquire at least a majority of Myovant common shares, mutually agreed upon appropriate fees for such services,
depending on the circumstances, plus a success fee equal to 50% of all fees paid under clause (i) and (ii) if the
Required Shareholder Approval is obtained, as well as reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. In addition,
Myovant has agreed to indemnify Innisfree against certain liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of
its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions). Brokerage houses, nominees, fiduciaries and other
custodians will be requested to forward soliciting materials to beneficial owners and will be reimbursed for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in sending proxy materials to beneficial owners.

Myovant Sciences Ltd._20230123_DEFM14A_20573637_4573939.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
On October 31, 2019, SMP, Roivant Sciences Ltd. (“Roivant”), then the holder of 40,765,599 Myovant common
shares (approximately 45.5% of the outstanding Myovant common shares as of such date), and certain of their
affiliates entered into a definitive transaction agreement (the “Roivant Transaction Agreement”) governing a strategic
alliance (the “Strategic Alliance”) involving the acquisition by SMP of Roivant’s interests in certain pharmaceutical
companies, including the Myovant common shares owned by Roivant immediately prior to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Roivant Transaction Agreement (the “Roivant Closing”).
On December 27, 2019, pursuant to the Roivant Transaction Agreement, Roivant contributed to Sumitovant,
then a wholly owned subsidiary of Roivant, all of the Myovant common shares owned by Roivant (including an
additional 4,243,005 Myovant common shares (or approximately 4.7% of the outstanding Myovant common shares as
of such date)) (the “top up shares”) that were acquired by Roivant from a third party prior to the Roivant Closing to
ensure that SMP would indirectly own a majority of Myovant’s outstanding common shares upon the Roivant
Closing. Immediately following such contribution, Roivant transferred all of the outstanding equity interests of
Sumitovant to SMP. As a result of these transactions, SMP, through its ownership of Sumitovant, became the indirect
beneficial owner of a majority of the outstanding Myovant common shares.
In connection with SMP’s and Sumitovant’s acquisition of such Myovant common shares from Roivant, on
December 27, 2019:
•
Myovant and SMP entered into a $400 million unsecured revolving debt financing agreement with SMP as
the lender (the “Loan Agreement”);
•
Myovant, Sumitovant and SMP entered into the Investor Rights Agreement containing, among other
things, (i) protections for Myovant’s minority shareholders for so long as SMP and its controlled affiliates
(including Sumitovant) beneficially own 50% or more of the total number of votes entitled to be cast at
elections of Myovant’s directors and (ii) a right for SMP and its controlled affiliates (including Sumitovant)
to designate the three Sumitomo Directors to the Myovant Board, which directors are currently Myrtle
Potter, Adele Gulfo and Shigeyuki Nishinaka. The minority shareholder protections included in the Investor
Rights Agreement include a standstill provision (the “Standstill Provision”) prohibiting any member of the
Sumitomo Group from making a tender offer, exchange offer, merger proposal or other offer the effect of
which (if completed) would increase SMP’s beneficial ownership to over 60% of the outstanding voting
power of Myovant or acquiring all or substantially all of Myovant’s assets (an “Acquisition Transaction”)
unless such Acquisition Transaction is effected in accordance with specified requirements, including (i)
approval by a majority of the common shares held by shareholders other than SMP and its affiliates and (ii)
if the Acquisition Transaction occurs on or prior to December 27, 2022, approval by a majority of the
members then serving on the Audit Committee (each of whom is independent and not affiliated with SMP or
its affiliates); and
•
Roivant, Sumitovant and SMP entered into a share return agreement (the “Share Return Agreement”)
pursuant to which SMP agreed, among other things, to return to Roivant the number of top up shares that
would result in SMP beneficially owning in excess of 55% of the outstanding Myovant common shares,
with such beneficial ownership measured as of March 1 of each calendar year.
For additional information regarding the Loan Agreement, the Investor Rights Agreement and certain other
agreements between Myovant and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Sumitomo Group and its affiliates, on
the other hand, please see the section entitled “Other Important Information Regarding Myovant Sciences Ltd.-
Transactions Between Myovant and the Purchaser Filing Persons.”
23TABLE OF CONTENTS
From the Roivant Closing through September 28, 2021, Sumitovant acquired additional Myovant common shares
in the open market under a securities purchase plan entered into by Sumitovant on March 13, 2020, and a securities
purchase plan entered into by Sumitovant on May 14, 2021 (the “2021 10b5-1 Trading Plan”) in each case with
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (“CGMI”) pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.
Since the Roivant Closing, members of Myovant’s management team and representatives of Sumitovant have
met periodically to discuss Myovant’s business and operations, developments related to Myovant’s products and
other matters.
In addition, Myovant’s management and the Myovant Board, including the Sumitomo Directors, have regularly
reviewed and assessed strategic opportunities and alternatives and Myovant’s operations, performance, prospects
and strategy in light of current and anticipated business and economic conditions, as well as developments in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, with a view towards enhancing shareholder value. Such opportunities
and alternatives include, among other things, remaining as a stand-alone entity, potential acquisitions of other
companies or businesses in the industry in which Myovant operates, joint ventures and other strategic alliances and
other transactions. Separately, SMP and Sumitovant, as beneficial owners of a majority of the outstanding Myovant
common shares, reviewed their investment in Myovant on a continuing basis based on various factors, including,
without limitation, the contractual restrictions in the Investor Rights Agreement (including the Standstill Provision),
Myovant’s financial position, results of operations, conditions in the securities market and general economic and
industry conditions.
On April 8, 2020, Myovant, Myovant Sciences, Inc. and Sumitovant entered into a Nondisclosure and Common
Interest Agreement (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, in accordance with its terms, the
“Nondisclosure and Common Interest Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to share certain
confidential information.
On May 18, 2020, Myovant and Sumitovant entered into a consulting agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”),
which was amended on November 9, 2020, pursuant to which Sumitovant agreed to provide consulting services to
Myovant to support Myovant in commercial planning, commercial launch activities and implementation. The term of
the Consulting Agreement expired on March 31, 2021.
On February 2, 2022, Sumitovant, Myovant, Myovant Sciences GmbH and Myovant Sciences, Inc. entered into
a Services and Information Sharing Agreement (the “Information Sharing Agreement”), pursuant to which, among
other things, Myovant agreed, for so long as Sumitovant, together with its affiliates, is a majority owner of Myovant,
to supply certain information summarizing material aspects of Myovant’s business to Sumitovant, and with
reasonable advanced notice, give Sumitovant and its representatives the reasonable opportunity to discuss such
information with Myovant’s senior management. For additional information regarding the Information Sharing
Agreement, please see section entitled “Other Important Information Regarding Myovant Sciences Ltd.-Transactions
Between Myovant and the Purchaser Filing Persons.”
On April 4, 2022, Sumitovant and SMP submitted a letter to the Audit Committee requesting access to conduct
due diligence on Myovant’s business in connection with Sumitovant’s and SMP’s evaluation of the possibility of
submitting a proposal to acquire the remaining common shares of Myovant that Sumitovant did not already own, and
stating that it had retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”) as its financial advisor and Sullivan &
Cromwell LLP (“Sullivan & Cromwell”) as its counsel. In the letter, Sumitovant and SMP also noted that if they
determined to make a proposal, such proposal and any possible transaction following such proposal would comply
with the requirements set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement, including that the proposal would be subject to the
affirmative approval by a majority of the independent directors comprising the Audit Committee and a non-waivable
condition requiring the approval of Myovant shareholders holding a majority of the Myovant common shares not
owned by Sumitovant.
On April 6, 2022, Sumitovant and SMP provided the Audit Committee with a list of high priority requests for
materials and information, and also requested that Myovant grant Sumitovant and its affiliates and advisors
permission to use previously provided information in connection with their due diligence review.
Also on April 6, 2022, Myovant and Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) received a deficiencies letter from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (the “FDA”) regarding their supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) for MYFEMBREE®,
for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in pre-menopausal women.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On April 15, 2022, the Audit Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant’s
management and representatives of Cooley LLP (“Cooley”), counsel to Myovant, in attendance, to discuss the
requests received from Sumitovant and SMP and the appropriate response. Following this discussion, the Audit
Committee authorized Mark Guinan, Chairman of the Audit Committee, to contact Myrtle Potter, in her capacity as
Chief Executive Officer of Sumitovant, to discuss narrowing the scope of Sumitovant’s and SMP’s requests, in an
effort to minimize the diversion of management time and attention that would need to be devoted to the diligence
process prior to receiving a potential proposal and preliminary indication of value for Myovant from Sumitovant and
SMP.
On April 18, 2022, as authorized by the Audit Committee, Mr. Guinan spoke with Ms. Potter regarding the list of
high priority diligence requests that Sumitovant and SMP had provided on April 6. Mr. Guinan communicated that the
members of the Audit Committee had not made a determination about whether it was an opportune time for Myovant
to consider strategic alternatives such as a possible transaction with Sumitovant and SMP and, accordingly, wished
to limit the amount of Myovant management’s time and attention that would potentially be devoted to the diligence
process prior to receiving a preliminary indication of value for Myovant, noting that Sumitovant already had
significant knowledge about Myovant through its information and access rights pursuant to the Information Sharing
Agreement and designees serving on the Myovant Board. Ms. Potter indicated the items requested by Sumitovant
and SMP were necessary to evaluate whether they would pursue a possible transaction with Myovant, but expressed
a willingness to narrow the scope of the requests at that stage. Ms. Potter also indicated that Sumitovant and SMP
were not in a position to provide a preliminary indication of value with respect to a possible transaction until
Sumitovant progressed its diligence.
On April 20, 2022, the Audit Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant’s
management and representatives of Cooley and Conyers Dill and Pearman Limited (“Conyers”), Bermuda counsel to
Myovant. At the meeting, Mr. Guinan updated the other members of the Audit Committee on his discussion with Ms.
Potter on April 18 regarding Sumitovant’s list of high priority diligence requests. Conyers reviewed directors’ duties
under Bermuda law. The members of the Audit Committee also discussed the engagement of a financial advisor to
provide advice with respect to matters relating to a possible transaction with Sumitovant and SMP. Following
discussion of these matters, based on, among other things, Goldman Sachs’ qualifications, experience and reputation,
the Audit Committee authorized management to seek a proposal from Goldman Sachs to serve as financial advisor to
the independent directors serving on the Audit Committee and to obtain relationship disclosure from Goldman Sachs
with respect to Sumitovant and SMP to be presented to the Audit Committee.
On April 28, 2022, the Myovant Board held a meeting by teleconference, with members of Myovant’s
management in attendance to, among other things, consider the formation of a special committee consisting of the
three independent directors serving on the Audit Committee to oversee matters relating to a possible proposal from
Sumitovant and SMP. Following discussion, the Myovant Board (a) approved the formation of the Special Committee,
consisting of Mr. Guinan, Terrie Curran and Nancy Valente, M.D. (the three independent directors serving on the
Audit Committee), with Mr. Guinan serving as the Chairman of the Special Committee, and (b) empowered the Special
Committee to (i) review and evaluate any proposal from Sumitovant or its affiliates in order to make a recommendation
to the Myovant Board regarding whether Myovant should seek to engage in a potential transaction with Sumitovant,
(ii) if determined that Myovant should seek to engage in a potential transaction with Sumitovant, develop and
negotiate the terms and make a recommendation to the full Myovant Board regarding whether Myovant should enter
into such potential transaction, (iii) identify, review and evaluate available alternatives to a potential transaction with
Sumitovant, including remaining a separate company, and (iv) recommend to the Myovant Board what further
actions, if any, should be taken with respect to a potential transaction with Sumitovant or any alternative thereto. The
resolutions of the Myovant Board authorizing the formation of the Special Committee provided that the Myovant
Board would not recommend, authorize or approve any transaction with Sumitovant unless the Special Committee
recommended such transaction.
Immediately following the board meeting on April 28, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by
videoconference, with members of Myovant’s management and representatives of Cooley in attendance. The Special
Committee discussed the engagement of a financial advisor and counsel for the Special Committee. Following
discussion (including review of the proposed forms of engagement letters with such advisors and disclosures
regarding any potential conflicts of interest such advisors may have with respect to a potential transaction involving
Sumitovant), the Special Committee determined such advisors were not disqualified from
25
TABLE OF CONTENTS
being engaged by the Special Committee by virtue of any potential conflicts of interest with respect to a potential
transaction with Sumitovant and SMP and approved the engagement of Goldman Sachs, Cooley and Conyers. The
Special Committee also discussed the list of high priority diligence requests received from Sumitovant and SMP, and
reviewed the feedback that had already been provided to Sumitovant by Mr. Guinan prior to the meeting as well as a
proposed response letter from the Special Committee to Sumitovant regarding the diligence requests. Following such
discussion, the Special Committee approved the proposed response letter and authorized Mr. Guinan to deliver an
executed copy of the letter to Sumitovant on behalf of the Special Committee.
On April 29, 2022, the Special Committee and Myovant executed an engagement letter for Goldman Sachs to
serve as financial advisor to the Special Committee. The Special Committee’s decision to engage Goldman Sachs was
based on, among other things, Goldman Sachs’ qualifications, experience and reputation, including Goldman Sachs’
extensive experience in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and the Special Committee’s determination,
based on disclosures provided by Goldman Sachs on April 23, 2022 with respect to any material relationships with
either Sumitovant or SMP, that Goldman Sachs did not have any material conflicts.
On April 29, 2022, Sumitovant and SMP provided the Special Committee with a revised list of high priority
requests for materials and information it sought as part of its due diligence process and evaluation of whether to
pursue a potential proposal to acquire the remaining shares of Myovant that Sumitovant did not already own.
On May 5, 2022, the Audit Committee held a meeting, after which the members of the Special Committee (whose
members are identical to those of the Audit Committee) discussed the status of the high priority diligence requests
and a potential response.
On May 21, 2022, Mr. Guinan, on behalf of the Special Committee, sent a letter to Yuichiro Haruyama, then-
current Chief Financial Officer of Sumitovant, in response to Sumitovant’s letters provided on April 4, 2022 and April
6, 2022, regarding the possibility of Sumitovant and SMP submitting a potential acquisition proposal and related
diligence requests. The letter informed Sumitovant that after carefully considering Sumitovant’s requests, it was not
clear to the Special Committee that it was an opportune time for Myovant to consider strategic alternatives such as a
potential transaction with Sumitovant and, accordingly, that the Special Committee wished to limit the amount of
Myovant management’s time and attention that would potentially be devoted to the diligence process, including
because Sumitovant already had significant knowledge about Myovant. The letter also stated that the Special
Committee had no desire to hinder Sumitovant’s consideration of a possible proposal and was therefore willing to
respond to a subset of the information requests provided by Sumitovant. The responses to that subset of the
information requests were provided to Sumitovant along with the letter, and the Special Committee further authorized
management to provide additional due diligence information to Sumitovant and SMP. The letter also noted that the
Special Committee was permitting Sumitovant and its affiliates and advisors to use information previously provided
to Sumitovant for purposes of conducting due diligence on Myovant’s business in connection with Sumitovant’s
and SMP’s ongoing review of whether to pursue a possible transaction.
Following Mr. Guinan’s May 21 letter, between May 21, 2022 and the execution of the Merger Agreement on
October 23, 2022, Myovant’s management provided due diligence information to Sumitovant and its advisors at the
direction of the Special Committee as part of an ongoing process.
On June 28, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant’s
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”) in
attendance. Prior to representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden joining the meeting, the Special Committee
determined to retain Skadden to serve as counsel to the Special Committee, based on, among other things, Skadden’s
qualifications, experience and reputation and the absence of conflicts on the part of Skadden. While the Special
Committee did not believe that Cooley was disqualified from acting as its legal counsel by virtue of any potential
conflicts of interest related to Cooley’s prior or ongoing representation of Myovant, the Special Committee
determined to retain Skadden as legal counsel for the potential transaction with Sumitovant and SMP based on
Skadden’s qualifications, experience and reputation in providing legal advice in connection with situations involving
the type of transaction that Sumitovant and SMP indicated they were considering. Representatives of Goldman Sachs
and Myovant’s management reviewed information provided to Sumitovant as part of its ongoing due diligence
process. Myovant’s management also reviewed preliminary
26
TABLE OF CONTENTS
illustrative financial projections for Myovant that were prepared by management at the request of the Special
Committee (the “Initial Projections”), based on the original preliminary five-year projections that had been presented
by management to the Myovant Board earlier in the year as part of Myovant’s regular long-range planning process,
and key assumptions underlying those projections. The Initial Projections assumed, among other things, FDA
approval of Myovant’s and Pfizer’s sNDA for MYFEMBREE® for use in the treatment of endometriosis in pre-
menopausal women.
On July 7, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant’s
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. The Special Committee discussed
the Initial Projections prepared by Myovant’s management that were previously presented by Goldman Sachs to the
Special Committee on June 28 and the assumptions underlying those projections, and provided feedback to
management regarding the Initial Projections and underlying assumptions.
On July 26, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant’s
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Skadden and Cooley in attendance. Representatives of Goldman
Sachs provided an update on the information provided to Sumitovant in connection with its ongoing due diligence
process, and informed the Special Committee that J.P. Morgan, at the direction of Sumitovant and SMP, had advised
them that if Sumitovant and SMP were to proceed to make a proposal they would only do so after Myovant and Pfizer
received a decision from the FDA regarding their sNDA for MYFEMBREE® for use in the treatment of endometriosis
in pre-menopausal women. Myovant’s management and representatives of Cooley reviewed information to assist the
Special Committee in evaluating the loss of patent exclusivity assumptions used in the Initial Projections.
Management and the advisors reviewed the underlying assumptions used in the Initial Projections prepared by
Myovant’s management, including with respect to the assumed exclusivity periods associated with Myovant’s
patent portfolio. After discussion, the Special Committee provided feedback to management and Goldman Sachs
regarding potential revisions to such underlying assumptions.
On August 2, 2022, Mr. Guinan, on behalf of the Special Committee, circulated to Myovant’s senior management
a memorandum regarding certain guidelines for management in connection with the potential receipt of a proposal
from Sumitovant and SMP, including guidelines with respect to the confidentiality of the Special Committee process
and any interactions between Myovant’s senior management and Sumitovant and/or SMP in connection with a
possible transaction. Thereafter, senior management acknowledged that they would comply with the guidelines set
forth in the memorandum.
On August 3, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant’s
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of management and
Goldman Sachs reviewed management’s revised preliminary illustrative financial projections, which had been updated
to reflect revisions made following the July 7, 2022 and July 26, 2022 meetings and did not change thereafter (the
“Revised Projections”) and the underlying assumptions, and representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed preliminary
illustrative financial analyses based on such projections, including certain sensitivity analyses. The Revised
Projections assumed, among other things, FDA approval of Myovant’s and Pfizer’s sNDA for MYFEMBREE® for use
in the treatment of endometriosis in pre-menopausal women.
On August 5, 2022, Myovant and Pfizer publicly announced receipt of FDA approval of Myovant’s and Pfizer’s
sNDA for MYFEMBREE® for use in the treatment of endometriosis in pre-menopausal women.
On August 12, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Skadden in attendance. The Special Committee discussed the Revised Projections prepared by Myovant’s
management and the preliminary illustrative financial analyses, including sensitivity analyses, performed by Goldman
Sachs.
On August 22, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs updated the Special Committee on
communications with representatives of J.P. Morgan regarding Sumitovant’s evaluation of whether to pursue a
possible transaction, including with respect to due diligence information. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also
reviewed the Revised Projections as well as certain sensitivity analyses prepared by Goldman Sachs as requested by
the Special Committee at the August 12 meeting, and recent changes in market conditions and the trading price of
Myovant common shares. The Special Committee instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to use the Revised
Projections prepared by Myovant’s management in Goldman Sachs’ analyses. Representatives of Skadden reviewed
legal matters, including an overview of certain terms typically included in merger agreements
27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
involving a minority buyout of a public company by a majority shareholder. The Special Committee also discussed
with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden the possibility of conducting outreach to potential third parties
other than Sumitovant in advance of receiving a proposal from Sumitovant, during which discussion the Special
Committee considered, among other things, the risk that Sumitovant and SMP would be unwilling to support a sale of
Myovant to a third party which could make any outreach futile, the likelihood that few parties other than one of
Myovant to a third party which could make any outreach futile, the likelihood that few parties other than one of
Myovant’s current commercial partners would be interested in a transaction and the potential negative impact on
Myovant and its relationships with third parties if such outreach were to become known, that the Special Committee
could determine to reach out to third parties at a later time, and the expectation that any merger agreement that might
ultimately be entered into with Sumitovant would be expected to allow the Special Committee to consider unsolicited
inbound acquisition proposals that might be made. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined not to
reach out to third parties at that time.
On September 15, 2022, the Special Committee held an in person meeting (which Mr. Guinan joined by
videoconference), with David Marek, Myovant’s Principal Executive Officer, Uneek Mehra, Myovant’s Principal
Financial Officer and Matthew Lang, Myovant’s General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance by videoconference. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an
update to the Special Committee on their interactions with J.P. Morgan, including regarding due diligence and the
evaluation process being conducted by Sumitovant and SMP of a possible transaction. Representatives of Skadden
provided an overview of the types of interim operating restrictions that would be expected to apply to Myovant’s
business operations between the signing and closing of a possible transaction with Sumitovant and of employee
retention considerations to protect Myovant’s business against disruption and loss of employees during the period
between the signing and closing of a possible transaction. The Special Committee requested management to work
with Skadden to prepare a recommendation for the Special Committee regarding a possible employee retention
proposal if Sumitovant and SMP were to make a proposal.
Also on September 15, 2022, the Myovant Board held a regularly scheduled in person meeting, with
management in attendance (with certain participants in attendance by videoconference). During the meeting,
management presented to the Myovant Board a financial update based on year-to-date results, which included an
update on projected fiscal year 2022 ORGOVYX® revenues, which were likely to be lower than reflected in the
projections for fiscal year 2022 ORGOVYX® revenues previously provided by management to the Myovant Board.
On September 16, 2022 and September 26, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan held calls to
discuss the status of due diligence and the process being conducted by Sumitovant and SMP to evaluate whether to
pursue a possible transaction with Myovant. Following the September 26 call, J.P. Morgan provided an updated list
of high priority diligence requests to Goldman Sachs on behalf of Sumitovant and SMP.
After the close of trading on September 30, 2022, Ms. Potter contacted Mr. Guinan to communicate that the
special committee of the board of directors of Sumitovant had met earlier that day and intended to provide a proposal
letter (the “proposal letter”) and that Sullivan & Cromwell would be delivering a draft of the Merger Agreement.
Shortly thereafter, Ms. Potter delivered the proposal letter containing a non-binding proposal to acquire all of the
Myovant common shares not already owned by Sumitovant for $22.75 per share in cash, reflecting a 26.7% premium
to Myovant’s last closing price per share of $17.96. In the proposal letter, Sumitovant and SMP stated that they were
only interested in acquiring additional Myovant common shares and not interested in selling any of the Myovant
common shares that Sumitovant owned or supporting any alternative sale, merger or similar transaction involving
Myovant. The proposal letter further noted that, consistent with the Investor Rights Agreement, the proposed
transaction would be subject to the approval of the Audit Committee and a non-waivable condition requiring the
approval of Myovant’s shareholders holding a majority of Myovant’s outstanding common shares that are not
owned by Sumitovant. Sumitovant also stated that in compliance with its obligations under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act, Sumitovant would be required to promptly file an amendment to its Schedule 13D to reflect the
contents of the proposal letter. Later in the evening on September 30, 2022, Sullivan & Cromwell provided an initial
draft of the Merger Agreement to Skadden.
After receipt of the proposal letter and draft of the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee held a meeting by
videoconference on October 1, 2022, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. The Special
Committee received an update on communications with Sumitovant and its advisors and discussed the proposal
letter, including the offer price and other terms of the proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs presented financial
analyses to the Special Committee based on Myovant’s management projections that the Special Committee had
previously instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to use in its
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
analyses, and representatives of Skadden reviewed certain legal considerations relating to the proposal and provided
an overview of the terms of the draft Merger Agreement received from Sullivan & Cromwell. Following evaluation and
discussion of the offer price and other terms of Sumitovant’s and SMP’s proposal, the Special Committee
unanimously determined that Sumitovant’s and SMP’s proposal significantly undervalued Myovant and, therefore,
was not in the best interests of Myovant or its shareholders. The Special Committee determined not to engage further
on Sumitovant’s due diligence requests or the draft Merger Agreement based on Sumitovant’s and SMP’s proposal
and instructed the Goldman Sachs representatives to inform the J.P. Morgan representatives of the Special
Committee’s determination.
Following the Special Committee’s meeting on October 1, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs communicated
to representatives of J.P. Morgan that the Special Committee determined that Sumitovant’s and SMP’s proposal
significantly undervalued Myovant and was not in the best interests of Myovant or its shareholders.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs also informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that the Special Committee had
determined not to engage with Sumitovant on its further due diligence or negotiation of the draft Merger Agreement.
On October 2, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an update on their interactions with
representatives of J.P. Morgan, noting that J.P. Morgan had not provided any revised proposal from Sumitovant and
SMP and that Sumitovant and SMP expected to issue a press release later that day to the effect that they had
submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire all of the Myovant common shares not already owned by Sumitovant
for $22.75 per share in cash. The Special Committee, together with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden,
discussed Myovant’s communications plan in response to Sumitovant’s and SMP’s expected press release and
authorized Myovant’s management to issue a press release as discussed at the meeting. The Special Committee
discussed with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden the possibility of conducting outreach to potential
third parties other than Sumitovant after public announcement of Sumitovant’s and SMP’s proposal to determine if
any third parties had interest in a potential transaction with Myovant, and following discussion, the Special
Committee determined not to do so at that time, noting the considerations regarding third party outreach discussed at
the August 22 meeting of the Special Committee and the fact that the public announcement of Sumitovant’s and
SMP’s proposal would put any potential bidders on notice of the opportunity to come forward with a proposal if they
were interested.
On October 2, 2022, Sumitovant and SMP issued a press release disclosing that it had made a proposal on
September 30, 2022 to acquire Myovant’s outstanding common shares not already owned by Sumitovant for $22.75
per share in cash. Myovant also issued a press release announcing the receipt of Sumitovant’s and SMP’s proposal
and the Special Committee’s unanimous determination that such proposal significantly undervalued Myovant and,
therefore, was not in the best interests of Myovant or its shareholders.
On October 3, 2022, Sumitovant filed an amendment to its Schedule 13D with the SEC, disclosing that it had
made a proposal on September 30, 2022 to acquire Myovant’s outstanding common shares not already owned by
Sumitovant for $22.75 per share in cash and attaching a copy of the proposal letter.
On October 3, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Skadden in attendance. At the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs
provided an update on the trading in Myovant’s common shares following the public announcement of Sumitovant’s
and SMP’s proposal and discussed certain potential next steps with respect to Sumitovant’s and SMP’s proposal.
On October 4, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Skadden in attendance. At the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs
provided an update on the trading in Myovant’s common shares following the public announcement of Sumitovant’s
and SMP’s proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed certain investor communications that had
occurred since October 3. The Special Committee discussed with its advisors potential next steps with respect to
Sumitovant and SMP under different scenarios.
On October 5, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of a third party (“Company A”), a
large pharmaceutical company, discussed the public announcement and Company A informed Goldman Sachs that it
was evaluating a possible transaction with Myovant.
29
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on October 5, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the request of Sumitovant and SMP, contacted
representatives of Goldman Sachs to inquire whether, if Sumitovant and SMP were able to confirm that they would be
willing to make a proposal at least at or near recent trading prices of Myovant’s common shares (which closed at
$25.48 per share on October 4, 2022), it would be possible for the parties to proceed with further due diligence and
negotiation of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents. Representatives of J.P. Morgan indicated
that once due diligence and merger agreement negotiations were substantially complete, Sumitovant and SMP would
expect to be in a position, subject to receipt of internal governance approvals and the results of due diligence, to
make an improved proposal for a possible transaction that they would be prepared to negotiate to reach a final
agreement that could be supported by the Special Committee. Representatives of Goldman Sachs noted to
representatives of J.P. Morgan that they would report this discussion to the Special Committee, but that any
willingness to provide further due diligence and commence merger agreement negotiations should not be interpreted
to mean that the price indicated by J.P. Morgan would be acceptable to the Special Committee.
Following the discussion between representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs on October 5, 2022, the
Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in
attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reported on a call they had with representatives of Company A,
noting that Company A was evaluating a potential transaction with Myovant, but that Company A did not believe it
likely that it would propose a transaction given that Sumitovant and SMP had publicly stated that Sumitovant was
not willing to sell its Myovant shares and would not support an alternative merger, consolidation or similar
transaction with a third party involving Myovant. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reported on discussions
with representatives of J.P. Morgan, noting Sumitovant’s and SMP’s proposal to move forward with their further due
diligence and commence negotiations of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents if Sumitovant and
SMP would confirm their willingness to make an improved proposal at or near recent trading prices of Myovant’s
common shares. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined to permit Sumitovant and SMP to continue
due diligence and commence merger agreement negotiations, subject to Sumitovant and SMP confirming their
understanding that they would need to increase their proposed price significantly beyond the current trading price in
order to obtain the Special Committee’s ultimate support of any transaction. The Special Committee authorized
representatives of Goldman Sachs to convey to representatives of J.P. Morgan, for negotiation purposes, that
Sumitovant should be looking to provide value near $30.00 per share, which representatives of Goldman Sachs did
later that day.
On October 6, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan confirmed to representatives of Goldman Sachs that
Sumitovant and SMP acknowledged Myovant’s desired value improvement in accordance with the Special
Committee’s condition to providing additional due diligence and commencing merger agreement negotiations and
that Sumitovant’s and SMP’s ability to provide such desired value improvement for a transaction would depend on
the outcome of its due diligence findings.
On October 7, 2022, representatives of Myovant began providing additional responses to Sumitovant’s due
diligence requests.
Also on October 7, 2022, Skadden sent a revised draft Merger Agreement and an initial draft Sumitovant Voting
Agreement to Sullivan & Cromwell.
On October 11, 2022, Sullivan & Cromwell sent Skadden revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the
Sumitovant Voting Agreement.
Also on October 11, 2022, Company A informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that after carefully
considering the opportunity for a potential transaction with Myovant and discussing the opportunity internally,
Company A had determined that it would not submit a proposal for a transaction with Myovant. Thereafter,
representatives of Goldman Sachs informed the Chairman of the Special Committee of this fact.
Between October 12, 2022 and October 19, 2022, representatives of Skadden and Sullivan & Cromwell had
various calls and discussed potential revisions to the drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting
Agreement, and exchanged drafts of each document, resolving a number of issues related to the conditions to
Closing, Myovant’s representations and warranties and interim operating covenants, the provisions related to the
Special Committee’s ability to consider alternative proposals, and Sumitovant’s required efforts to obtain any
necessary approvals.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On October 17, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with Mr. Marek and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. At the request of the Special Committee, Mr. Marek
discussed the need for employee retention to ensure business continuity during the period between signing and
closing of a transaction and reviewed management’s proposal for employee retention in connection with any possible
transaction with Sumitovant and SMP if recommended by the Special Committee. At the request of the Special
Committee, Mr. Marek exited the meeting, and representatives of Skadden reviewed key business and legal issues in
the latest draft of the Merger Agreement provided by Sullivan & Cromwell in connection with Sumitovant’s and
SMP’s proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with the Special Committee that Company A had
determined not to submit a proposal for a transaction with Myovant.
On October 19, 2022, the Myovant Board held a meeting by videoconference, during which the directors
discussed, among other things, not making the regular and automatic annual grant of stock options pursuant to the
Non-Executive Director Compensation Plan to non-executive directors that were scheduled to be made on October 21,
2022 in light of the ongoing discussions between Myovant and Sumitovant. The Myovant Board discussed that
such stock option grant could be replaced by a restricted stock unit grant with equivalent value to be determined at a
later Myovant Board meeting (which could be valued at the transaction price if a transaction were recommended by
the Special Committee and approved by the Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors)). Following the
Myovant Board meeting, the Compensation Committee resolved that the regular and automatic annual grant of stock
options pursuant to the Non-Executive Director Compensation Plan to such non-executive directors would not be
made on October 21, 2022.
On October 19, 2022, Ms. Potter, Mr. Guinan and representatives of Skadden and Sullivan & Cromwell had a call
to discuss most of the remaining open issues, apart from the price per share payable as merger consideration, with
respect to the Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, including, among other things, regarding (i)
certain compensation and benefits matters, including with respect to employee retention and severance protections,
(ii) post-Closing employee compensation and benefits matters, and (iii) the amount of the termination fee payable in
the event of certain terminations of the Merger Agreement. The amount of the price per share payable in the Merger
and the size of the proposed termination fee remained unresolved following the call.
Following the call on October 19, 2022, Sullivan & Cromwell sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and
the Sumitovant Voting Agreement to Skadden. Between October 19, 2022 and October 23, 2022, Skadden and Sullivan
& Cromwell exchanged drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and finalized the terms
of such agreements.
On October 20, 2022, the board of directors of SMP (the “SMP Board”) held a meeting by videoconference, with
representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and J.P. Morgan in attendance. During such meeting, the SMP Board (i)
reviewed the terms of the draft Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, as well as Sumitovant’s
diligence findings regarding Myovant, (ii) conditionally approved the delivery of a subsequent offer to Myovant of
up to a per share price of $27.00 and (iii) approved the entry into the Merger Agreement by Sumitovant and SMP,
subject to final approval by the board of directors of Sumitovant (the “Sumitovant Board”).
On October 21, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs to convey a
revised oral proposal from Sumitovant and SMP to acquire the outstanding Myovant common shares not already
owned by Sumitovant for $25.25 per share in cash, which represented a $2.50 per share increase from Sumitovant’s
and SMP’s initial offer price of $22.75, and reflected a 40.6% premium to Myovant’s closing price per share prior to
the public disclosure of the initial proposed offer (the “Undisturbed Stock Price”).
On the morning of October 21, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an
update on discussions with representatives of J.P. Morgan, noting that representatives of J.P. Morgan had
communicated, on behalf of Sumitovant and SMP, an increased proposal of $25.25 per share to acquire the
outstanding shares of Myovant not already owned by Sumitovant. At the request of the Special Committee, Mr.
Marek joined the meeting and provided management’s perspectives on the proposal and then exited the meeting. The
Special Committee discussed Sumitovant’s and SMP’s proposal and the financial analyses previously presented to
the Special Committee and authorized Goldman Sachs to respond to J.P. Morgan indicating that the Special Committee
was unwilling to accept Sumitovant’s and SMP’s offer of $25.25 per share
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and that Sumitovant and SMP would need to significantly increase their offer price for the Special Committee to
support a transaction. Following the Special Committee’s meeting on October 21, 2022, representatives of Goldman
Sachs communicated the Special Committee’s message to representatives of J.P. Morgan.
Later on October 21, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs by
telephone to convey a revised proposal from Sumitovant and SMP to acquire the outstanding Myovant common
shares not already owned by Sumitovant for $26.25 per share in cash, which represented a $1.00 per share increase
from the $25.25 per share proposal made by Sumitovant and SMP earlier that day, and reflected a 46.2% premium to
the Undisturbed Stock Price. The J.P. Morgan representatives indicated that this price reflected Sumitovant’s and
SMP’s views of Myovant’s fundamental value and that Sumitovant and SMP had limited ability to increase their
proposal from that price.
Following receipt of Sumitovant’s and SMP’s updated proposal on October 21, 2022, the Special Committee met
again by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs informed the Special Committee of Sumitovant’s and SMP’s latest proposal to acquire the
outstanding shares of Myovant not already owned by Sumitovant for $26.25 per share, and that representatives of
J.P. Morgan indicated that Sumitovant and SMP had limited ability to increase their offer price above $26.25 per share.
The Special Committee then discussed, together with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden, Sumitovant’s
and SMP’s revised proposal in the context of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses and the underlying assumptions. At
the request of the Special Committee, Mr. Marek joined the meeting to provide management’s perspectives on the
proposal, following which he exited the meeting. Following discussion, the Special Committee, for purposes of
negotiation, authorized representatives of Goldman Sachs to inform representatives of J.P. Morgan, among other
things, of the request for a higher offer price approaching $30.00 per share and that further negotiation of price, if any,
should be communicated between Mr. Guinan and Ms. Potter directly. Shortly after the Special Committee meeting,
representatives of Goldman Sachs relayed this message as instructed by the Special Committee to representatives of
J.P. Morgan.
Also on October 21, 2022, Sullivan & Cromwell provided to Skadden a version of SMP’s facility commitment
letter, dated as of October 21, 2022 (the “Facility Commitment Letter”), with terms relating to the aggregate
commitment amount, interest rates and mandatory prepayment redacted.
On October 22, 2022, Ms. Potter called Mr. Guinan and conveyed a further updated proposal to acquire the
outstanding Myovant common shares not already owned by Sumitovant for $26.75 per share in cash, which
represented a $0.50 per share increase from the $26.25 per share proposal made by Sumitovant and SMP on the
previous day. Mr. Guinan indicated that he did not believe that the Special Committee would be supportive of a
transaction at that price, to which Ms. Potter indicated that $27.00 per share was the best and final price she was able
to offer.
Also on October 22, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Guinan informed the Special Committee of
Sumitovant’s and SMP’s latest proposal to acquire the outstanding shares of Myovant not already owned by
Sumitovant for $26.75 per share. Mr. Guinan also informed the Special Committee that Ms. Potter indicated that $27.00
was the highest price Sumitovant and SMP would propose, which represented a 50.3% premium to the Undisturbed
Stock Price. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed its financial analyses. Following discussion, the Special
Committee, for purposes of negotiation, determined to request a purchase price of $28.50 per share and authorized
Mr. Guinan to convey to Ms. Potter the Special Committee’s counter-proposal of at least $28.50 per share.
Later on October 22, 2022, Mr. Guinan called Ms. Potter and conveyed the Special Committee’s counter-proposal
that Sumitovant and SMP increase their offer to at least $28.50 per share. Ms. Potter indicated that she did not have
authorization to offer above $27.00 per share, but would communicate the Special Committee’s request for at least
$28.50 per share to Sumitovant and SMP.
Later in the evening on October 22, 2022, Ms. Potter called Mr. Guinan to inform him that $27.00 per share was
Sumitovant’s and SMP’s best and final offer and that the transaction would not move forward if the Special
Committee required a higher price than $27.00 per share. Mr. Guinan noted that he would report that to the Special
Committee and would speak with Ms. Potter the following morning.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On the morning of October 23, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Mr. Guinan updated the Special Committee on his
discussion with Ms. Potter, noting that Ms. Potter informed Mr. Guinan that $27.00 per share was Sumitovant’s and
SMP’s best and final offer and that the transaction would not move forward if the Special Committee requested a
higher price than $27.00 per share. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed its financial analyses of the $27.00 per
share proposal. At the request of the Special Committee, Messrs. Marek and Mehra joined the meeting and reviewed
an update on projected fiscal year 2022 ORGOVYX® revenues based on year-to-date results that was previously
reviewed by management with the Myovant Board at its September 15 board meeting and responded to questions
from the Special Committee members, following which they exited the meeting. The Special Committee, together with
representatives of Goldman Sachs, discussed the possible impact of the updated ORGOVYX® performance on future
years’ sales, and representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed a sensitivity analysis regarding the potential impact on
valuation of the ORGOVYX® update and the potential impact on Myovant’s overall projections. Following
discussion, and taking into account, among other things, the indication that $27.00 per share was Sumitovant’s and
SMP’s best and final offer and the financial analyses reviewed by Goldman Sachs, the Special Committee determined
that it would be supportive of Sumitovant’s and SMP’s latest proposal of $27.00 per share, and authorized Mr. Guinan
to convey this message to Ms. Potter.
Following the Special Committee meeting on October 23, 2022, Mr. Guinan contacted Ms. Potter and informed
her that the Special Committee would support Sumitovant’s and SMP’s latest proposal of $27.00 per share. During
this discussion, Ms. Potter agreed to Mr. Guinan’s proposal of a termination fee of approximately 1.9% of the total
equity value of Myovant at the transaction price. Later that day, Sullivan & Cromwell sent a revised draft of the
Merger Agreement that included the agreed termination fee amount.
Later in the day on October 23, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with
representatives of Goldman Sachs, Skadden and Conyers in attendance. Representatives of Conyers provided an
overview of the duties of the Special Committee members under Bermuda law and discussed the application of such
duties to the Special Committee’s consideration of the proposed transaction with Sumitovant and SMP.
Representatives of Skadden reviewed the terms and conditions of the proposed Merger Agreement and the
Sumitovant Voting Agreement to be entered into in connection with the proposed transaction with Sumitovant and
SMP. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed their financial analyses of the proposed transaction. The Special
Committee members, with the assistance of Goldman Sachs and Skadden, discussed Sumitovant’s and SMP’s latest
proposal and the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Goldman Sachs delivered to
the Special Committee an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated October 23, 2022,
to the effect that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications,
limitations and other matters set forth in such written opinion, the $27.00 per share cash merger consideration that
would be paid to the holders of Myovant common shares (other than Sumitovant and its affiliates) in the proposed
transaction was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. Following discussion, the Special Committee
unanimously (i) determined that the per share merger consideration constitutes fair value for each common share in
accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act; (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Statutory
Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory
Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Myovant and its
shareholders (including “unaffiliated security holders,” as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act); and
(iii) recommended that the Myovant Board (a) declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the
Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, (b) adopt the Merger
Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, and (c) subject to
the right of the Myovant Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) and the Special
Committee to change their recommendations in certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, recommend
that Myovant’s shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory
Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory
Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, at a duly held meeting of Myovant’s shareholders for
such purpose.
Following the conclusion of the Special Committee meeting on October 23, 2022, the Myovant Board held a
meeting by videoconference, with Mr. Lang and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Skadden and Conyers in
attendance. Prior to the meeting, the Sumitomo Directors waived notice of the meeting and were not in attendance. A
representative of Conyers reviewed the directors’ duties in connection with the proposed
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
transaction. Representatives of Skadden provided an overview of the terms of the Merger Agreement and the
Sumitovant Voting Agreement. Mr. Guinan provided a report of the Special Committee’s evaluation of the proposed
transaction, including the various proposals made by Sumitovant and SMP prior to the latest revised proposal and
the Special Committee’s recommendation with respect to the Merger Agreement and the proposed transaction.
Representatives of Skadden reviewed the resolutions for approval of the transaction that were provided to the
directors in advance of the meeting and, following this review, the Myovant Board, based upon the Special
Committee’s recommendation, (i) determined that the per share merger consideration constitutes fair value for each
Myovant common share in accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act, (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement are fair to and in the best
interests of Myovant and its shareholders (including “unaffiliated security holders,” as defined under Rule 13e-3
under the Exchange Act), (iii) approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the
Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, and (iv) subject to the
right of the Myovant Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) and the Special Committee to
change their recommendations in certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, recommended that
Myovant’s shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory
Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory
Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, at a duly held meeting of Myovant’s shareholders for
such purpose. The Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors) also unanimously determined that in lieu of
the regular and automatic annual grant of stock options pursuant to the Non-Executive Director Compensation Plan
to non-executive directors, each non-executive director (other than Dr. Nishinaka) would be granted an award of
Myovant RSUs pursuant to the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan with a grant value equal to $266,200, with each such grant
valued at the per share merger consideration (provided that the number of Myovant RSUs subject to each grant shall
be rounded down to the nearest share). These Myovant RSUs, which were granted on October 26, 2022, shall (x) vest
in full on the earlier to occur of (i) October 26, 2023 and (ii) the date that is one day prior to Myovant’s 2023 annual
shareholder meeting, subject in each case to such non-executive director providing continuous service to Myovant
through such date, or (y) to the extent these Myovant RSUs have not vested as of the effective time, vest pro rata
based on the number of days such non-executive director has served since October 26, 2022, and the vested
Myovant RSUs shall cancelled in exchange for the Myovant RSU consideration as set forth in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement-Treatment of Myovant Equity Awards-Restricted Share Units and Performance Share
Units,” and the unvested Myovant RSUs shall be cancelled without payment as of the effective time.
Also on October 23, 2022, the Sumitovant Board met and approved the entry into the Merger Agreement by
Sumitovant and SMP and the entry into the Sumitovant Voting Agreement by Sumitovant.
Following the conclusion of the board meeting on October 23, 2022, Myovant, Sumitovant and SMP executed
the Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, and issued a joint press release announcing the
transaction.
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board; Fairness of the
Merger
The Special Committee
On October 23, 2022, the Special Committee adopted resolutions by unanimous vote of its members at a meeting
duly called (i) determining that the per share merger consideration constitutes fair value for each Myovant common
share in accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act, (ii) determining that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the
Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the
Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Myovant
and its shareholders (including “unaffiliated security holders,” as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act);
and (iii) recommending that the Myovant Board (a) declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the
Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, (b) adopt the Merger
Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and (c) subject to
the right of the Myovant Board (acting upon the
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
recommendation of the Special Committee) and the Special Committee to change their recommendations in certain
circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, recommend that Myovant’s shareholders vote in favor of the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting
Agreement, at a duly held meeting of Myovant’s shareholders for such purpose.
In the course of reaching its determination and making its recommendation, the Special Committee considered a
number of potentially positive factors, including, but not limited to, the following (which factors are not necessarily
presented in order of relative importance):
•
Compelling and Fair Value. The Special Committee members believe that the per share merger
consideration represents compelling and fair value for Myovant common shares based on the Special
Committee’s overall knowledge and understanding, and information obtained by the Special Committee
(including from Myovant management and the Special Committee’s independent financial advisor),
regarding Myovant’s business, operations, assets and liabilities, current, historical and prospective
business, financial condition, results of operations, strategy and competitive position, as well as industry
trends, long-term strategic goals and opportunities, including the potential impact of those factors on the
trading price of Myovant common shares (which cannot be quantified numerically).
•
Premium to Market Price. The Special Committee considered the current and historical trading prices of
Myovant common shares, including the relationship of the $27.00 per share merger consideration to the
recent and historical trading prices of Myovant common shares, including that the per share merger
consideration represents:
•
a premium of approximately 50.3% to the closing price per Myovant common share on September 30,
2022 (the last trading day prior to the public announcement of Sumitovant’s initial non-binding
proposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own, on
which date the closing price was $17.96);
•
a premium of approximately 48.4% to the 30-calendar day VWAP per Myovant common share through
September 30, 2022 (which was $18.19); and
•
a premium of approximately 13.1% to the 52-week high trading price per Myovant common share as of
September 30, 2022 (which was $23.87).
•
Per Share Merger Consideration. The Special Committee considered:
•
that the per share merger consideration consists solely of cash, which provides certainty of value and
immediate liquidity at Closing to the Minority Shareholders, particularly in light of the relatively limited
trading volume of the Myovant common shares, without the long-term business and execution risk
associated with Myovant’s long-term plans; and
•
the fact that all of the Minority Shareholders will be entitled to receive the same per share merger
consideration.
•
Special Committee’s Negotiations. The Special Committee considered its extensive negotiations with
Sumitovant, and the fact that, during the course of such negotiations, Sumitovant raised the value of the
per share merger consideration offered four times, from $22.75, to $25.25, to $26.25, to $26.75 and finally to
$27.00 (representing a total increase of 18.7%), which Sumitovant indicated was its best and final offer for
Myovant and which the Special Committee believed, after such negotiations with Sumitovant and its
representatives, was the highest price per share obtainable from Sumitovant for the outstanding Myovant
common shares not already owned by Sumitovant.
•
Financial Analyses and Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The Special Committee considered the financial
analyses and the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion,
dated October 23, 2022 (which financial analyses and opinion were adopted by the Special Committee), that,
as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and
assumptions set forth therein, the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid to the Minority
Shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as
more fully described below in the section entitled “Special Factors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the
Special Committee” and the full text of the opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Potential Benefits of Business Combination. The Special Committee considered that the transaction
provides benefits for Myovant in addition to the attractive value to Myovant shareholders, including:
•
the likelihood that the Merger will reduce development and commercialization risk for Myovant by
allowing Myovant to leverage the resources and expertise of Sumitovant and its affiliates to swiftly
drive the development and commercialization of ORGOVYX® and MYFEMBREE®;
•
that the Merger represents an opportunity to combine the expertise, platforms and resources of both
Myovant and Sumitovant to address unmet needs in women’s health and prostate cancer; and
•
the potential risks associated with remaining as a separate public company with a majority shareholder
and possible alternative business strategies instead of consummating the Merger.
•
Low Likelihood of Alternative Transactions. The Special Committee considered:
•
the fact that Sumitovant owns a majority of the outstanding Myovant common shares, and
communicated to the Special Committee in its publicly filed, initial non-binding proposal letter
delivered on September 30, 2022 that Sumitovant, in its capacity as a majority shareholder of Myovant,
is interested only in acquiring Myovant common shares not already owned by Sumitovant and that in
such capacity, Sumitovant has no interest in selling any Myovant common shares it owns, nor would
Sumitovant support any alternative sale, merger or similar transaction involving Myovant, which
could discourage the making of a competing acquisition proposal; and
•
the absence of other strategic alternatives available to Myovant that would provide comparable or
superior value to Myovant shareholders, based in part on the Special Committee’s determination,
following consultation with its independent financial advisor and taking into account the fact that
Sumitovant’s proposal had been publicly announced and that thereafter no third party had submitted
a proposal to acquire Myovant prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (including the fact that
Company A, after considering the opportunity for a transaction with Myovant and discussing it with
the Special Committee’s independent financial advisor, had determined to not submit a proposal for a
transaction with Myovant).
•
Timing Considerations. The Special Committee considered:
•
the timing of the Merger and the risk that if Myovant does not accept Sumitovant’s offer now, it may
not have another opportunity to do so or to pursue an opportunity offering the same or better value
and certainty to Myovant’s shareholders in the future; and
•
the fact that the standstill restrictions that apply to Sumitovant pursuant to the Investor Rights
Agreement would expire on December 27, 2022, and that, following such expiration, Sumitovant could
acquire the remaining Myovant common shares it does not already own with only the requisite
shareholder approvals and without the approval of the independent directors serving on the Audit
Committee, which could decrease Myovant’s negotiating power and could result in the consideration
and/or terms of such transaction being less favorable to Myovant and its shareholders than the per
share merger consideration and the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
•
Certainty of Closing. The Special Committee took into account its belief that the Merger has a high
likelihood of being completed in a timely manner based on, among other things, (i) the reputation,
acquisition experience and financial resources of Sumitovant and its ability to complete an acquisition
transaction involving the Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own, (ii) the limited
number and nature of the conditions to the completion of the Merger, including the fact that there is no
financing condition, (iii) Sumitovant entering into the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and (iv) Myovant’s
ability, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to pursue remedies that include specific performance and
equitable relief to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement by Sumitovant and to specifically enforce the
terms of the Merger Agreement.
•
Terms of the Transaction Documents. The Special Committee considered the terms of the Merger
Agreement and other transaction documents, including the review by the Special Committee with its
independent financial advisor and legal counsel of, and advice received from such advisor and counsel on,
the structure of the contemplated transactions and financial and other terms of the Merger
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agreement and the other agreements entered into in connection with the Merger, including with respect to
deal protection, conditionality, termination rights and the likelihood of consummating the Merger
(including with respect to obtaining required shareholder approvals and required HSR approval).
•
Ability to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Alternative Proposals. The Special Committee considered
that the Merger Agreement gives the Special Committee the right to respond to, furnish information
and negotiate with respect to unsolicited alternative proposals from third parties in certain
circumstances described in the Merger Agreement and to change its recommendation to Myovant’s
shareholders to vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement if a superior
proposal is available or in response to an intervening event (as defined in the section below entitled
“The Merger Agreement-No Solicitation; No Change in Myovant Recommendation”).
•
Myovant Termination Rights. The Special Committee considered that Myovant would be permitted,
under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement
in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal after giving Sumitovant the
opportunity to match the superior proposal and upon payment of the termination fee equal to
$55,250,000 (which is approximately 1.9% of the total equity value of Myovant at the transaction
price).
•
Termination Fee. The Special Committee believes that the termination fee of $55,250,000 that could
become payable by Myovant pursuant to the Merger Agreement in the event the Merger Agreement
is terminated under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement is reasonable and would
not likely deter third parties from making alternative acquisition proposals that would be more
favorable to Myovant’s shareholders than the Merger.
•
No Financing Condition. The Special Committee considered the fact that Sumitovant has financing in
place to fund the aggregate per share merger consideration and any transaction expenses, that SMP
has irrevocably guaranteed the due and punctual payment obligations of Sumitovant and Merger Sub
under the Merger Agreement and that Sumitovant’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to complete the
Merger and pay the aggregate per share merger consideration are not conditioned on Sumitovant or
Merger Sub obtaining financing.
•
Sumitovant Voting Agreement. The Special Committee considered the fact that Sumitovant entered
into the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, pursuant to which Sumitovant has agreed, among other
things, to vote or cause to be voted all of the Myovant common shares that it or its affiliates (other
than Myovant and its subsidiaries) beneficially own in favor of the Merger Proposal and all of the
other proposals presented at the special general meeting.
•
Appraisal Rights. The Special Committee considered the availability of appraisal rights to shareholders of
Myovant who do not vote in favor of the Merger, which rights provide eligible shareholders with the
opportunity to have Bermuda courts determine the fair value of their shares.
•
Employee Considerations. The Special Committee believes that treatment of equity awards held by
management and employees, the treatment of the transaction as a “Change in Control” under Myovant’s
severance arrangements and the ability to adopt an employee retention plan approved by the Special
Committee will reduce the risk of attrition of key employees during the pre-Closing period, which will help
ensure continuity of Myovant’s business during the period prior to closing under the Merger Agreement
(thereby reducing risk of non-consummation), and could reduce the risk to Myovant if the Merger
Agreement is terminated.
•
Procedural Safeguards. The Special Committee considered the following procedural safeguards
implemented in an effort to ensure the fairness of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and to permit
the Special Committee to represent the interests of the Minority Shareholders:
•
the Special Committee consists solely of directors of Myovant who are independent directors not
affiliated with Sumitovant and who are not officers or employees of Myovant, and who are
independent and disinterested with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement,
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and the Special Committee was advised by an independent legal counsel and an independent financial
advisor in its review, evaluation and negotiation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting
Agreement;
•
the resolutions of the Myovant Board forming the Special Committee and authorizing the Special
Committee to oversee matters relating to a potential transaction with Sumitovant and any alternatives
thereto, including, without limitation, (i) evaluating any proposal from Sumitovant with respect to a
potential transaction and any alternatives thereto in order to make a recommendation to the Myovant
Board as to whether Myovant should seek into engage in the potential transaction with Sumitovant
and (ii) if determined that Myovant should seek to engage in the potential transaction, developing,
assessing and negotiating the terms of the potential transaction with Sumitovant and making a
recommendation to the full Myovant Board as to whether Myovant should enter into such potential
transaction, and the fact that the Myovant Board was not permitted to approve any transaction with
Sumitovant unless recommended by the Special Committee;
•
the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, including the standstill restrictions, which provide
additional protections to the Minority Shareholders in connection with any business combination
transaction between Myovant and Sumitovant, including the requirement that any such business
combination transaction be approved by the independent directors serving on the Audit Committee
and by a majority of Myovant’s outstanding voting shares not owned by Sumitovant or its affiliates;
and
•
the fact that Sumitovant’s proposal was conditioned on approval by the three independent directors
serving on the Audit Committee and the approval of Myovant’s shareholders holding a majority of the
outstanding Myovant common shares not owned by Sumitovant or its affiliates.
In the course of reaching its determinations and making its recommendations, the Special Committee also
considered the following countervailing factors concerning the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement
and the Merger:
•
General Transaction Risks. The Special Committee considered the risks involved with the Merger,
including the risk that the Merger may not be completed because one or more of the conditions to Closing
(including HSR clearance) would not be satisfied, and the effect that failing to complete the Merger may
have on the business, financial results and share price of Myovant, or on the perceptions of Myovant
among investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders.
•
No Shareholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Special Committee considered the fact
that Myovant will no longer exist as a separate public company and Myovant’s shareholders will forego
any potential future increase in its value as a separate public company that might result from its possible
growth and future prospects.
•
Impact of Announcement on Myovant. The Special Committee considered the possible negative effects of
the Merger and public announcement of the Merger on Myovant’s business, financial performance,
operating results and share price and Myovant’s relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors,
commercial partners, management and employees.
•
No Solicitation. The Special Committee considered the fact that the Merger Agreement (i) precludes
Myovant from actively soliciting competing acquisition proposals (as described in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement-No Solicitation; No Change in Myovant Recommendation”) and (ii) obligates
Myovant (or its successor) to pay Sumitovant the termination fee of $55,250,000 in connection with a
termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, which could discourage the making of a
competing acquisition proposal or adversely impact the price offered in such a proposal.
•
Pre-Closing Covenants. The Special Committee considered the fact that the Merger Agreement imposes
restrictions on the conduct of Myovant’s business in the pre-Closing period, which may adversely affect
Myovant’s business in the event the Merger is not completed (including by delaying or preventing
Myovant from pursuing business opportunities that may arise or precluding actions that would be
advisable if Myovant were to remain a separate public company).
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Management Attention. The Special Committee considered the risk that the contemplated transactions may
divert management focus and resources from operating Myovant’s business, as well as other strategic
opportunities.
•
Expenses. The Special Committee considered the substantial transaction expenses to be incurred in
connection with the Merger (including that Myovant may become obligated to pay Sumitovant a
termination fee of $55,250,000 in connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement under certain
circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement) and the negative impact of such expenses on
Myovant’s cash reserves and operating results should the Merger not be completed.
•
Tax Consequences. The Special Committee considered the fact that the per share merger consideration
consists solely of cash and will therefore be taxable to Myovant shareholders who are subject to taxation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•
Litigation. The Special Committee considered the risk of potential litigation relating to the Merger that
could be instituted against Myovant and/or its directors and officers, and the potential effects of any
outcomes related thereto, including potential management distraction and expenses that could result from
such litigation.
•
Director and Officer Interests. The Special Committee considered the fact that Myovant’s directors and
executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be deemed to be different from, or in addition
to, those of Myovant’s other shareholders generally, as described in the section entitled “Special Factors-
Interests of Myovant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The Special Committee did not specifically consider the liquidation value or the net book value of Myovant in
its evaluation of the Merger because of its belief that neither liquidation value nor net book value presents a
meaningful valuation for Myovant and its business, as Myovant’s value is derived from the cash flows anticipated to
be generated from its continuing operations, including revenues Myovant is projected to realize from the
commercialization of its drug products and candidates, rather than from the value of assets that might be realized in a
liquidation or from net book value which is significantly influenced by historical costs. Further, the Special Committee
did not consider liquidation value in evaluating the Merger because of its belief that Myovant remains a viable going
concern and that any prospective acquirer of Myovant, including Sumitovant, would continue to operate Myovant
as a going concern following the consummation of such transaction. Neither the Special Committee nor Goldman
Sachs conducted a separate going-concern valuation of Myovant because the financial analyses presented by
Goldman Sachs, as more fully described in the sections titled “Special Factors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the
Special Committee,” contained financial analyses of the cash flows anticipated to be generated by Myovant’s
continuing operations as a going concern, as reflected in the Revised Projections, and the Special Committee
believed these analyses to be appropriate to illustrate the value of Myovant as a going concern. The Special
Committee considered the purchase prices of Myovant common shares paid in previous purchases of Myovant
common shares as described under “Transactions in Common Shares-Transactions in Common Shares by the
Purchaser Filing Persons During the Past Two Years.” The then-current market price of Myovant common shares on
September 30, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the public announcement of Sumitovant’s initial non-binding
proposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own, on which date the
closing price was $17.96), as well as the majority of the historical market closing prices of Myovant common shares in
the last two years, were lower than the per share merger consideration. The Special Committee therefore considered
these to be positive factors and potential benefits of the Merger. Myovant is not aware of any firm offers made by
any unaffiliated person, other than the Purchaser Filing Persons, during the past two years for (i) the merger or
consolidation of Myovant with or into another company, or vice versa; (ii) the sale or other transfer of all or any
substantial part of the assets of Myovant; or (iii) a purchase of Myovant’s securities that would enable the holder to
exercise control of Myovant.
The Special Committee notes that the opinion delivered by Goldman Sachs addresses the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the Minority Shareholders, including the director and officer shareholders of Myovant who
are affiliates of Myovant. These director and officer shareholders are treated in the same way with respect to their
Myovant common shares as the unaffiliated security holders in connection with the Merger, and such director and
officer shareholders will receive the same per share merger consideration for their Myovant common shares as the
unaffiliated security holders. In addition, the Goldman Sachs opinion expressly states that Goldman
 
39
 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Sachs did not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any other compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Myovant, or class of such persons, in connection with the
Merger, whether relative to the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid to the Minority Shareholders
pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Therefore, the Special Committee believes there is no material
distinction between the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated security holders and the Minority Shareholders and
does not believe the inclusion of these director and officer shareholders as being encompassed in the universe of
Minority Shareholders affects the Special Committee’s ability to rely on the opinion of Goldman Sachs as one of the
many factors on which the Special Committee determined that the Merger is fair to the unaffiliated security holders.
After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Special Committee concluded
that the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger were outweighed
by the potential benefits of the Merger to Myovant’s shareholders.
The above discussion of the information and factors considered by the Special Committee is not intended to be
exhaustive, but indicates the material matters considered. In reaching its determination and recommendation, the
Special Committee did not quantify, rank or assign any relative or specific weight to any of the foregoing factors, and
individual members of the Special Committee may have considered various factors differently. The Special Committee
did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any specific factor, or any particular aspect of any
factor, supported or did not support its ultimate recommendation. Moreover, in considering the information and
factors described above, individual members of the Special Committee may have given differing weights to differing
factors. The Special Committee based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented.
The Myovant Board
At a meeting held on October 23, 2022, the Myovant Board (which for purposes of this section means other than
the Sumitomo Directors, who waived notice of, and recused themselves from, the Myovant Board meeting, and
abstained from voting on matters relating to the proposed transaction with Myovant), acting upon the unanimous
recommendation of the Special Committee, adopted resolutions by vote of its members (i) determining that the per
share merger consideration constitutes fair value for each Myovant common share in accordance with the Bermuda
Companies Act, (ii) determining that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the
Sumitovant Voting Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Myovant and its shareholders (including
“unaffiliated security holders,” as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act), (iii) declaring advisable the
execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant
Voting Agreement, (iv) adopting the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and approving the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the
Sumitovant Voting Agreement, and (v) subject to the right of the Myovant Board (acting upon the recommendation
of the Special Committee) and the Special Committee to change their recommendations in certain circumstances
specified in the Merger Agreement, recommending that Myovant’s shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and
approval of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, at a
duly held meeting of Myovant’s shareholders for such purpose.
The Myovant Board considered and relied upon the analyses and the unanimous recommendation of the
Special Committee (which analyses and unanimous recommendation were adopted by the Myovant Board) as set
forth in the section above entitled “-The Special Committee” in arriving at this determination and recommendation. In
considering the Special Committee’s analyses and recommendation, the Myovant Board reviewed and discussed
information with respect to Myovant’s financial condition, results of operations, businesses, competitive position
and business strategy, on a historical and prospective basis, as well as current industry, economic and market
conditions and trends, and discussed the Special Committee’s recommendation
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
with the members of the Special Committee and the independent financial advisor and legal counsel of the Special
Committee. The following are the material factors that supported the Myovant Board’s determination and
recommendation, in addition to the factors set forth in the section above entitled “-The Special Committee”:
•
Special Committee Recommendation. The Myovant Board considered and relied upon the analyses and
the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee (which analyses and unanimous recommendation
were adopted by the Myovant Board) as set forth in the section above entitled “-The Special Committee.”
•
Procedural Safeguards. The Myovant Board considered the following procedural safeguards implemented
in an effort to ensure the fairness of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement to permit the Special
Committee to represent the interests of the Minority Shareholders:
•
the Special Committee consists solely of directors of Myovant who are independent directors not
affiliated with Sumitovant and who are not officers or employees of Myovant, and who are
independent and disinterested with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, and
the Special Committee was advised by an independent legal counsel and an independent financial
advisor in its review, evaluation and negotiation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting
Agreement;
•
the resolutions of the Myovant Board forming the Special Committee and authorizing the Special
Committee to oversee matters relating to a potential transaction with Sumitovant and any alternatives
thereto, including, without limitation, (i) evaluating any proposal from Sumitovant with respect to a
potential transaction and any alternatives thereto in order to make a recommendation to the Myovant
Board as to whether Myovant should seek into engage in the potential transaction with Sumitovant
and (ii) if determined that Myovant should seek to engage in the potential transaction, developing,
assessing and negotiating the terms of the potential transaction with Sumitovant and making a
recommendation to the full Myovant Board as to whether Myovant should enter into such potential
transaction, and the fact that the Myovant Board was not permitted to approve any transaction with
Sumitovant unless recommended by the Special Committee;
•
the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, including the standstill restrictions, which provide
additional protections to the Minority Shareholders in connection with any business combination
transaction between Myovant and Sumitovant, including the requirement that any such business
combination transaction be approved by the independent directors serving on the Audit Committee
and by a majority of Myovant’s outstanding voting shares not owned by Sumitovant or its affiliates;
and
•
the fact that Sumitovant’s proposal was conditioned on approval by the independent directors
serving on the Audit Committee and the approval of Myovant’s shareholders holding a majority of the
outstanding Myovant common shares not owned by Sumitovant or its affiliates.
•
Special Committee’s Negotiations. The Myovant Board considered the Special Committee’s negotiations
with Sumitovant, and the fact that, during the course of such negotiations, Sumitovant raised the value of
the per share merger consideration offered four times, from $22.75, to $25.25, to $26.25, to $26.75 and finally
to $27.00 (representing a total increase of 18.7%), which Sumitovant indicated was its best and final offer
for Myovant and which the Myovant Board believed, after such negotiations with Sumitovant and its
representatives, was the highest price per share obtainable from Sumitovant for the outstanding Myovant
common shares not already owned by Sumitovant.
•
Special Committee’s Process. The Myovant Board considered the fact that the Special Committee held 19
meetings with its independent financial advisor and legal counsel to discuss and evaluate the
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
transaction with Sumitovant, other alternatives to the transaction and other matters related thereto and was
advised by a nationally recognized independent financial advisor and a nationally recognized independent
legal counsel, and that each member of the Special Committee was actively engaged in the process on a
continuous and regular basis.
•
Financial Analyses and Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The Myovant Board considered the financial
analyses and the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs as delivered to the Special Committee, subsequently
confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated October 23, 2022 (which financial analyses and opinion
were adopted by the Special Committee), that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject
to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the $27.00 in cash per share merger
consideration to be paid to the Minority Shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in the section entitled “Special
Factors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee” and the full text of the opinion, which is
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.
In considering the recommendations of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board (acting upon the
unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee), Myovant’s shareholders should be aware that Myovant’s
directors and executive officers may have interests with respect to the contemplated transactions that may be in
addition to, or that may be different from, the interests of the Minority Shareholders generally, as described in the
section entitled “Special Factors-Interests of Myovant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.” The
members of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board were aware of these interests and considered them,
among others, in reaching their determinations to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement
and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger
Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, and to make their recommendations to the Myovant Board and
Myovant’s shareholders, as applicable.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee
Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Special Committee that, as of October 23, 2022, and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid
to the Minority Shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated October 23, 2022, which sets forth assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the
opinion, is attached as Annex C. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion contained in this proxy statement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs provided
advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Special Committee in its consideration of
the Merger. Goldman Sachs’ opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Myovant common shares
should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.
•
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,
Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the Merger Agreement;
•
Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Myovant for the five fiscal years ended March 31, 2022;
•
certain other communications from Myovant to its shareholders;
•
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Myovant;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Myovant; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Myovant, including assumed probabilities
associated with certain future events contemplated by such forecasts, and certain analyses related to
the expected utilization by Myovant of certain net operating loss carryforwards and research and
development credit carryforwards of Myovant, each as prepared by the management of Myovant and
approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the Special Committee.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Myovant regarding their
assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Myovant;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for Myovant common shares; compared certain financial and stock
market information for Myovant with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are
publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent minority squeeze out transactions, including in the
biopharmaceutical industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as
Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Special Committee’s consent, relied upon and
assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information
provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Special Committee’s consent that the Revised
Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the Special Committee. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Myovant or any of
its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs
assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to
its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the
Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any
way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Myovant to engage in the
Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to
Myovant; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses
only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Minority Shareholders, as of the date of the opinion, of the
$27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion

TABLE OF CONTENTS
does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the
Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
entered into or amended in connection with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration
received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
Myovant; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of Myovant, or class of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether
relative to the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid to the Minority Shareholders pursuant to the
Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and
other conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman
Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances,
developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any
opinion as to the prices at which Myovant common shares will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of
volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Myovant, Sumitovant or the Merger, or as to the impact of the
Merger on the solvency or viability of Myovant or Sumitovant or the ability of Myovant or Sumitovant to pay their
respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of
Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Special
Committee in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not
purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of
analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the
summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together
with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is
based on market data as it existed on or before October 21, 2022, the last trading day before the public announcement
of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to the holders of
Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to (i) the closing price per Myovant common
share on September 30, 2022, the last trading day before public announcement of Sumitovant’s initial non-binding
proposal to acquire Myovant, (ii) the VWAP per Myovant common share for the preceding 30-calendar day period
ended September 30, 2022, and (iii) the high closing price per Myovant common share for the 52-week period ended
September 30, 2022.
This analysis indicated that the price per Myovant common share to be paid to the Minority Shareholders
pursuant to the Merger Agreement represented:
•
a premium of approximately 50.3% to the closing price per Myovant common share on September 30, 2022
(the last trading day prior to the public announcement of Sumitovant’s initial non-binding proposal to
acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own, on which date the
closing price was $17.96);
•
a premium of approximately 48.4% to the 30-calendar day VWAP per Myovant common share through
September 30, 2022 (which was $18.19); and
•
a premium of approximately 13.1% to the 52-week high trading price per Myovant common share as of
September 30, 2022 (which was $23.87).
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Revised Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an
illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Myovant. Using a mid-year convention and discount rates ranging from
12.0% to 14.0%, reflecting estimates of Myovant’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), Goldman Sachs
discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Myovant for the second,
third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022 and the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 (“fiscal year 2023”) through the
fiscal year ending March 31, 2037 (“fiscal year 2036”) as reflected in the Revised Projections and (ii) a range of
illustrative terminal values for Myovant, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from
(60.0%) to (100.0%) to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow to be generated by Myovant, as reflected in the
Revised Projections. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model,
which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Myovant’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for
Myovant, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity
growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account
the Revised Projections and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and
inflation. In addition, using a discount rate of 13.0%, reflecting an estimate of Myovant’s WACC, Goldman Sachs
discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 the estimated benefits of Myovant’s net operating losses (“NOLs”)
for fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2036, as reflected in the Revised Projections. Goldman Sachs derived a range
of illustrative enterprise values for Myovant by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above
and reflecting Myovant’s net cash balance of $0 as of June 30, 2022. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of
illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Myovant, as provided by the
management of Myovant and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the Special Committee, to derive a range of
illustrative present values per Myovant common share ranging from $25.59 to $30.74.
Premia Analyses. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition
premia in acquisition transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2012 through October 21, 2022,
involving a public company in the biopharmaceutical industry as the target in a minority squeeze out transaction
where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was over $500 million. For the entire period, using publicly
available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median premium of the final price paid in the selected
transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to public announcement of the initial bid
of the acquirer. This analysis indicated a high, median and low premium, rounded to the nearest tenth, of 102.6%,
59.5% and 41.1%, respectively, across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of
illustrative premiums of 41.1% to 102.6% to the undisturbed closing price per Myovant common share of $17.96 as of
September 30, 2022, and calculated a range of implied equity values per Myovant common share of $25.34 to $36.39.

Goldman Sachs also reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia in
acquisition transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2012 through October 21, 2022, involving
a public company as the target in a minority squeeze out transaction where the disclosed enterprise value for the
transaction was over $1 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated
the median premium of the final price paid in the selected transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing
stock price prior to public announcement of the initial bid of the acquirer. This analysis indicated a high, median and
low premium, rounded to the nearest tenth, of 45.3%, 37.4% and 15.2%, respectively, across the period. Using this
analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 15% to 45% to the undisturbed closing
price per Myovant common share of $17.96 as of September 30, 2022, and calculated a range of implied equity values
per Myovant common share of $20.65 to $26.04. The following table presents the analyzed transactions:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In
arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.
No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Myovant,
Sumitovant or the contemplated Merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs providing its opinion to the Special
Committee as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be
paid to the Minority Shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be
appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses
based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject
to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective
advisors, none of Myovant, Sumitovant, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results
are materially different from those forecasts.
The per share merger consideration was determined through negotiations between Sumitovant and the Special
Committee. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the Special Committee during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did
not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Special Committee or that any specific amount
of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
As described in the section above entitled “-Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee
and the Myovant Board; Fairness of the Merger,” Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Special Committee was one of many
factors taken into consideration by the Special Committee in making its determination to approve the Merger
Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written
opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales
and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for
various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they
manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time
purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,
currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of Myovant, Sumitovant, any of their respective
affiliates and third parties, including Sumitomo Chemical, the parent company of SMP, and its affiliates or any
currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman
Sachs acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee in connection with, and participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to, the Merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting
services to Myovant and its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs
has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as Myovant’s financial advisor in connection
with the licensing of ORGOVYX® commercialization rights in certain territories in May 2022. During the two-year
period ended October 23, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation from Myovant for financial advisory
and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Myovant and/or to its affiliates of
approximately $5 million. During the two-year period ended October 23, 2022, the Investment Banking Division of
Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by Sumitovant or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting
services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman Sachs may in the future provide financial
advisory and/or underwriting services to Myovant, Sumitovant, SMP and their respective affiliates for which the
Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.
The Special Committee selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to
a letter agreement dated April 29, 2022, the Special Committee engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor
in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter among Myovant, the Special Committee and Goldman Sachs
provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of announcement, at approximately $38.9 million, with the possibility of an additional fee, payable at the sole
discretion of the Special Committee, of 0.5% of the aggregate consideration paid, all of which is contingent upon
consummation of the Merger. In addition, Myovant has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its
expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against
various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
Other Written Presentations by Goldman Sachs
In addition to the presentation made to the Special Committee on October 23, 2022 described above under “-
Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,” Goldman Sachs also made various preliminary presentations to the Special
Committee on June 28, 2022, August 3, 2022, August 22, 2022, October 1, 2022, October 21, 2022 and October 22, 2022.
Copies of the written preliminary presentations and a copy of the presentation made to the Special Committee on
October 23, 2022 have been filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed
Merger. These written preliminary presentations and the presentation made to the Special Committee on October 23,
2022 will be available to any interested shareholder of Myovant (or any representative of a shareholder who has been
so designated in writing) to inspect and copy at Myovant’s principal executive offices during regular business hours.
None of the various preliminary presentations to the Special Committee, alone or together, constitute, or form
the basis for, an opinion of Goldman Sachs. Information contained in the various preliminary presentations is
substantially similar to the information provided in Goldman Sachs’ oral and written presentation to the Special
Committee on October 23, 2022, as described above under “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.” A summary of
the written preliminary presentations is provided below. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a
complete description of the written preliminary presentations or of the preliminary financial analyses performed by
Goldman Sachs.

Sumitovant retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with its consideration of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Sumitovant selected J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor because it is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In this capacity, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided
Sumitovant with certain financial advisory services. Although J.P. Morgan generally acted as financial advisor to
Sumitovant, J.P. Morgan was not requested to provide, and did not provide, to Sumitovant, any other Purchaser
Filing Person, Myovant, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any Purchaser
Filing Person or Myovant, or any other person (i) any report, opinion or appraisal as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view or otherwise, of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the per share merger
consideration or any other term or aspect of any of the foregoing, (ii) any other valuation of any of the Purchaser
Filing Persons or Myovant for the purpose of assessing the fairness of the per share merger consideration to any
such person or (iii) any advice as to the underlying decision by any Purchaser Filing Person to engage in the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Because J.P. Morgan was not requested to, and did not, deliver
a fairness opinion in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, J.P. Morgan did not
perform financial analyses with a view towards those analyses supporting a fairness opinion. At various times during
the course of J.P. Morgan’s engagement as financial advisor to Sumitovant, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed
with Sumitovant various considerations with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including what financial analyses would be helpful to Sumitovant, and J.P. Morgan produced various financial
analyses during the course of its engagement.
The discussion materials prepared by representatives of J.P. Morgan for use in discussions with Sumitovant (the
“J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials”) have been filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Schedule 13E-3, including the J.P.
Morgan Discussion Materials, may be examined at, and copies may be obtained from, the SEC in the manner
described under “Where You Can Find Additional Information.” The information in the J.P. Morgan Discussion
Materials is subject to, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
limitations, qualifications and other conditions contained therein and is necessarily based on economic, monetary,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such
materials. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials are not intended to be and do not constitute a
48TABLE OF CONTENTS
recommendation to any Purchaser Filing Person, Myovant, or any other entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or any other matter. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials do not
constitute, and are not intended to represent, any view, opinion, report or appraisal as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view or otherwise, of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the per share merger
consideration to any Purchaser Filing Person, the Myovant shareholders or any other person.
Below is a summary of the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials, which is qualified in its entirety by the full
contents of the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials. The below summary presents the material analyses conducted by
J.P. Morgan and provided to Sumitovant, as well as the material assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations, qualifications and other conditions to the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials, but does not
purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan or the underlying
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations, qualifications and other conditions
contained therein, nor does the order of analyses or materials represent relative importance or weight given to those
analyses or materials by J.P. Morgan. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials were not appraisals of the business of
Myovant or the actual value that may be received in connection with the transaction, and did not take into account
the potential effects of the transaction. The preparation of financial analyses is a complex analytical process
involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, financial analyses are not readily
susceptible to summary description. J.P. Morgan considered the results of all analyses undertaken and assessed as a
whole, and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis.
Considering the summaries set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying these analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials.
The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials were provided solely for the benefit of Sumitovant for its information and
assistance in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The J.P.
Morgan Discussion Materials do not themselves convey rights or remedies upon the holders of any class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of any Purchaser Filing Person, Myovant or any other person (other than
Sumitovant).
In connection with the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials, J.P. Morgan reviewed, among other things, certain
publicly available historical business and financial information concerning Myovant, certain publicly available
information about select prior going-private merger transactions and certain non-public information regarding the
business and prospects of Myovant prepared by management of Myovant and approved for J.P. Morgan’s use by
Sumitovant. J.P. Morgan also reviewed certain financial analyses and forecasts concerning Myovant prepared by
Sumitovant and approved for J.P. Morgan’s use by Sumitovant, which were solely based on then-publicly available
business and financial information about Myovant. J.P. Morgan assumed and relied, without independent
verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of such information. J.P. Morgan also considered such other
factors as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate.
J.P. Morgan assumed with the consent of Sumitovant that the financial analyses and forecasts for Myovant
prepared by the management of Myovant were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgment of the management of Myovant, and that the financial analyses prepared by Sumitovant were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgment of Sumitovant, in each
case as of the date of the analysis or forecast. With respect to any financial forecasts, projections, other estimates
and other forward-looking information provided to or otherwise obtained by J.P. Morgan from public sources, data
suppliers and other third parties, J.P. Morgan assumed that such forecasts, projections, other estimates and
information were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
preparer as to, and were a reasonable and reliable basis upon which to evaluate, the matters covered thereby. J.P.
Morgan expressed no view as to any of the foregoing financial forecasts, projections, other estimates and other
forward-looking information or the assumptions on which they were based. No representation or warranty, express or
implied, was made by J.P. Morgan in relation to the accuracy or completeness of the information presented in the J.P.
Morgan Discussion Materials or their suitability for any particular purpose.
J.P. Morgan expressed no view, opinion, representation, guaranty or warranty (in each case, express or implied)
regarding the reasonableness or achievability of any financial forecasts, projections, other estimates or other
forward-looking information provided to, obtained or otherwise reviewed by, or discussed with,
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
J.P. Morgan, or the assumptions upon which they are based. J.P. Morgan did not conduct, and were not provided
with, any independent valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other
off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Myovant or any other company or business, nor did J.P. Morgan make any
physical inspection of the properties or assets of Myovant or any other company or business. J.P. Morgan did not
express any view with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters and relied, with Sumitovant’s
consent, upon the assessments of representatives of Myovant as to such matters.
J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the prices at which Myovant common shares will trade at any time, or as
to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Purchaser Filing Persons,
Myovant or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or as to the impact of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement on the solvency or viability of the Purchaser Filing Persons or Myovant or
the ability of the Purchaser Filing Persons or Myovant to pay their respective obligations when they come due. The
matters considered by J.P. Morgan in their financial analyses and reflected in the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials
were necessarily based on various assumptions, including assumptions concerning general business, economic and
capital markets conditions and industry-specific and company-specific factors as in effect on, and information made
available to J.P. Morgan as of the date of such J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials. Many such conditions are beyond
the control of the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant and J.P. Morgan. Accordingly, the financial analyses included
in the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials are inherently subject to uncertainty, and neither of J.P. Morgan nor any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are different from those forecasted. Furthermore, it should be
understood that subsequent developments may affect the views expressed in the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials
and that J.P. Morgan do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm their financial analyses or the J.P.
Morgan Discussion Materials based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of such J.P.
Morgan Discussion Materials. With respect to the financial analyses performed by J.P. Morgan in the J.P. Morgan
Discussion Materials, such financial analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. While none of the selected
precedent transactions used in the precedent minority squeeze-out analysis are identical to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and while none of the selected companies involved in such transactions are
identical or directly comparable to Myovant, the transactions were selected because they involved publicly traded
companies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Myovant
based on the familiarity of J.P. Morgan with the biopharmaceutical industry. Such financial analyses do not purport to
be reports, appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares or other securities or financial instruments of or relating
to the Myovant common shares may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.
The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials are not, and should not be viewed as, a recommendation with respect to
any matter pertaining to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The terms of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the per share merger consideration, were determined solely
through negotiations between the parties to the Merger Agreement. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials did not
address the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any other transactions
contemplated in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement compared to other
business strategies or transactions that may have been considered by the management of the Purchaser Filing
Persons.
September 27 Materials
On September 27, 2022, at Sumitovant’s request, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided Sumitovant with

performance, as well as preliminary financial analyses of the range of illustrative per Myovant common share values
implied by Myovant’s 52-week high and low closing share prices, certain precedent minority squeeze-out premiums,
wall street price targets and a discounted cash follow analysis. The 52-week trading price had ranged from $23.87
(11/03/2021) to $7.78 (05/09/2022). The September 27 materials included a summary of the premiums paid in 19 U.S. all-
cash minority squeeze-out transactions announced between March 2010 and June 2022. The transactions analyzed

The median and average premium paid relative to the undisturbed price one day prior to first public offer in
these transactions were 47.2% and 54.8%, respectively. Applying premiums of 20% and 65% against the then-current
market price of $16.82, implied a premiums paid range of $20.00 to $28.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.50). The
September 27 materials also showed that, in the precedent minority squeeze-out transactions, an acquiror increased
its final offer an average of 15.6% above its initial offer. The discounted cash flow analysis prepared based on the
Sumitovant management projections (as defined in the section entitled “Special Factors-Projected Financial
Information-SMP Financial Information and Projections”) indicated an illustrative range per Myovant common share
of $22.50 (using a 12.25% discount rate) to $29.50 (using an 8.25% discount rate) (rounded to the nearest $0.50).
The September 27 materials also include a summary of Myovant’s pro forma capitalization at illustrative per
Myovant common share offer prices ranging from $20.00 to $30.00. The analysis indicated the premiums implied by
such illustrative offer prices to Myovant’s then-current per Myovant common share price of $16.82, to Myovant’s 52-
week high and low closing share price, and to Myovant’s VWAP over the trailing 30, 60 and 90 trading days. The

Miscellaneous
As described above, J.P. Morgan was not asked to, and did not, render any opinion, report or appraisal as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view or otherwise, of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
the per share merger consideration to the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant, the holders of any class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of the Purchaser Filing Persons or Myovant. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials
were one of many factors taken into consideration by Sumitovant in its deliberations in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of these analyses as a
whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses. As a result, any potential
indications of valuation resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were
merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes. The order of analyses described does not
represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In preparing the J.P. Morgan
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discussion Materials, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered and
did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation,
supported or failed to support the analysis set forth in the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials. Rather, J.P. Morgan
considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in preparing the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials.
Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be reports, appraisals or otherwise reflective of the
prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected transactions referred to in the
above summaries is identical to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and no company used in
the aforementioned analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Myovant. However, the transactions were
chosen because they involve transactions that, for purposes of the analysis of J.P. Morgan, may be considered
similar to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The analyses necessarily involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to Myovant.
J.P. Morgan did not recommend any specific merger consideration to the Purchaser Filing Persons or that any
specific amount constituted the only appropriate merger consideration for the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.
J.P. Morgan and its respective affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,
sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for
various persons and entities. J.P. Morgan and its respective affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they
manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests, or with which they co-invest, may at any time
purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,
currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant and any of
their respective affiliates and third parties, including affiliates of the holders of Myovant common stock, or any
currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, for the
accounts of J.P. Morgan and their respective affiliates, employees and customers.
By letter agreement, dated February 18, 2022 (the “J.P. Morgan Engagement Letter”), Sumitovant engaged J.P.
Morgan to act as its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the J.P. Morgan Engagement Letter, J.P. Morgan will receive a fee from Sumitovant of approximately $10
million if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated. In addition, Sumitovant has
agreed to indemnify J.P. Morgan for certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement and to reimburse J.P.
Morgan for certain of their expenses. During the two years prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, J.P.
Morgan and its affiliates have had other commercial or investment banking relationships with Sumitovant, for which
J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have received fees of approximately $350,000. During the two years prior to the execution
of the Merger Agreement, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with
Myovant, for which J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have received fees of approximately $250,000. In the ordinary course
of business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments
(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant, other parties
involved in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and their respective affiliates, as applicable, for
their own account or for the account of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position or otherwise effect transactions in such securities or financial instruments.
Purposes and Reasons of the Purchaser Filing Persons for the Merger
Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, including Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, the
Purchaser Filing Persons are deemed to be “affiliates” of Myovant and engaged in a “going-private” transaction, and
therefore, may be required to disclose its purposes and reasons for the Merger to Myovant’s “unaffiliated security
holders” as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act. The Purchaser Filing Persons are making the
statements included in this section solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and
related rules under the Exchange Act. However, the Purchaser Filing Persons are not making any recommendation to
any Minority Shareholder as to how that shareholder should vote on any proposal, and the views of each of the
Purchaser Filing Persons should not be construed as a recommendation to any Minority Shareholder as to how such
shareholder should vote. The Purchaser Filing Persons have interests in the Merger that are different from those of
the Minority Shareholders.
If the Merger is completed, Myovant will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitovant. As a result, the
Myovant common shares will cease to be listed on the NYSE or publicly traded and will be deregistered under
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Exchange Act. Except as otherwise determined by Sumitovant and notified in writing to Myovant at least five
business days prior to the effective time, upon completion of the Merger (i) the board of directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the effective time will become the board of directors of Myovant and (ii) the officers of Myovant
immediately prior to the effective time will remain in place as the officers of Myovant following completion of the
Merger.
For the Purchaser Filing Persons, the purpose of the Merger is to enable (i) Sumitovant to acquire 100%
ownership and control of Myovant in a transaction in which holders of Myovant common shares (other than
Myovant common shares held by (a) Dissenting Holders, (b) Sumitovant or (c) Myovant or its wholly owned
subsidiaries) will receive $27.00 per Myovant common share, and (ii) the Purchaser Filing Persons to own 100% of the
equity interests in Myovant after the Merger. In this regard, the Purchaser Filing Persons will bear the risks and
rewards of such ownership in Myovant after the Merger, including any future earnings and growth of Myovant as a
result of improvements to Myovant’s operations, synergies that may result from the Merger, acquisitions of other
businesses, successful commercialization of ORGOVYX®, MYFEMBREE® and RYEQO®, as well as the successful
clinical development and regulatory approval of other product candidates and other benefits of operating Myovant.
The Purchaser Filing Persons determined that the structuring of the transaction as a merger in which the
Minority Shareholders receive $27.00 in cash for each Myovant common share is preferable to other transaction
structures as it provides the holders of Myovant common shares (other than Myovant common shares held by (a)
Dissenting Holders, (b) Sumitovant or (c) Myovant or its wholly owned subsidiaries) with immediate liquidity for
their Myovant common shares through their receipt of the per share merger consideration, which represents a
premium of approximately 50% to the closing price per Myovant common share on September 30, 2022 (the last
trading day prior to Sumitovant’s initial non-binding proposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that
Sumitovant does not already own, on which date the closing price was $17.96) and a premium of approximately 55%
to the 60-calendar day VWAP per Myovant common share through September 30, 2022 (which was $17.38).
Conversely, as a result of the Merger, the Minority Shareholders will no longer have an opportunity to participate in
any future benefits associated with the ownership of the Myovant common shares, including the receipt of any
dividends from Myovant in the future and participation in any potential appreciation in the trading price of the
Myovant common shares beyond the per share merger consideration. The Minority Shareholders’ receipt of cash in
exchange for their Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes to the Minority Shareholders who are U.S. Holders.
In addition, the Purchaser Filing Persons believe that structuring the transaction in such a manner is preferable
to other alternative transaction structures because it (i) will enable the Purchaser Filing Persons to directly acquire all
of the outstanding shares of Myovant not beneficially owned by them at the same time, (ii) will allow Myovant to
cease to be a public reporting company, reducing management time and attention spent on those activities, as well as
operating costs, (iii) will allow the Purchaser Filing Persons to control and determine investment strategies, reduce
commercial and execution risk in connection with the development and commercialization of ORGOVYX® and
MYFEMBREE® and other future drug candidates, and (iv) is consistent with recent precedent transactions. Because
the transaction structure is consistent with the objectives of the Purchaser Filing Persons and with market practice,
the Purchaser Filing Persons did not pursue or propose an alternative transaction structure.
In deciding to pursue the Merger, the Purchaser Filing Persons considered and took into account various risks
and other factors that potentially could adversely affect them. These included the possibility that the Merger could
result in the loss of key employees of Myovant or otherwise disrupt Myovant’s business operations. The Purchaser
Filing Persons also considered that its directors, officers and other employees would expend considerable time and
effort in negotiating, implementing and completing the Merger, and in doing so their time would be diverted from
other important business opportunities and operational matters. The Purchaser Filing Persons recognized that it
would incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with the Merger, regardless of whether the
Merger is completed. There is a risk that the Merger may not be completed despite the Purchaser Filing Persons’
efforts, including in the event that the approval by a majority of the outstanding Myovant common shares held by
the Minority Shareholders is not obtained. Although each of the Purchaser
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Filing Persons believes that there will be significant opportunities associated with their investment in Myovant, the
Purchaser Filing Persons realize that there are also substantial risks (including the risks and uncertainties relating to
the prospects of Myovant and as described in this paragraph) and that such opportunities may not be fully realized
on the expected timeframe or at all.
The Purchaser Filing Persons believe that after the Merger is consummated, Myovant should have greater
operating flexibility and more efficient access to capital, which should support Myovant’s long-term growth and
profitability, including due to (i) the reduction in expenses resulting from Myovant ceasing to be a public company,
(ii) the ability of the Purchaser Filing Persons to efficiently provide certain administrative functions to Myovant and
(iii) greater operational flexibility for Myovant to pursue alternatives than it would have as a public company,
including the ability to pursue transactions without focusing on the reaction of the market or of the Minority
Shareholders to such transactions or the collective risk tolerance of such Minority Shareholders as it relates to such
transactions. If that happens, the Purchaser Filing Persons (and not the Minority Shareholders) will benefit from any
resulting increase in the value of Myovant. Accordingly, the Purchaser Filing Persons have decided to undertake to
pursue the Merger at this time for the reasons described above.
If the Merger is not completed for any reason, SMP, Sumitovant and their affiliates reserve the right, subject to
the Investor Rights Agreement, to acquire additional Myovant common shares through private purchases, market
transactions, tender or exchange offers or otherwise on terms and at prices that may be more or less favorable than
those provided in the Merger Agreement, or, subject to any applicable legal restrictions, to dispose of any or all
Myovant common shares acquired by them. In the event that the Merger is not completed, then the Investor Rights
Agreement will remain in place in accordance with its terms.
Position of the Purchaser Filing Persons as to Fairness of the Merger
Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, including Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, the
Purchaser Filing Persons are deemed to be “affiliates” of Myovant and engaged in a “going-private” transaction and,
therefore may be required to disclose its beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to Myovant’s “unaffiliated security
holders” as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act. Each Purchaser Filing Person is making the statements
included in this section of this proxy statement solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Rule
13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. However, no Purchaser Filing Person is making any recommendation
to any Minority Shareholder as to how that shareholder should vote on any proposal, and the views of each of
Purchaser Filing Persons should not be construed as a recommendation to any Minority Shareholder as to how such
shareholder should vote. Each Purchaser Filing Person has interests in the Merger that are different from those of the
Minority Shareholders.
The Purchaser Filing Persons believe that the Special Committee, which negotiated the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, including the Merger, with the
assistance of the independent financial advisor and legal counsel selected and retained by the Special Committee,
represented the interests of the Minority Shareholders. While the members of the Purchaser Filing Persons are
represented by the Sumitomo Directors on the Myovant Board, the Merger was negotiated and approved by the
Special Committee. The Sumitomo Directors are not members of the Special Committee and did not participate in the
deliberations of the Special Committee regarding, or receive advice from the Special Committee’s independent legal or
financial advisors as to, the substantive and procedural fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders. The
Sumitomo Directors, in their capacity as members of the Myovant Board, also recused themselves from
determinations related to a potential transaction with Sumitovant and SMP due to their affiliation with Sumitovant
and/or SMP. The Purchaser Filing Persons did not undertake, or engage a financial advisor to undertake, any
valuation or other independent analysis for the purpose of assessing the fairness of the Merger or the per share
merger consideration to the Minority Shareholders.
However, the Purchaser Filing Persons believe, based on the knowledge and analysis by the Purchaser Filing
Persons of available information regarding Myovant and the factors considered by, and the analysis and resulting
conclusions of, the Special Committee described in the section entitled “Special Factors-Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board; Fairness of the Merger” (which analysis and
resulting conclusions the Purchaser Filing Persons adopt, based on Purchaser Filing Persons’ review thereof
subsequent to the execution of the Merger Agreement), that the Merger is substantively and procedurally fair to the
Minority Shareholders.
55
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In particular, the Purchaser Filing Persons considered the following substantive factors, among others, which
are not presented in any relative order of importance:
•
the current and historical market prices of the Myovant common shares, and the fact that the $27.00 per
share merger consideration represents (i) a premium of approximately 50% to the closing price of the
Myovant common shares on September 30, 2022 (the last trading day prior to Sumitovant’s initial non-
binding proposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own,
on which date the closing price was $17.96), and (ii) a premium of approximately 55% based on the 60-
calendar day VWAP of the Myovant common shares through September 30, 2022 (which was $17.38);
•
the per share merger consideration is all cash, which provides immediate certainty of value and liquidity to
the Minority Shareholders, since such shareholders are able to realize the $27.00 per share merger
consideration for each of their Myovant common shares;
•
the Special Committee received an opinion from Goldman Sachs, dated October 23, 2022, as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view and as of such date to the Minority Shareholders of the $27.00 per share
merger consideration to be paid to such holders in connection with the Merger, which opinion was based
upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein as more fully described in the section
entitled “Special Factors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee,” notwithstanding that the
opinion of Goldman Sachs was provided for the information and assistance of the Special Committee and
none of the Purchaser Filing Persons are entitled to, and did not, rely on such opinion;
•
the Merger will eliminate the Minority Shareholders’ exposure to the various risks and uncertainties related
to continued ownership of Myovant common shares, which include among others:
•
exposure to risks and uncertainties relating to the successful commercialization of ORGOVYX® and
MYFEMBREE®, as well as the successful clinical development and regulatory approval of other
product candidates;
•
exposure to market, economic and other risks that arise from owning shares in a public company;
•
any potential decline in the market prices of the Myovant common shares that may result from a
general economic slowdown;
•
other fluctuations in the value of the Myovant common shares based on general economic, business
and industry conditions throughout the world;
•
potential volatility in the price of the Myovant common shares as a result of future developments
beyond Myovant’s control, including government or regulatory action, and changes in tax laws,
interest rates and general market conditions;
•
potential impacts on the price and trading volumes of the Myovant common shares caused by analyst
recommendations and expectations and market sentiment; and
•
the other risk factors disclosed in Myovant’s most recent SEC filings.
•
Sumitovant’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to complete the Merger and pay the aggregate per share merger
consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement are not conditioned on their obtaining financing; and
•
SMP has agreed to irrevocably guarantee to Myovant the due and punctual payment of all amounts
payable by Sumitovant or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, including Sumitovant’s and Merger
Sub’s obligation to fund the aggregate per share merger consideration that is payable to the Minority
Shareholders.
In addition, the Purchaser Filing Persons considered the following procedural factors, which are not presented
in any relative order of importance:
•
under the Investor Rights Agreement, the Purchaser Filing Persons are subject to various restrictions on
their ability to influence or control the Myovant Board, including a contractual restriction, until
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
December 27, 2022, requiring the Purchaser Filing Persons to obtain the approval of Myovant’s Audit
Committee before making or publicly announcing a proposal for a merger, which gave the Audit Committee
the authority to pursue, or decline to pursue, negotiations with the Purchaser Filing Persons relating to a
sale of Myovant, including the Merger;
•
the Myovant Board established the Special Committee comprised solely of independent directors who are
not affiliated with the Purchaser Filing Persons and who are not officers or employees of Myovant, and
who are independent and disinterested with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, to
consider the Purchaser Filing Persons’ proposal and to negotiate with the Purchaser Filing Persons;
•
the Special Committee was advised by experienced and qualified outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, consisting of Skadden, as its legal counsel, Conyers, as its Bermuda legal counsel, and Goldman
Sachs, as its financial advisor;
•
the authorization of the Special Committee to, among other things, (i) review and consider whether it would
be appropriate and desirable for Myovant to enter into a potential transaction with Sumitovant, (ii) develop,
assess and negotiate the terms of a potential transaction with Sumitovant and alternatives thereto and (iii)
make a recommendation to the full Myovant Board as to whether Myovant should enter into such potential
transaction;
•
the Sumitovant Board and the Purchaser Filing Persons were advised by experienced and qualified outside
legal counsel and financial advisor, consisting of Sullivan & Cromwell, as legal counsel, and J.P. Morgan, as
financial advisor;
•
the Merger is conditioned on the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Myovant
common shares held by the Minority Shareholders, in addition to the approval of the holders of at least a
majority of the aggregate voting rights of the issued and outstanding Myovant common shares entitled to
vote and voting at the special general meeting;
•
the Merger Agreement allows the Special Committee, subject to specific limitations and requirements set
forth in the Merger Agreement, to withdraw its recommendation in favor of the Merger Proposal in
response to a superior proposal or intervening event, subject to Myovant paying the Purchaser Filing
Persons the termination fee of $55,250,000 in the case of an actual termination of the Merger Agreement;
•
the Special Committee was deliberative in its process to determine whether the Merger was fair to, and in
the best interests of, Myovant and its shareholders (including the Minority Shareholders) and to analyze,
evaluate and negotiate the terms of the Merger;
•
the Purchaser Filing Persons did not participate in or have any influence on the deliberative process of, or
the conclusions reached by, the Special Committee or the negotiating positions of the Special Committee;
•
the Purchaser Filing Persons’ obligation to consummate the Merger is not conditioned on any financing
being obtained by the Purchaser Filing Persons, which increases the likelihood that the Merger will be
consummated and that the Minority Shareholders will receive the per share merger consideration of $27.00;
•
at the request of the Special Committee, Sumitovant entered into the Sumitovant Voting Agreement
pursuant to which and consistent with the Merger Agreement, Sumitovant is required to vote all Myovant
common shares that it or its affiliates (other than Myovant and its subsidiaries) beneficially own in favor of
the Merger, with such obligation being applicable even if the Purchaser Filing Persons no longer wish to
consummate the Merger, which increases the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated and that the
Minority Shareholders will receive the per share merger consideration of $27.00;
•
the per share merger consideration resulted from extensive negotiations between the Special Committee and
the Purchaser Filing Persons and their respective advisors;
•
the Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors, who recused themselves from determinations
related to a potential transaction with Sumitovant due to their affiliation with Sumitovant and/or SMP),
acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, (i) determined that the per share
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
merger consideration constitutes fair value for each Myovant common share in accordance with the
Bermuda Companies Act, (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory
Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Myovant
and its shareholders (including “unaffiliated security holders,” as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act), (iii) approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the
Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting
Agreement, and (iv) subject to the right of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) to change their recommendations in certain circumstances
specified in the Merger Agreement, determined to recommend that Myovant’s shareholders vote in favor
of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and
the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, at a duly held meeting of Myovant’s shareholders for such purpose;
and
•
the Minority Shareholders who do not vote for the Merger and who comply with certain procedural
requirements will be entitled, after completion of the Merger, to exercise statutory appraisal rights under
Bermuda law.
In the course of reaching their determination as to the fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders, the
Purchaser Filing Persons also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the Merger
Agreement and the Merger, including the following:
•
the fact that the Minority Shareholders will have no ongoing equity participation in Myovant following the
Merger and that those Minority Shareholders will (i) cease to participate in Myovant’s future earnings or
growth, if any, (ii) not benefit from increases, if any, in the value of the Myovant common shares and (iii)
not benefit from any potential sale to a third party in the future, including any of the foregoing that may
result from a successful launch and commercialization of ORGOVYX® and MYFEMBREE®;
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or that the Merger might not be
consummated at all as a result of a failure to satisfy the conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, and
the fact that a failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the trading price of Myovant or could
result in significant costs and disruptions to Myovant’s normal business;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Myovant’s business prior to the completion of the proposed Merger,
which may delay or prevent Myovant from undertaking business opportunities that may arise and certain
other actions it might otherwise take with respect to the operations of Myovant pending completion of the
Merger;
•
the fact that the Merger is conditioned upon the approval of at least a majority of the outstanding Myovant
common shares held by the Minority Shareholders, which reduces the certainty that the Merger will be
completed;
•
the fact that litigation may occur in connection with the Merger and any such litigation may result in
significant costs and a diversion of management focus;
•
the risk, if the Merger is not consummated, that the pendency of the Merger could adversely affect the
relationship of Myovant and its subsidiaries with their respective employees, suppliers, agents and others
with whom they have business dealings;
•
the fact that Sumitovant, in making its proposal to engage in the Merger, indicated that it is not interested
in considering or participating in any transaction involving a sale of its Myovant common shares and that
Sumitovant’s current beneficial ownership of the outstanding Myovant common shares, which is
approximately 51.5% as of January 17, 2023, would discourage the making of a competing acquisition
proposal from third parties;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement
until the effective time of the Merger, Myovant is subject to certain restrictions on its
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide non-public information
to third parties and to engage in negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals,
subject to customary exceptions;
•
the fact that Myovant has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in
connection with the potential transaction, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated;
•
the risk related to amounts that may be payable by Myovant upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement, including the termination fee of $55,250,000, and the process required to terminate the Merger;
and
•
the fact that the receipt of per share merger consideration in exchange for each Myovant common share
pursuant to the Merger generally will be taxable to U.S. Holders (as defined below in the section entitled “-
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) of Myovant common shares.
The Purchaser Filing Persons did not consider net book value, which is an accounting concept, for purposes of
determining the substantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders because the Purchaser Filing
Persons believed that net book value is neither indicative of Myovant’s market value nor its value as a going
concern, but rather an indicator of historical costs.
In addition, the Purchaser Filing Persons did not conduct a going-concern valuation of the Myovant common
shares for purposes of determining the substantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders because,
following the Merger, Myovant will have a significantly different capital structure and because the Purchaser Filing
Persons believe that the trading price of Myovant common shares at any given time represents the best available
indicator of Myovant’s going-concern value at that time, so long as the trading price at that time is not impacted by
speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction.
Moreover, the Purchaser Filing Persons did not consider the liquidation value of Myovant in determining the
substantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders because (i) of their belief that liquidation sales
generally result in proceeds substantially less than the sales of a going concern, (ii) of the impracticability of
determining a liquidation value given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup, (iii) they considered
Myovant to be a viable going concern and (iv) the Purchaser Filing Persons anticipate that Myovant’s operations
will continue to be conducted substantially as they currently are being conducted.
Finally, the Purchaser Filing Persons did not consider the purchase prices of Myovant common shares paid by
the Purchaser Filing Persons in previous purchases of Myovant common shares during the two years preceding the
signing of the Merger Agreement in determining the substantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders
because they did not consider those prices to represent the best available indicator of Myovant’s pre-Merger value
but rather to be indicative of historical prices, as described above.
In making their determination as to the substantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders, the
Purchaser Filing Persons were not aware of any firm offers having been received by Myovant from anyone other than
the Purchaser Filing Persons in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement for (i) the merger or
consolidation of Myovant with another company, (ii) the sale or transfer of all or any substantial part of Myovant’s
assets or (iii) a purchase of Myovant’s securities that would enable the holder to exercise control of Myovant.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Purchaser Filing
Persons in connection with the fairness of the Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but includes all factors
considered by the Purchaser Filing Persons that they believe to be material. The Purchaser Filing Persons did not find
it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the individual factors considered in
reaching their conclusions as to the fairness of the Merger. Rather, the fairness determinations were made after
consideration of all of the foregoing factors as a whole. The Purchaser Filing Persons believe these factors provide a
reasonable basis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the Minority
Shareholders. This position should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any Minority Shareholder to
approve the Merger Agreement. The Purchaser Filing Persons make no recommendation as to how the Minority
Shareholders of Myovant should vote their shares relating to the Merger. The Purchaser Filing Persons attempted to
negotiate the terms of a transaction that would be most favorable to them, and not to the Minority Shareholders, and,
accordingly, did not negotiate the Merger Agreement with a goal of obtaining terms that were fair to such Minority
Shareholders.

The consummation of the Merger is not conditioned upon the Purchaser Filing Persons obtaining the proceeds
of any financing.
Myovant and the Purchaser Filing Persons estimate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the
Merger to be approximately $1.7 billion as of the date of this proxy statement, assuming no exercise of dissenters’
rights by shareholders of Myovant (the “Aggregate Consideration”). This amount includes the cash to be paid to the
Minority Shareholders and to the holders of various equity-based compensation awards and warrants, the repayment
of certain existing indebtedness of Myovant, as well as the related costs and expenses as more fully described in the
section entitled “Special Factors-Fees and Expenses,” in connection with the Merger.
The Aggregate Consideration will be funded through a combination of proceeds from debt financing and cash
on hand of SMP, which will be funded in turn to Sumitovant to pay the Aggregate Consideration.
Acquisition Debt Financing
SMP has obtained debt financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Facility Commitment Letter,
pursuant to which the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (“SMBC”) has provided commitments in respect of a
senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate amount of the JPY equivalent of US$1.7 billion (the “Facility”), the
proceeds of which will be used, together with cash on hand of SMP, for the purpose of financing (i) the Aggregate
Consideration, (ii) the repayment of certain existing indebtedness of Myovant and its subsidiaries and (iii) fees and
expenses incurred in connection therewith.
Terms of the Facility
•
Interest Rate. The Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to JPY TIBOR (“Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate”)
for a one-month term plus 0.60% per annum; provided that (i) if JPY TIBOR for a one-month term is less
than zero, it shall be deemed to be zero and (ii) interest will be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year and
actual number of days elapsed.
•
Maturity. The Facility will mature, and all obligations thereunder will become due and payable, on the date
that is 12 months after the date of the initial funding of the Facility (such date, the “Drawdown Date”).
•
Conditions Precedent. The initial funding of the Facility is subject to satisfaction (or waiver) of certain
conditions, among other things, (a) SMBC having received certain documentation and information about
SMP and its subsidiaries mutually agreed to be required by regulatory authorities under applicable “know-
your-customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, (b) certain specified representations set
forth in the Facility Commitment Letter being true and correct in all material respects as of the Drawdown
Date, (c) there being no material breach of any provision of any definitive documentation governing the
terms of the Merger or the Facility, as applicable, by any party thereto (other than SMBC), (d) no certain
specified events of default are continuing, (e) all conditions precedent set out in the Merger Agreement
have been (or will, on the Closing Date, be) satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived, (f)
it not being illegal for SMBC to perform any of its obligations as contemplated by the definitive
documentation governing the terms of the Facility or to fund its participation under the Facility and (g)
SMBC’s receipt of customary officer’s certificates from SMP.
The foregoing summary of the Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Facility Commitment Letter.

Following the completion of the Merger, the Purchaser Filing Persons will own 100% of the equity interests of
Myovant. The Purchaser Filing Persons anticipate that Myovant’s operations will continue to be conducted
substantially as they currently are being conducted.
Following the completion of the Merger and the delisting and deregistration with the SEC of Myovant common
shares, Myovant will no longer be subject to the NYSE listing rules or the Exchange Act, and may experience positive
effects on profitability as a result of the elimination of direct and indirect costs and expenses related to compliance
with such rules and regulations.
60TABLE OF CONTENTS
Except as otherwise determined by Sumitovant and notified in writing to Myovant at least five business days
prior to the effective time, upon completion of the Merger (i) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
effective time will be the directors of the surviving company following the effective time and (ii) Myovant’s officers
immediately prior to the effective time will be the officers of the surviving company following the effective time.
The Purchaser Filing Persons currently anticipate that Myovant’s operations will initially be conducted
following completion of the Merger substantially as they are currently being conducted (except that Myovant will
cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitovant). However, the Purchaser
Filing Persons are evaluating and will continue to evaluate Myovant’s assets, corporate capital structure,
capitalization, operations, businesses, properties and personnel with a view towards determining possible synergies
and the efficient allocation of resources in order to maximize Myovant’s long-term earnings potential as a private
company, which may include material changes in Myovant’s corporate structure and business.
Certain Effects of the Merger",70,71
Myovant Sciences Ltd._20230123_DEFM14A_20573637_4573939.Pdf,Certain Effects of the Merger,"Certain Effects of the Merger
If the Merger Proposal receives the required approvals of Myovant’s shareholders described elsewhere in this
proxy statement and the other conditions to the completion of the Merger are either satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Myovant upon the terms set forth in
the Merger Agreement with Myovant continuing as the surviving company. As the surviving company in the
Merger, Myovant will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitovant.
At the effective time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action, the memorandum of association
and the bye-laws of Merger Sub, each as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will become the
memorandum of association and bye-laws of the surviving company.
Following completion of the Merger, all of the equity interests in Myovant, as the surviving company, will be
beneficially owned by the Purchaser Filing Persons and none of the Minority Shareholders will, by virtue of the
Merger, have any direct ownership in, or be a shareholder of, Myovant, the surviving company or the Purchaser
Filing Persons. As a result, the Minority Shareholders will no longer benefit from any increase in the value, nor will
they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of Myovant common shares. Following the Merger, the Purchaser
Filing Persons will benefit from any increase in Myovant’s value and will also bear the risk of any decrease in
Myovant’s value.
At the effective time, each holder of Myovant common shares (other than Myovant common shares held by (i)
Dissenting Holders, (ii) Sumitovant or (iii) Myovant or its wholly owned subsidiaries) immediately prior to the
effective time will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration for each share held and all such Myovant
common shares will, at the effective time, be cancelled, be no longer outstanding, and automatically cease to exist.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Effect of the Merger on the Myovant
Common Shares and Merger Sub.”
For information regarding the effects of the Merger on Myovant’s outstanding equity awards, please see the
sections entitled “The Merger Agreement-Treatment of Myovant Equity Awards” and “Special Factors-Interests of
Myovant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The Myovant common shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act and trade on the NYSE under the
symbol “MYOV.” Following the completion of the Merger, the Myovant common shares will no longer be traded on
the NYSE or any other public market. In addition, the registration of the Myovant common shares under the
Exchange Act will be terminated, and Myovant will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the
SEC with respect to the Myovant common shares or otherwise. Termination of registration of the Myovant common
shares under the Exchange Act will reduce the information required to be furnished by Myovant to Myovant’s
shareholders and the SEC, and would make provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file annual
and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with shareholders’
meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to Myovant. Myovant will become the
beneficiary of the cost savings achieved by Myovant no longer remaining a company subject to the reporting
requirements under the federal securities laws.

Certain Effects of the Merger on the Purchaser Filing Persons
Following the consummation of the Merger, Sumitovant will own all of the equity interests of Myovant and be
the sole beneficiary of future earnings, growth and value, and will be the only shareholder entitled to vote on
corporate matters affecting Myovant.
Additionally, following the Merger, the Myovant common shares will be delisted from the NYSE, will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act and will cease to be publicly traded. See the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Special Factors-Plans for Myovant After the Merger.” As such, Myovant will be relieved of the
requirements applicable to public companies, including, among other things, the pressure to meet analyst forecasts
and the requirements and restrictions on trading that directors, officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of
the shares of the common shares face as a result of the provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Myovant will
also be relieved of the obligation to separately prepare and furnish information to its shareholders.
The primary detriments of the Merger to the Purchaser Filing Persons include the fact that all of the risk of any
possible decrease in the future earnings, growth or value of Myovant following the Merger will be borne by the
Purchaser Filing Persons. Additionally, the Purchaser Filing Persons’ ownership of Myovant will be illiquid, with no
public trading market for such securities.
The table below sets forth the beneficial ownership of Myovant common shares and resulting interests in
Myovant’s net book value and net loss of the Purchaser Filing Persons prior to and immediately after the
consummation of the Merger, based on Myovant’s net book value at September 30, 2022 and net loss for the six
months ended September 30, 2022, as if the Merger were completed on such date:

As noted above, in response to the proposed offer from Sumitovant, the Special Committee evaluated potential
strategic alternatives for Myovant, including continuing as a separate public company or pursuing an alternative
transaction with a third party, with the assistance of Myovant’s senior management and advisors. The Special
Committee considered the risks and potential likelihood of achieving greater value for the Minority Shareholders by
pursuing potential strategic alternatives to the Merger, including continuing as a separate public company or
pursuing an alternative transaction with a third party, in each case, relative to the benefits of the Merger. In this
regard, the Special Committee took into account that Sumitovant, as the holder of a majority of Myovant common
shares, has an effective veto over any alternative transaction, and that Sumitovant stated in its initial non-binding
proposal letter delivered on September 30, 2022 that it had no interest in selling any of the Myovant common shares it
owns nor approving any alternative sale, merger or similar transaction involving Myovant. For more information on
the process behind the Special Committee’s determination, please see the sections entitled “Special Factors-
Background of the Merger” and “Special Factors-Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee
and the Myovant Board; Fairness of the Merger.” Sumitovant has made the only firm offer to acquire Myovant that
Myovant received during the past two years.

Myovant Management Projections
Myovant does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term financial projections because of, among
other reasons, the uncertainty and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates and the unpredictability
of Myovant’s business and the competitive markets in which it operates. However, in connection with the Special
Committee’s evaluation of a potential transaction with Sumitovant, Myovant management prepared and provided to
62TABLE OF CONTENTS
representatives of Goldman Sachs, who then presented to the Special Committee on June 28, 2022, the Initial
Projections, related to periods from fiscal year 2022 to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2036 (“fiscal year 2035”). At
the direction of the Special Committee, the Initial Projections were revised by Myovant management and were
superseded by the Revised Projections, which reflect revised underlying assumptions as described below, related to
periods from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2036. The Revised Projections were initially presented to the Special
Committee at its meeting on August 3, 2022 and did not change thereafter. In this section of the proxy statement, we
refer to the Initial Projections and the Revised Projections together as the “Financial Projections.” The Financial
Projections are based on certain assumptions made by management, and were based on preliminary five-year
projections for the periods from fiscal year 2022 through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027 (“fiscal year 2026”)
that had been presented by management to the Myovant Board in March 2022 as part of Myovant’s regular long-
range planning process and were shared with J.P. Morgan. The Revised Projections were used by Goldman Sachs
with the Special Committee’s approval for purposes of preparing Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses and fairness
opinion provided to the Special Committee on October 23, 2022 in connection with the Special Committee’s
consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as more fully described in the section
entitled “Special Factors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee.”
The summary of the Financial Projections is included in this proxy statement because the Financial Projections
were made available to Goldman Sachs for the purpose of rendering an opinion that is materially related to the
proposed transaction with Sumitovant and SMP and are being disclosed in order to comply with the SEC rules or
requirements under applicable law, including case law regarding disclosure of the financial advisor’s analyses. The
Financial Projections included in this proxy statement, other than preliminary five-year projections that had been
presented by management to the Myovant Board in March 2022 and subsequently shared with J.P. Morgan, which
were subsequently incorporated into the Financial Projections, were not shared with the Purchaser Filing Persons or
their advisors prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement.
The Financial Projections were generated solely for internal use and not developed with a view toward public
disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the SEC
regarding forward-looking statements or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), but, in the view of
Myovant management, were reasonably prepared in good faith on a basis reflecting the best available estimates and
judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation. No independent registered public
accounting firm provided any assistance in preparing the Financial Projections. Accordingly, no independent
registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the
Financial Projections or expressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance with respect thereto, and they
assume no responsibility for the information contained in the Financial Projections. The Ernst & Young LLP report
included in Myovant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (“fiscal year 2021”)
relates solely to the historical financial information of Myovant and to an assessment of Myovant’s internal controls
over financial reporting. Such reports do not extend to the Financial Projections and should not be read to do so.
The inclusion of the Financial Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Myovant, Sumitovant or
their respective affiliates or financial advisors or any of their respective representatives or any other recipient of this
information considered, or now considers, the Financial Projections to be necessarily predictive of future results.
There can be no assurance that the projected results will be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower
or higher than estimated, whether or not the Merger is completed. None of Myovant, Sumitovant or their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not
differ from the Financial Projections, and, except as required by applicable law, none of Myovant, Sumitovant or their
respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Financial Projections to
reflect circumstances existing after the date the Financial Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of
future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Financial Projections are shown to
be inappropriate. None of Myovant or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or
makes any representation to any Myovant shareholder or other person regarding the information included in the
Financial Projections or Myovant’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Financial
Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved. Myovant has made no representation to Sumitovant, in the
Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Financial Projections. The Financial Projections are forward-looking
statements. The assumptions and estimates underlying the Financial Projections, all of which are difficult to predict
and many of which are beyond the control of Myovant, may not be realized. Neither Myovant nor any of its affiliates
assumes any responsibility to holders of Myovant common shares for the accuracy of this information. In particular,
the Financial
63
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Projections, while presented with numerical specificity necessarily, were based on numerous variables and
assumptions that are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic,
competitive and regulatory risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in the Financial Projections. Because the Financial Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they
become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each circumstance that
will have an effect on the commercial value of ORGOVYX®, MYFEMBREE®, RYEQO® and Myovant’s product
candidates. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Financial Projections accurately reflect future trends or
accurately estimate the future market for ORGOVYX®, MYFEMBREE®, RYEQO® and Myovant’s product candidates.
There can be no assurance of the approval, or timing of such approval, of any of Myovant’s clinical-stage product
candidates, and it is possible that other therapeutic scenarios will be preferable. Important factors that may affect
actual results and results in the Financial Projections not being achieved include, but are not limited to: the success
and cost of Myovant’s commercialization of its approved products and product candidates, if approved; the impact
on Myovant’s business, financial results, results of operations and ongoing clinical trials from the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic; risks related to development programs, including the success and anticipated timing of
Myovant’s ongoing and future clinical and non-clinical studies, and uncertainties relating to the success of
Myovant’s clinical trials for its product candidates and any future therapy or product candidates; uncertainties
surrounding the regulatory landscape that governs Myovant’s products and product candidates, including risks
related to regulatory approval, including the timing and status of anticipated future regulatory submissions and
Myovant’s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for its product candidates; the ability to obtain,
maintain, and enforce intellectual property protection for Myovant’s products and product candidates; risks related
to significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies; and other risks identified in
Myovant’s SEC filings, including Myovant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021 and Myovant’s most
recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and described under the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information.” The Financial Projections also reflect
assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.
Modeling and forecasting the future commercialization of products and clinical, pre-clinical and research stage
product candidates is a highly speculative endeavor. In addition to the various limitations, risks and uncertainties
described above, we also cannot assure you that Myovant will obtain and maintain any of the regulatory approvals
necessary for the commercialization of ORGOVYX®, MYFEMBREE®, RYEQO® and its product candidates, or that
Myovant’s competitors will not commercialize products that are safer, more effective or more successfully marketed
and sold than any products that Myovant may commercialize in the future.
The Financial Projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Myovant management believes are
helpful in understanding Myovant’s financial performance and future results. Myovant management regularly uses a
variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring
financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While Myovant believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide
meaningful information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze Myovant’s financial and
business trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP
financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported
by all of Myovant’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Myovant’s
competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise
require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP
financial measures provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed business
combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition,
reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Special Committee or its independent
financial advisor in connection with their respective evaluations of the Merger. Accordingly, Myovant has not
provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Projections to the relevant
GAAP financial measures.
The Financial Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they
were prepared, and, except as may be required in order to comply with applicable securities laws, Myovant does not
intend to update or otherwise revise the Financial Projections, or the specific portions presented, to reflect
circumstances existing after the date when they were made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the
event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error. For the foregoing reasons, as well as the bases and
assumptions on which the Financial Projections were compiled, the inclusion of specific portions of the Financial
Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that such projections are an accurate
prediction of future events, and they should not be relied on as such.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Myovant management prepared the Revised Projections, which were provided to the Special Committee, the
Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors) and Goldman Sachs. The Revised Projections are the final
projections that were made available to, and relied upon by, the Special Committee, the Myovant Board (other than
the Sumitomo Directors) and Goldman Sachs in connection with their evaluation of the proposed transaction with
Sumitovant and SMP. Myovant management had previously prepared the Initial Projections, which were also
provided to the Special Committee and Goldman Sachs. However, the Initial Projections were revised and superseded
by the Revised Projections and therefore were not relied upon by the Special Committee, the Myovant Board (other
than the Sumitomo Directors) or Goldman Sachs.
The Initial Projections were reviewed and adjusted by Myovant management based upon feedback provided by
the Special Committee, which adjustments included, without limitation, (i) modifying certain assumptions about the
probability of success for the contraceptive label impact on MYFEMBREE® revenue projections (from 100% to 72%),
(ii) updating the assumed worldwide loss of exclusivity for certain patent protections associated with ORGOVYX®
and MYFEMBREE® currently in the market to begin in 2036 rather than 2035 and (iii) updating the loss of exclusivity
for certain patent protections associated with new indications of Myovant’s existing products from 2033 to 2036.
These different assumptions are further described in the key assumptions underlying the Revised Projections and in
the key assumptions underlying the Initial Projections set forth below.
Revised Projections
The Special Committee, the Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors) and Goldman Sachs relied upon,
among other things, the following key assumptions underlying the Revised Projections:
•
3% annual price increase for ORGOVYX® and MYFEMBREE®;
•
volume growth (i) of approximately 11% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2028 (“fiscal year 2027”),
stepping down to approximately 3% by fiscal year 2036, for ORGOVYX®, (ii) ranging from approximately 8%
to approximately 45% in fiscal year 2027 and ranging from 0% to approximately 33% thereafter for
MYFEMBREE® and (iii) of 0% until the start of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2031 and growing
approximately 54% on average per year thereafter for a product candidate under development;
•
probability of success (i) of 100% for ORGOVYX®, (ii) ranging from 75% to 100% for MYFEMBREE®
(based on different indications, including 100% for use in the treatment of endometriosis in pre-menopausal
women) and (iii) 5% for a product candidate under development;
•
cash flows discounted to June 30, 2022, using the mid-year convention;
•
change in working capital assumed to be $0 in terminal year;
•
14% corporate effective tax rate and tax savings associated with NOLs discounted at WACC;
•
utilized $1.027 billion of NOLs (80% of taxable income for post-2017 NOLs) and $2 million in existing
Research & Development tax credit as of March 31, 2022;
•
2036 worldwide loss of exclusivity representing that Myovant has exclusivity on ORGOVYX® and
MYFEMBREE® through at least 2036 both within and outside the United States, after which generic
erosion is assumed (sensitivity of annual erosion of 60% to 100% within the financial analysis);
•
contraceptive label impact on MYFEMBREE® revenue projections at 72% probability of success; and
•
loss of exclusivity for certain new indications of Myovant’s existing products in 2036.

Initial Projections
Key assumptions underlying the Initial Projections include the following:
•
3% annual price increase for ORGOVYX® and MYFEMBREE®;
•
volume growth (i) ranging from approximately 9% to approximately 12% with a midpoint of approximately
11% in fiscal year 2027, and estimated to decrease subsequently with approximately 1% to approximately
4% in outer years, for ORGOVYX® and (ii) ranging from approximately 7% to approximately 14% in fiscal
year 2027 and ranging from approximately 1% to approximately 3% with a midpoint of approximately 2%
thereafter for MYFEMBREE®;
•
probability of success (i) ranging from 75% to 100% for MYFEMBREE® (based on different indications,
including 100% for use in the treatment of endometriosis in pre-menopausal women) and (ii) 5% for a
product candidate under development;
•

SMP Financial Information and Projections
SMP does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to future performance
due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and the
likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized. However, SMP provided certain non-
public financial projections to J.P. Morgan in its capacity as SMP’s financial advisor as part of the due diligence
process.
Sumitovant’s management teams developed long-range financial projections for ORGOVYX® and
MYFEMBREE®, relating to projected product revenue, milestone and royalty revenue, cost of goods sold,
collaboration expense to Pfizer, selling, general & administrative expenses, research & development expenses,
depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and net working capital values as adjusted by the probability of
success through fiscal year 2036, which we refer to as the “Sumitovant management projections,” such adjustments
assuming 100% probability of success for ORGOVYX® in prostate cancer and 100% probability of success for
MYFEMBREE® in uterine fibroids and endometriosis. The Sumitovant management projections also included a
probability of success adjustment of 60% in fiscal year ended March 31, 2030 and beyond to account for uncertainty
around the exclusivity period for ORGOVYX® and MYFEMBREE®. The Sumitovant management projections were
prepared based on budgets and information provided by Myovant in the ordinary course of business and not for
purposes of a potential merger. Sumitovant made its own assessments and adjustments to develop the Sumitovant
management projections. The Sumitovant management projections incorporated the latest assumptions relating to
ORGOVYX®’s and MYFEMBREE®’s development plans, cost and timing, loss of exclusivity, as well as a current
analysis of the competitive environment in the commercial forecasts of ORGOVYX® and MYFEMBREE®.
The Sumitovant management projections, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on
numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and many of which will be beyond Myovant’s
(and following the completion of the Merger, SMP’s) control. Because the Sumitovant management projections cover
multiple years, by its nature, this information becomes subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. The
assumptions upon which the Sumitovant management projections were based necessarily involve judgments with
respect to, among other things, development timelines, likelihood of clinical success, product pricing, market uptake,
reimbursement and potential competition, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of
which are beyond Myovant’s control. The Sumitovant management projections also reflect assumptions as to certain
business decisions and transactions that are subject to change and may not occur, at all or on the terms assumed.
Important factors that may affect actual results and result in the Sumitovant management projections not being
achieved include, but are not limited to: (i) the availability and level of third-party reimbursement for Myovant’s
products and services; (ii) market acceptance of such products and services; (iii) the introduction of new products
and services; (iv) access to sufficient capital; (v) the impact of competition; (vi) the effect of regulatory actions; (vii)
the effect of global economic conditions; (viii) changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (ix) other risk
factors described in Myovant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021, subsequent Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary
Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information.” In addition, the Sumitovant management projections may be
affected by Myovant’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable period.
The Sumitovant management projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and,
accordingly, do not necessarily comport with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial
information or generally accepted accounting principles. The summary of the Sumitovant management
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
projections is not being included in this proxy statement to influence a shareholder’s decision regarding whether to
vote in favor of the Merger Proposal but rather because the Sumitovant management projections represent an
assessment by SMP’s management of future performance and cash flows that was used in the financial analyses of
J.P. Morgan described above.
The Sumitovant management projections set forth below do not take into account any circumstances or events
occurring after the date they were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger and transaction-related
expenses. The Sumitovant management projections also do not take into account the effect of any failure of the
Merger to close and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The inclusion of the Sumitovant management projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an
indication that SMP or Myovant or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or representatives considered or
consider the Sumitovant management projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the Sumitovant
management projections should not be relied on as such. Neither the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant, nor any of
their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives can give any assurance that actual results
will not differ from these Sumitovant management projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to
update or otherwise revise or reconcile the Sumitovant management projections to reflect circumstances existing
after the date such Sumitovant management projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future
events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Sumitovant management projections are
shown to be in error or no longer appropriate. Neither the Purchaser Filing Persons nor Myovant intends to make
publicly available any update or other revision to the Sumitovant management projections except as required by law.
Neither the Purchaser Filing Persons nor Myovant nor any of their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or
representatives has made or makes any representation to any shareholder or other investor regarding the ultimate
performance of Myovant compared to the information contained in the Sumitovant management projections or that
projected results will be achieved.
The Minority Shareholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Sumitovant management
projections included in this proxy statement. 
The Sumitovant management projections incorporate certain financial measures, including earnings before
interest and taxes, or EBIT, net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT, and free cash flow to the firm, or FCF, which are
not measures under generally accepted accounting principles. Such financial measures should not be considered in
isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. SMP’s or J.P. Morgan’s calculations of these financial measures may differ from others in its
industry and are not necessarily comparable with information presented under similar captions used by other
companies.

Interests of Myovant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendations of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board acting upon the
unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee that you vote to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and
the Statutory Merger Agreement, you should be aware that, aside from their interests as shareholders of Myovant,
our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of other Myovant shareholders generally. The members of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board
(other than the Sumitomo Directors, who recused themselves) were aware of and considered these interests, among
other matters, in recommending the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement be adopted and
approved by Myovant shareholders.
69
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Myovant’s shareholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the
Merger Proposal. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the
narrative and the tables below.
Equity Awards
Equity awards granted by us to our directors and executive officers under the Equity Plans that are outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and such
directors and executive officers will receive cash payments in exchange for such equity awards in connection with the
Merger.
•
Myovant Options
Each option to purchase Myovant common shares granted under the Equity Plans that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, and that has an exercise price per
Myovant common share that is less than $27.00 will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash
payment for each Myovant common share that is subject to such option equal to the difference between $27.00 and
the per share exercise price of such option (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes). Each option
to purchase Myovant common shares granted under the Equity Plans that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, and that has an exercise price per Myovant
common share that is equal to or greater than $27.00 will be cancelled without payment.
•
Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units
Each Myovant RSU that has not been settled in Myovant common shares prior to the effective time will be
cancelled, except as provided in the paragraph below, and converted into the right to receive, in respect of each such
Myovant RSU, a cash payment equal to $27.00 multiplied by the number of Myovant common shares subject to such
Myovant RSU immediately prior to the effective time (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes).
Each Myovant PSU that has not been settled in Myovant common shares prior to the effective time will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive, in respect of each such Myovant PSU, a cash payment equal to $27.00
multiplied by the number of Myovant common shares subject to such Myovant PSU (deeming performance goals as
being satisfied) immediately prior to the effective time (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes).
On October 26, 2022, certain Myovant RSUs were granted to non-executive directors (other than Dr. Nishinaka)
in lieu of the regular and automatic annual grant of stock options pursuant to the Non-Executive Director
Compensation Plan that otherwise would have been granted to such non-executive directors. These Myovant RSUs
shall (x) vest in full on the earlier to occur of (i) October 26, 2023 and (ii) the date that is one day prior to Myovant’s
2023 annual shareholder meeting, subject in each case to such non-executive director providing continuous service
to Myovant through such date, or (y) to the extent the Myovant RSUs have not vested as of the effective time, vest
pro rata based on the number of days such non-executive director has served since October 26, 2022. The vested
Myovant RSUs shall be cancelled in exchange for the Myovant RSU consideration as set forth above, and the
unvested Myovant RSUs shall be cancelled without payment as of the effective time.
For additional information about beneficial ownership of Myovant common shares by our directors and
executive officers, please see the section entitled “Other Important Information Regarding Myovant Sciences Ltd.-
Security Ownership of Management and Certain Beneficial Owners.”
•
Quantification of Value of Equity Awards and Beneficial Ownership
The following table summarizes the estimated value to be received by each of our non-executive directors and
executive officers (consisting of our Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and three most highly
compensated executive officers, other than the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer) in respect
of his or her (i) Myovant common shares held as of January 17, 2023, (ii) vested options, and (iii) unvested options,
Myovant RSUs and Myovant PSUs outstanding as of January 17, 2023, assuming that these awards remain
outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time. For purposes of the following table, we have assumed that
(i) for purposes of options, Myovant PSUs and Myovant RSUs subject to vesting, the effective time occurred on
January 17, 2023, and (ii) all named executive officers and directors continue in service through the effective time. The
amounts presented in the table below were calculated using the per share merger consideration of $27.00.

Comprised of all vested options to purchase Myovant common shares that are exercisable as of January 17, 2023.
(2)
Comprised of all unvested options, Myovant RSUs and Myovant PSUs as of January 17, 2023, the value of which will be paid to
Myovant’s directors and executive officers in connection with the Merger.
(3)
For purposes of this column, the beneficial ownership of Myovant’s directors and executive officers is shown as the number of
Myovant common shares actually held, directly or indirectly, by each director or executive officer, excluding any shares subject
to unexercised vested options, unvested options, Myovant RSUs or Myovant PSUs, which are reflected in the other columns in
the table above. The beneficial ownership of Myovant common shares is shown differently in this section (as compared to the
section entitled “Other Important Information Regarding Myovant Sciences Ltd.-Security Ownership of Management and
Certain Beneficial Owners”) to avoid double counting of the equity awards in the table above. See the columns under the headings,
“Vested Options” and “Options, Myovant PSUs and Myovant RSUs Subject to Vesting” in the table above for additional
information.
(4)
For each non-executive director (other than Dr. Nishinaka), this column represents the number of Myovant RSUs that would vest
pro-rata upon the effective time of the Merger. At an October 23, 2022 Myovant Board meeting, the Myovant Board (other
than the Sumitomo Directors) unanimously determined that in lieu of the regular and automatic annual grant of stock options
pursuant to the Non-Executive Director Compensation Plan to non-executive directors, each non-executive director (other than
Dr. Nishinaka) would be granted an award of Myovant RSUs pursuant to the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, effective October 26,
2022, with a grant value equal to $266,200 in the aggregate. The number of Myovant RSUs subject to each grant was calculated
by dividing $266,200 by the per share merger consideration (provided that the number of Myovant RSUs subject to each grant
was rounded down to the nearest share). These Myovant RSUs shall (x) vest in full on the earlier to occur of (i) October 26, 2023
and (ii) the date that is one day prior to Myovant’s 2023 annual shareholder meeting, subject in each case to such non-executive
director providing continuous service to Myovant through such date, or (y) to the extent the Myovant RSUs have not vested as
of the effective time, vest pro rata based on the number of days such non-executive director has served since October 26, 2022.
The vested Myovant RSUs shall be cancelled in exchange for the Myovant RSU consideration as set forth in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement-Treatment of Myovant Equity Awards-Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units,” and the
unvested Myovant RSUs shall be cancelled without payment as of the effective time.
For additional information about beneficial ownership of Myovant common shares by our directors and
executive officers, see “Other Important Information Regarding Myovant Sciences Ltd.-Security Ownership of
Management and Certain Beneficial Owners.”
Employment Agreements with Executive Officers
Myovant has entered into employment agreements with David Marek, Uneek Mehra and Lauren Merendino and
amended and restated employment agreements with Matthew Lang and Dr. Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira (collectively,
the “Employment Agreements”), which provide for certain severance benefits and certain benefits upon a change in
control.
Severance Benefits. The Employment Agreements generally provide that if the executive is terminated from
employment by Myovant other than for cause or the executive terminates employment with good reason (as such
terms are defined in the Employment Agreements) within three months before, upon or within 18 months after (or in
the case of Mr. Marek, within 12 months after) a change in control (as such term is defined in the Employment
Agreements), then the executive officer will receive a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal to one times
(or in the case of Mr. Lang, 1.5 times) the sum of the executive’s base salary and the executive’s target annual bonus
71
TABLE OF CONTENTS
for the year of termination. In the event of such a qualifying termination, Myovant will also reimburse the total
amount of COBRA premiums (or in the case of Mr. Marek, Myovant’s portion of his COBRA premium) for the first 12
months of COBRA coverage for the executive and the executive’s eligible dependents (or in the case of Mr. Lang, the
first 18 months). If Myovant determines, in its sole discretion, that it cannot provide the COBRA premium benefits
without potentially incurring financial costs or penalties after a COBRA election has been made, eligible executives
will be entitled to receive monthly a fully taxable cash payment equal to the COBRA premium (or in the case of Mr.
Marek, 200% of Myovant’s portion of his COBRA premium) for the duration of the period that reimbursement would
otherwise be available. With respect to Mr. Marek only, in the event of such a qualifying termination, Myovant will
provide payment equal to Mr. Marek’s cost of living adjustment payments for a period covering 12 months following
the date of termination (provided that in no event will he be entitled to receive any cost of living adjustment
payments following the fifth anniversary of his employment start date). Pursuant to the Employment Agreements, the
provision of severance payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon the executive officer’s execution
and non-revocation of a release of claims.
Change in Control Benefits. The Employment Agreements further provide that if an executive is terminated from
employment by Myovant other than for cause or the executive terminates employment with good reason (as such
terms are defined in the Employment Agreements) within three months before, upon or within 18 months after (or in
the case of Mr. Marek, within 12 months after) a change in control (as such term is defined in the Employment
Agreements), 100% of the then unvested portion of each of such executive officer’s outstanding equity awards will
become fully vested (except with respect to Mr. Lang, as described below). Mr. Lang’s Employment Agreement
provides that upon a change in control during the term of Mr. Lang employment (or within three months following
termination of his employment other than for cause), Mr. Lang will become fully vested in 100% of the then unvested
portion of each of his outstanding equity awards. For the treatment of equity awards in the Merger, see the section
above entitled “-Equity Awards.” In addition, pursuant to Mr. Lang’s amended and restated employment agreement,
upon a change in control, Mr. Lang will become entitled to an additional payment equal to his prorated bonus (based
on the higher of target or actual achievement of pro rata performance targets for the number of days that have
elapsed in such fiscal year as of the change in control) for the number of days that have elapsed in such fiscal year as
of the change in control.
The parties have agreed to treat the consummation of the Merger as a “change in control” (or similar term) of
Myovant for purposes of determining severance entitlements under Myovant’s benefit plans and all employee
agreements, including these Employment Agreements.
Bonus Protections Under the Merger Agreement
The Merger Agreement provides that, to the extent not paid prior to consummation of the Merger, Myovant’s
executive officers will receive their annual bonus payments on the regular annual bonus payment date (subject to
such executive officer’s continued employment through such regular annual bonus payment date), based on
performance goals established by Myovant at the beginning of the fiscal year 2022 and accounting for partial
attainment of performance goals consistent with historical practice (but not discretionarily reduced for individual
performance factors unless determined by Myovant’s Principal Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee).
In the event that an employee’s employment is terminated, under circumstances entitling the employee to severance
after the effective time and prior to the regular payment date of the annual bonus for fiscal year 2022, such employee
(including the executive officers of Myovant) will become entitled to receive payments of a pro-rated target annual
bonus for fiscal year 2022 as soon as reasonably practicable following such date of termination.
Quantification of Non-Equity Related Entitlements of Executive Officers
The following table summarizes the estimated value to be received by each of our named executive officers for
purposes of this proxy statement pursuant to the executives’ respective entitlements under the Employment
Agreements and under the Merger Agreement, other than the equity interests which are quantified above. For
purposes of the following table, we have assumed that (i) the effective time occurred on January 17, 2023, (ii) the
employment of each named executive officer was terminated by Myovant without cause or by the named executive
officer for good reason, in each case immediately following the effective time for purposes of termination-related
severance or other payments, (iii) a pro rata annual bonus for fiscal year 2022 will be paid at target in respect of the
period employed; and the target annual bonus for this purpose is equal to the executive’s target short-term incentive
compensation for fiscal year 2022, and (iv) the additional payment for Mr. Lang will be based on his target short-term
incentive compensation for fiscal year 2022.

Directors and Executive Officers of Myovant Following the Effective Time
If the Merger is completed, except as otherwise determined by Sumitovant and notified in writing to Myovant at
least five business days prior to the effective time, (i) Myovant’s officers immediately prior to the effective time will
be the officers of the surviving company following the effective time; and (ii) the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the effective time will be the directors of the surviving company following the effective time.
Indemnification / Insurance
The Bye-Laws provide for indemnification of directors and executive officers against certain liabilities that may
arise by reason of their status or service as directors or executive officers. Myovant has also entered into agreements
with its directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in the Bye-
Laws. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, our directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification from Sumitovant and the surviving company and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies for at least six years following the Merger. The indemnification and insurance provisions in the
Merger Agreement are further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Other Covenants and
Agreements-Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance.”
Compensation of the Special Committee
The Special Committee consists of three independent members serving on the Audit Committee, Mark Guinan
(Chairman), Terrie Curran and Nancy Valente. Each member of the Special Committee will receive compensation of
$50,000 for such member’s service on the Special Committee and the Chairman of the Special Committee, Mark
Guinan, will receive an additional $15,000 for service as the Chairman of the Special Committee. These fees are not
dependent on the closing of the Merger or on the Special Committee’s or the Myovant Board’s approval of, or
recommendation with respect to, the Merger.
Merger Related Compensation
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for
each named executive officer of Myovant that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger. This compensation is
referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use
such term to describe the Merger related compensation payable to Myovant’s named executive officers. Our named
executive officers are not employees of Myovant, but rather are employees of Myovant Sciences, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Myovant, which provides services to us pursuant to an intercompany services agreement. For
purposes of this disclosure, Myovant’s named executive officers are (i) David Marek, Principal Executive Officer, (ii)
Uneek Mehra, Principal Financial Officer, (iii) Matthew Lang, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, (iv) Dr. Juan
Camilo Arjona Ferreira, Chief Medical Officer and (v) Lauren Merendino, Chief Commercial Officer. The “golden
parachute” compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of Myovant’s
shareholders.
The following table sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each named executive officer will or
may receive in connection with the Merger. For purposes of quantifying these potential payments and benefits for
the table below, the following assumptions were used:
•
the effective time of the Merger occurred on January 17, 2023, the latest practicable date prior to this filing;
•
the employment of each named executive officer was terminated by Myovant without cause or by the
named executive officer for good reason, in each case immediately following the effective time for purposes
of termination-related severance or other payments;
73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
a pro rata annual bonus for fiscal year 2022 will be paid at target in respect of the period employed; and the
target annual bonus for this purpose is equal to the executive’s target short-term incentive compensation
for fiscal year 2022; and
•
the value per share of Myovant common shares of $27.00, which is equal to the per share merger
consideration.
In addition, no assumption has been made regarding Myovant’s regular long-term incentive awards that may be
made to executive officers during fiscal year 2023 should the effective time occur after March 31, 2023, as such
awards are not presently determinable and are subject to the consent of Sumitovant. The named executive officers are
not entitled to any tax reimbursement in connection with the Merger, including, without limitation, relating to Section
4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).

(a)
The full bonus payment amounts for fiscal year 2022 at the target level of performance, assuming the executive officer was
not terminated following the change in control, are as follows: Mr. Marek, $560,000; Mr. Mehra, $280,000; Mr. Lang,
$280,000; Dr. Arjona Ferreira, $265,000; and Ms. Merendino, $260,000.
(b)
Mr. Lang will become entitled to an additional payment equal to a pro rata portion of his annual bonus payment upon
completion of the Merger (based on the higher of target or actual achievement of pro rata performance targets) for the
number of days that have elapsed in such fiscal year as of date of the change in control. For purposes of calculating the
amount for Mr. Lang in the tables above, we have assumed target performance.
The amounts set forth in the “Cash Severance” column above are “double-trigger” payments (i.e., they are conditioned upon the
named executive officer’s qualifying termination of employment in connection with the completion of the Merger). The
amounts set forth in the “Pro-Rated Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Bonus Under the Merger Agreement” column above are also
“double-trigger” payments (i.e., they are also conditioned on the named executive officer’s subsequent qualifying termination of
employment following completion of the Merger and prior to the regular payment date for fiscal year 2022 annual bonus). The
amount set forth in the “Additional Payment” column above (solely for Mr. Lang) represents a “single-trigger” payment, to be
made upon completion of the Merger (and is not conditioned upon Mr. Lang’s termination of employment). Details regarding
the terms of these payments, including payment timing and the applicable release requirements on which the cash severance
payments are conditioned, are set forth in the section above entitled “-Employment Agreements with Executive Officers.”

Amounts reported represent the aggregate value of the cash payments expected to be received in connection with vesting and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders
and non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below), whose Myovant common shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to
the Merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, judicial
opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), each as in
effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These provisions are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis,
and any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.
Myovant has not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the Merger, and,
as a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position
contrary to any of the tax consequences described below.
This discussion applies only to holders of Myovant common shares who hold such shares as a “capital asset”
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion
does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder in light of
such holder’s particular circumstances, or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under U.S.
federal income tax laws (including insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders
in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S.
dollar, tax-exempt organizations, cooperatives, banks and certain other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain
expatriates, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in partnerships or such other
entities, controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies, holders who own or have owned
(directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of the Myovant common shares (by vote or value), persons who
are required to recognize income or gain with respect to the Merger no later than such income or gain is required to
be reported on an applicable financial statement under Section 451(b) of the Code, and holders who hold Myovant
common shares as part of a straddle, constructive sale, or conversion transaction, holders who will own, through the
application of certain constructive ownership rules, an equity interest in the surviving company, holders who
acquired their Myovant common shares through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation
arrangements, Myovant or its wholly owned subsidiaries, Sumitovant, or Dissenting Holders). Moreover, this
discussion does not address the tax consequences of the Merger arising under any applicable state, local or foreign
tax laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to U.S. federal income tax.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Myovant common shares
that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
a trust (i) if the administration over such trust is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the
United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust; or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a
U.S. person; or
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
A “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Myovant common shares that is not a U.S. Holder or a
partnership.
If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) holds Myovant common shares, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally
depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding
Myovant common shares, you should consult your tax advisor.
You are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the Merger to you, as well as any consequences to you arising under any state, local and non-U.S. tax laws.
76
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Consequences to U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, subject to the “passive foreign investment
companies,” or “PFIC,” rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for Myovant common
shares pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between
(1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Myovant common shares.
Capital gain recognized by an individual U.S. Holder is generally eligible for the preferential long-term capital
gains rate if such individual U.S. Holder’s holding period in Myovant common shares exchanged in the Merger is
greater than one year as of the effective date of the Merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Myovant common shares at different times and different
prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each
block of Myovant common shares.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations. Generally, if, for any taxable year, at least 75% of
Myovant’s gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the value of its assets is attributable to assets that
produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, including cash, Myovant would be
characterized as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of these tests, passive income includes
dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than
rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or
business. Additionally, a look-through rule generally applies with respect to 25% or more owned subsidiaries.
Myovant’s status as a PFIC will depend on the nature and composition of its income and the nature,
composition and value of its assets from time to time. The asset test is generally based on the fair market value of
each asset, with the value of goodwill and going concern value determined in large part by reference to the market
value of Myovant common shares, which may be volatile. With respect to the taxable year that ended on March 31,
2022, Myovant believes that it was not a PFIC. However, Myovant cannot predict whether it will or will not be
classified as a PFIC in the current or future taxable year because the PFIC tests are based upon the average value of
its assets, including any goodwill and going concern value, and the nature and composition of its income and assets,
in each taxable year, which cannot be known at this time. Because the determination of whether Myovant is a PFIC
for any taxable year is a fact-intensive determination made annually after the end of each taxable year, and because
certain aspects of the PFIC rules are uncertain, Myovant therefore cannot provide any assurances regarding its PFIC
status for the current or future taxable year.
If Myovant is, or, at any time prior to the Merger, was, a PFIC, any gain recognized from the receipt of cash in
exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s
holding period for the Myovant common shares, the amount allocated to the taxable year in which the gain is realized
and to taxable years prior to the first year in which Myovant was classified as a PFIC would be taxable as ordinary
income and the amount allocated to each other year would be subject to tax as ordinary income at the highest tax rate
in effect for that tax year and the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax would be imposed in
respect of the tax attributable to each such year. At the same time, any loss that a U.S. Holder recognizes in the
Merger will generally be a capital loss. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. In addition, special
information reporting may be required.
The tax consequences that would apply if Myovant is or was classified as a PFIC may be different from those
described above if a U.S. Holder had made a valid “qualified electing fund,” or “QEF,” election. At this time, Myovant
does not expect to provide U.S. Holders with the information necessary for a U.S. Holder to make a QEF election in
the event that Myovant is a PFIC.
77
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
A non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain realized
from the Merger unless:
•
such gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if
required by an applicable treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by
the non-U.S. Holder in the United States); or
•
the non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year in which the Merger occurs and certain other conditions are satisfied.
A non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the
same manner as a U.S. Holder with respect to the receipt of cash in exchange for Myovant common shares in the
Merger. A non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of
30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty) on the portion of its effectively connected
earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments, attributable to the gain realized upon the
exchange of Myovant common shares in the Merger.
A non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a
30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty) on any gain recognized with respect to the
Myovant common shares surrendered in the Merger, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses.
United States Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
A U.S. Holder will generally be subject to information reporting, on IRS Form 1099, with respect to the receipt of
cash in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger that is paid within the United States or
through some U.S. related financial intermediaries to U.S. Holders, unless the U.S. Holder is a corporation or comes
within certain other categories of exempt recipients. A U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient will generally be
subject to backup withholding with respect to the cash received in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant
to the Merger unless the U.S. Holder timely provides a taxpayer identification number and complies with the other
applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A U.S. Holder who fails to provide a correct taxpayer
identification number may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.
Non-U.S. Holders will generally be subject to information reporting and possible backup withholding with
respect to the cash received in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the disposition of the Myovant
common shares effected within the United States, unless the non-U.S. Holder certifies to its foreign status or
otherwise establishes an exemption and the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder
is a U.S. Holder. Payments of cash in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger within the
United States by a payor within the United States to a non-U.S. Holder will be subject to backup withholding if such
non-U.S. Holder fails to provide appropriate certification, which includes a valid IRS Form W-8 or other
documentation upon which the payor or broker may rely to treat the payments as made to a non-US person. In the
case of such payments by a payor within the United States to a foreign partnership other than a foreign partnership
that qualifies as a “withholding foreign partnership” within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations, the partners of
such partnership will be required to provide the certification discussed above in order to establish an exemption from
backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be
allowed as a refund or credit against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information
is furnished to the IRS.
This discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information only and is not tax advice.
You are urged to consult your own tax advisor with respect to the application of the U.S. federal tax laws to your
particular situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules or under
the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction.

Litigation Relating to the Merger",89,89
Myovant Sciences Ltd._20230123_DEFM14A_20573637_4573939.Pdf,Litigation Relating to the Merger,"Litigation Relating to the Merger
On December 11, 2022, a purported shareholder of Myovant filed a lawsuit against Myovant and each member of
the Myovant Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Martin
Schiffenbauer v. Myovant Sciences Ltd., et al., Case No. 22-cv-10467. This complaint alleges that, among other
things, the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder by omitting
or misrepresenting certain allegedly material information in the proxy statement. This complaint seeks, among other
things, (i) injunctive relief preventing the shareholder vote or consummation of the proposed transaction, (ii)
rescissory damages or rescission of the Merger Agreement in the event the proposed transaction is consummated,
(iii) damages suffered as a result of the alleged omissions or misrepresentations of certain allegedly material
information and (iv) plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and expenses. The defendants intend to vigorously defend against
these claims and believe the claims asserted in this complaint are without merit.
On December 21, 2022, a purported shareholder of Myovant filed a lawsuit against Myovant and each member
of the Myovant Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Adrienne
Halberstam v. Myovant Sciences Ltd., et al., Case No. 22-cv-10788. This complaint alleges that, among other things,

things, (i) injunctive relief preventing the shareholder vote or consummation of the proposed transaction, (ii)

believe the claims asserted in this complaint are without merit.
Other potential plaintiffs may also file additional lawsuits challenging the Merger. The outcome of the
Schiffenbauer and Halberstam actions and any additional future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not
resolved,

could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Myovant, including any costs
associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the Closing is the absence of
any law or order from a governmental entity (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in
obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction
may prevent the Merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe. The defense
or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger is completed may adversely
affect Myovant’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

At the special general meeting, Myovant’s shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon:
•
the Merger Proposal;
•
the Compensation Proposal; and
•
the Adjournment Proposal.
The Merger Proposal requires the General Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval to be
obtained. The General Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval are both conditions to the
completion of the Merger.
The Compensation Proposal requires approval by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
Myovant common shares entitled to vote on such matter and voting at the special general meeting. However,
approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
The Adjournment Proposal requires approval by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
Myovant common shares present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on such matter at the special general
meeting. However, approval of the Adjournment Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.

The Special Committee and the Myovant Board acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special

•
“FOR” the Merger Proposal;
•
“FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and
•
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Please see the section entitled “Special Factors-Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special

recommendations of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board.
Record Date and Quorum
The holders of record of Myovant common shares as of the close of business on January 20, 2023, the record
date, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special general meeting. As of the record date, 97,235,316
Myovant common shares were issued and outstanding.
The presence at the special general meeting of holders of Myovant common shares representing, in person or
by proxy, a majority of the issued and outstanding Myovant common shares entitled to vote at the meeting as of the
record date will constitute a quorum, permitting Myovant to conduct its business at the special general meeting.
Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of Myovant common
shares representing the votes entitled to be cast at the special general meeting. If a broker who is a record holder of
shares indicates on a proxy card that the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote those shares, or if
those shares are voted in circumstances in which proxy authority is defective or has been withheld, those shares will
not be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.

Required Vote",91,92
Myovant Sciences Ltd._20230123_DEFM14A_20573637_4573939.Pdf,Required Vote,"Required Vote
Merger Proposal
The Merger cannot be completed unless the Merger Proposal is approved by (i) the General Shareholder
Approval and (ii) the Minority Shareholder Approval. As a result of the voting standard for the Minority
Shareholder Approval, if you fail to vote (including if you do not submit a validly executed proxy or attend the special
general meeting to vote your Myovant common shares, or if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee
how to vote your Myovant common shares) or if you abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal, the effect will be
the same as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. 
Compensation Proposal
The Compensation Proposal requires approval by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
Myovant common shares entitled to vote on such matter and voting at the special general meeting. For the
Compensation Proposal, only votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” will be counted as a vote cast. If you fail to
vote (including if you do not submit a validly executed proxy or attend the special general meeting to vote your
Myovant common shares, or if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your Myovant
common shares) or if you abstain from voting on the Compensation Proposal, your Myovant common shares will not
be counted in determining, and will have no effect on, the outcome of the Compensation Proposal.
Adjournment Proposal
The Adjournment Proposal requires approval by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
Myovant common shares present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on such matter at the special general
meeting. If you fail to vote (including if you do not submit a validly executed proxy or attend the special general
meeting to vote your Myovant common shares, or if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to
vote your Myovant common shares), your Myovant common shares will not be counted in determining, and will have
no effect on, the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. If you abstain from voting on the Adjournment Proposal, the
effect will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
Failure to Vote Shares Held in “Street Name”
In accordance with the rules of the NYSE, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold Myovant common
shares in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote those shares with respect to
the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, if banks, brokers or
other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owners of those shares, they are not
permitted to vote those shares with respect to any of the proposals to be voted upon at the special general meeting.
As a result, if you hold your Myovant common shares in “street name” and you do not provide voting instructions,
your Myovant common shares will (i) not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the
special general meeting, (ii) assuming a quorum is present, have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal with respect to the Minority Shareholder Approval and (iii) assuming a quorum is present, have no effect on
the Merger Proposal with respect to the General Shareholder Approval, the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal.
Abstentions
Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of Myovant
common shares represented at the special general meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
With respect to the Minority Shareholder Approval, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal. Additionally, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment
Proposal. However, abstentions are not considered votes cast for purposes of the General Shareholder Approval for
the Merger Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. As a result, abstentions will have no effect on whether the
General Shareholder Approval is obtained with respect to the Merger Proposal or whether the Compensation
Proposal is approved.

applicable withholding taxes (other than Myovant common shares held by (i) Dissenting Holders, who shall have the

On October 16, 2017, Myovant and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement for
secured debt financing (the “Hercules Loan Agreement”) with Hercules as agent and lender. The Hercules Loan
Agreement was ultimately terminated, and Myovant’s obligations thereunder were repaid in full, on December 30,
2019. Prior to such termination, and in connection with the funding of term loans pursuant to the Hercules Loan
Agreement, Myovant issued to Hercules (i) a warrant, dated October 16, 2017, to purchase up to 49,800 Myovant
common shares at an exercise price of $15.06 per Myovant common share, and (ii) a warrant, dated March 26, 2018, to
purchase up to 23,910 Myovant common shares at an exercise price of $18.82 per Myovant common share (the
warrant in clauses (i) and (ii), the “Myovant warrants”). As of January 17, 2023, an aggregate of 73,710 Myovant
common shares remained subject to purchase upon the exercise of the Myovant warrants.
To the extent any of the Myovant warrants are not exercised in full prior to the effective time, pursuant to the
terms set forth in the Myovant warrants, the Myovant warrants will be deemed to have been automatically exercised
in full with respect to any remaining Myovant common shares subject to purchase thereunder pursuant to the net
exercise provisions set forth in the Myovant warrants. As a result of such automatic net exercise, the holder of each
Myovant warrant will receive a number of Myovant common shares equal to the quotient of (i) the product of (A) the
number of Myovant common shares then subject to purchase pursuant to such Myovant warrant and (B) the
difference between the per share merger consideration and the then-effective exercise price of such Myovant warrant,
divided by (ii) the per share merger consideration. Following such automatic net exercise, at the effective time, each
Myovant common share received by the holder of a Myovant warrant will be treated the same as the other Myovant
common shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.",100,100

could be extended by mutual agreement). However, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, in determining

Voting Agreement, or the performance of obligations thereunder) and the negotiation, announcement,

exclusions);

expectations or projections, performance measures, operating statistics, budgets, guidance, estimates, or

any clinical events, occurrences, circumstances, changes, effects or developments relating to any product
candidates or with respect to any product of any competitor of Myovant (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to any pre-clinical or clinical studies, tests or results or announcements thereof, any
increased incidence or severity of any previously identified side effects, adverse effects, adverse events or

required by the express terms of the Merger Agreement.
Although the events and circumstances listed in the first four bullets and bullet six above are excluded from
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred, such matter may be taken into account to the
extent it has a disproportionate adverse effect on Myovant and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other
participants engaged in the oncology and women’s health product industry and in the geographical regions in which
Myovant and its subsidiaries operate (provided that such matter may be taken into account only to the extent of the
incremental disproportionate effect thereof).
In addition, a “Parent Material Adverse Effect” means any fact, circumstance, change, event or development
that, individually or taken together with other circumstances, occurrences, changes, events or developments, would
prevent or materially impair or materially delay Sumitovant’s ability to consummate the Merger or the other

Agreement by the End Date (which could be extended by mutual consent).

Until the earlier of the effective time or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms,
Myovant will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees
not to, and will direct its and its subsidiaries’ other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative acquisition
proposal (it being understood and agreed that ministerial acts that are not otherwise prohibited by the
Merger Agreement (such as answering unsolicited phone calls and informing persons of the provisions
summarized in this section or contacting any person making an alternative acquisition proposal solely to
ascertain facts or clarify terms and conditions) will not be deemed to “solicit,” “encourage” or “facilitate”
for purposes of, or otherwise constitute a violation of, non-solicitation provisions included in the Merger
Agreement);
•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions with or negotiations relating to (other than
Sumitovant, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) any alternative acquisition proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal (other
than informing persons of the provisions summarized in this section or contacting any person making an
alternative acquisition proposal solely to ascertain facts or clarify terms and conditions of such alternative
acquisition proposal for the sole purpose of the Special Committee reasonably informing itself about such
alternative acquisition proposal);
•
provide any non-public information to any person in connection with any alternative acquisition proposal
or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal;
•
otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an alternative acquisition proposal; or
•
except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, the Merger Agreement, cause or permit
Myovant to enter into an alternative acquisition proposal.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, “alternative acquisition proposal” means any proposal or offer, whether in
writing or not, from any third party (other than Sumitovant, Merger Sub and their affiliates) for any:
•
merger, amalgamation, scheme of arrangement, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
or tender offer, share purchase or other transaction involving or relating to Myovant that would result in
any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding equity interests of Myovant or
any successor or parent company thereto;
96TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
sale, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
scheme of arrangement, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint
venture, sale of share capital of or other equity interests in a Myovant subsidiary or otherwise) of any
business or assets of Myovant or its subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated assets
(whether by fair market value or book value) of Myovant and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
•
issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any person (or the shareholders of any person)
or group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 15% or more of the voting power of Myovant;
•
transaction in which any person (or the shareholders of any person) will acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group that
beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 15% or more of Myovant common
shares or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 15% or more of the voting power of Myovant; or
•
combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger and other than transactions solely
between or among Myovant and/or its subsidiaries).
From the date of the Merger Agreement and until receipt of the General Shareholder Approval at the special
general meeting, if Myovant receives an unsolicited, bona fide written alternative acquisition proposal that did not
arise from a breach in any material respect of Myovant’s obligations not to solicit acquisition proposals or engage in
discussions regarding acquisition proposals, Myovant may:
•
provide (or cause to be provided) information (including non-public information regarding Myovant or any
of its subsidiaries) and afford access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets,
books and records of Myovant and its subsidiaries to the person who made such alternative acquisition
proposal (and its representatives); provided that such information has previously been made available to,
or is made available to, Sumitovant promptly following the time such information is made available to such
person and that, prior to furnishing any such information, Myovant receives from the person making such
alternative acquisition proposal an executed confidentiality agreement that does not prohibit compliance by
Myovant with any of the provisions of the Merger Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision or otherwise prohibit the making or
amending of an alternative acquisition proposal to the extent such alternative acquisition proposal is made
directly to Myovant); and
•
enter into, engage in, participate in or continue any discussions or negotiations with any such person (and
its representatives) regarding such alternative acquisition proposal;
in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in the above bullets, the Myovant Board (acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that based on the information then available that
such alternative acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, “superior proposal” means a bona fide alternative acquisition proposal
(provided that for purposes of this definition, the applicable percentage in the definition of “alternative acquisition
proposal” shall be “50%” rather than “15%”) made by a third party or group that did not result from, or arise in
connection with, any breach in any material respect of Myovant’s obligations not to solicit acquisition proposals or
engage in discussions regarding acquisition proposals, that the Myovant Board (acting upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, and taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
alternative acquisition proposal and the conditionality of and contingencies related to such proposal, the expected
timing and risk of completion, the identity of the person making such proposal and such other factors that are
deemed relevant by the Special Committee:
•
is reasonably capable of being consummated on the proposed terms (without regard to whether Sumitovant
and any of its affiliates that are shareholders of Myovant would vote in favor of, tender into or otherwise
support such alternative acquisition proposal);
97
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
is more favorable to the holders of Myovant common shares from a financial point of view than the Merger
after taking into account all terms and conditions of such proposal and the Merger Agreement (including
any changes proposed by Sumitovant to the terms of the Merger Agreement); and
•
for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed by reputable
financing sources or reasonably determined by the Myovant Board (acting at the recommendation of the
Special Committee) or the Special Committee to be readily available.
Following Myovant’s receipt of any alternative acquisition proposal, Myovant will (i) promptly (and, in any
event, within 48 hours) following receipt (to Myovant’s knowledge) of any alternative acquisition proposal, give
notice to Sumitovant of the receipt of such alternative acquisition proposal, and the material terms and conditions of
such alternative acquisition proposal (including, in each case, the identity of the person or group making any such
alternative acquisition proposal); and (ii) as reasonably promptly as practicable provide to Sumitovant (A) a copy of
such alternative acquisition proposal, if in writing; or (B) a summary of the material terms of such alternative
acquisition proposal, if oral, and thereafter shall keep Sumitovant reasonably informed, on a current basis, of any
material developments regarding the alternative acquisition proposal or any material changes to the status and terms
of any such alternative acquisition proposal (including any amendments thereto).
Except as permitted below, the Myovant Board, including any committee thereof (including the Special
Committee), will not:
•
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify) the Myovant recommendation in a manner adverse to Sumitovant;
•
fail to include the Myovant recommendation in this proxy statement;
•
fail to recommend, within 10 business days after the commencement of such alternative acquisition
proposal through a tender or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act for
outstanding Myovant common shares (other than by Sumitovant, Merger Sub or an affiliate of
Sumitovant), against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders; or
•
approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement entered into in compliance with the Merger Agreement) relating to any alternative acquisition
proposal (any of the actions in the foregoing bullets, an “adverse recommendation change”).
From the date of the Merger Agreement and until receipt of the General Shareholder Approval at the special
general meeting of Myovant’s shareholders contemplated in this proxy statement, the Myovant Board (acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee may effect an adverse recommendation
change if:
•
(a) an unsolicited, bona fide written alternative acquisition proposal that did not arise from or in connection
with a breach in any material respect of Myovant’s obligations not to solicit acquisition proposals or
engage in discussions regarding acquisition proposals is received by Myovant and is not withdrawn, and
the Myovant Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such
alternative acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal or (b) an intervening event has occurred;
and
•
the Myovant Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure
to effect an adverse recommendation change in response to such superior proposal or intervening event,
as applicable, would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable law; provided, however, that an adverse recommendation change or action to terminate the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms may not be made unless and until Myovant has given
Sumitovant written notice of such action and the basis thereof six business days in advance, which notice
shall set forth in writing that the Special Committee intends to consider whether to take such action and (x)
in the case of a superior proposal, comply in form, substance and delivery with the notice provisions
described above and (y) in the case of an intervening event, include a reasonable description of such
intervening event.
98
TABLE OF CONTENTS
After giving the notice described above and prior to effecting such adverse recommendation change or taking
such action to terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, Myovant will, and will cause its
employees and direct its financial advisor and outside legal counsel to, negotiate in good faith with Sumitovant (to
the extent Sumitovant wishes to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement as would
permit the Myovant Board or the Special Committee not to effect an adverse recommendation change or to take such
action to terminate the Merger Agreement in response thereto. At the end of the six business day period, prior to
taking action to effect an adverse recommendation change or taking action to terminate the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Special Committee and the Myovant Board will take into account any changes to the
terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Sumitovant in writing and any other information offered by Sumitovant
in response to the notice, and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor that (i) in the case of a superior proposal, the superior proposal would continue to constitute a
superior proposal, and (ii) in the case of an intervening event, that the failure to effect an adverse recommendation
change in response to such intervening event would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable law, in each case, if such changes offered in writing were to be given effect. Any
modification to any alternative acquisition proposal will be deemed to be a new alternative acquisition proposal for
purposes of the Merger Agreement, except that the six business day advance written notice obligation set forth in
this section will be reduced to three business days.
In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, an “intervening event” means any material fact, event,
circumstance, development or material change in circumstances with respect to Myovant and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, that:
•
was unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Special Committee as of the date of the Merger
Agreement; and
•
does not relate to (a) any alternative acquisition proposal; (b) the announcement or pendency of the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger
Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, unless such facts, events, circumstances, developments
or changes in circumstances, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect; (c) any facts, events, circumstances or changes in circumstances that
result from a breach of the Merger Agreement by Myovant, (d) the fact that Myovant meets or exceeds any
internal or analysts’ expectation or projections (provided, however, that a fact, condition, change,
development or event underlying or that contributed to such failure may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been an intervening event) or (e) changes after the date of the Merger
Agreement in the market price or trading volume of Myovant common shares or the credit rating of
Myovant (it being understood that matters underlying the changes described in this clause (e) may, to the
extent not in contravention of the foregoing bullet, be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account, in
determining whether there has been an intervening event).
The Merger Agreement also provides that nothing will prohibit Myovant from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under United States federal or state law with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal or adverse
recommendation change; (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Myovant Board (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with
and receiving advice of its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, however, that if such disclosure has
the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Myovant recommendation, such disclosure shall be
deemed to be an adverse recommendation change and Sumitovant shall have the right to terminate the Merger
Agreement unless Myovant reaffirms the Myovant recommendation; or (iii) issuing a “stop, look and listen” or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, which shall not be deemed
to be an adverse recommendation change.

SEC Documents and Special General Meeting
Myovant agreed to, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms it has no further comments on
this proxy statement and the Schedule 13E-3, duly call, give notice of and hold a special general meeting of its
shareholders for the purpose of: (i) seeking the Required Shareholder Approval of the Merger

Proposal, (ii) seeking advisory approval of the Compensation Proposal, (iii) seeking the approval of the Adjournment
Proposal and (iv) seeking approval of any other proposal necessary for adopting and approving the Merger
Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger
Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, including the Merger.
Myovant further agreed that it will not change the date of, postpone or adjourn the special general meeting, or
submit any other proposal to Myovant’s shareholders in connection with the special general meeting, except (a) to
ensure that any supplement or amendment to this proxy statement or the Schedule 13E-3 required under applicable
law is timely provided to Myovant’s shareholders within a reasonable amount of time, in the good faith judgment of
the Myovant Board or the Special Committee (after consultation with outside counsel), in advance of the special
general meeting, (b) to the extent required by applicable law, or (c) if, on a date for which the special general meeting
of Myovant’s shareholders is scheduled, Myovant has not received sufficient proxies to obtain the General
Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval; provided that no single such adjournment or
postponement is for more than 10 business days except as may be required by federal securities laws; and in the case
of clause (c), the special general meeting is not postponed to later than the date that is 15 business days after the
date for which the special general meeting was originally scheduled without the prior written consent of Sumitovant
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as the special general meeting is
not postponed, recessed or adjourned to a date that is more than 45 days after the date on which the special general
meeting was originally scheduled) and that Myovant will, and will cause its proxy solicitor to, use reasonable best
efforts to solicit such additional proxies (or presence and affirmative vote in person of Myovant’s shareholders at the
special general meeting) as expeditiously as reasonably possible, it being understood that time shall be of the
essence. If, on any date for which the special general meeting is scheduled, Myovant has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Myovant common shares to obtain the Minority Shareholder Approval, Myovant
will, at Sumitovant’s request, postpone or adjourn the special general meeting on one or more occasions for up to 45
days in the aggregate to allow for the solicitation of additional proxies to obtain the Minority Shareholder Approval.
Myovant will also consider in good faith any other request by Sumitovant to postpone the special general meeting.
The obligation of Myovant to call, give notice of and hold the special general meeting will remain in effect
regardless of any acquisition proposal or any adverse recommendation change made by the Myovant Board.
Employee Benefits
During the one-year period immediately following the effective time (the “continuation period”), Sumitovant will,
or will cause the surviving company to, provide each continuing employee with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate
no less favorable than the base salary or hourly wage rate in effect immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) target
short-term incentive compensation opportunities no less favorable than the target short-term incentive compensation
opportunities in effect immediately prior to the effective time and (iii) other compensation (including long-term
compensation opportunities, whether cash or equity-based but excluding any retention or change in control benefits)
and benefits in the aggregate that, with respect to each such continuing employee, are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the aggregate of such other compensation and benefits in effect immediately prior to the effective
time.
During the continuation period, Sumitovant will provide, or cause the surviving company to provide, severance
payments and benefits to each continuing employee who incurs a termination of employment that are no less
favorable than the severance payments and benefits that Myovant would have been required to provide to such
continuing employee under the benefit plans in effect as of the effective time. The parties agreed to treat the
consummation of the Merger as a “change in control” (or similar term) of Myovant for purposes of determining
severance entitlements under Myovant’s benefit plans (including all of Myovant’s employee agreements).
In accordance with the Merger Agreement, Sumitovant will (i) or will cause each continuing employee to be
credited for his or her years of service with Myovant and any respective predecessors before the effective time; (ii)
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of new plans (as applicable) to be
waived for the continuing employees and their covered dependents; and (iii) take into account any eligible expenses
incurred prior to the effective time for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to each continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the new plans.
100
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Myovant has agreed that, if requested by Sumitovant, it will terminate the Myovant 401(k) Plan, effective as of
immediately prior to the effective time. In the event of a termination of the Myovant 401(k) Plan as of the effective
time, Sumitovant will designate and provide coverage under a Sumitovant 401(k) Plan for the continuing employees.
Additionally, to the extent not paid prior to consummation of the Merger, each employee of Myovant who was
employed as of immediately prior to the effective time will receive his or her annual bonus payment on the regular
annual bonus payment date (subject to such employee’s continued employment through such regular annual bonus
payment date), provided that (i) such bonus paid to employees at the level of vice president or below will in no event
be less than the target amount and (ii) such bonus paid to employees above the level of vice president will be based
on performance goals established by Myovant at the beginning of the fiscal year 2022 and will take into account
partial attainment of performance goals consistent with historical practice (but may not be discretionarily reduced for
individual performance factors unless determined by Myovant’s Principal Executive Officer and the Compensation
Committee). In the event that an employee’s employment is terminated under circumstances entitling the employee to
severance after the effective time and prior to the regular payment date of the annual bonus for the fiscal year 2022,
such employee (including the executive officers of Myovant) will become entitled to receive payments of a pro-rated
target annual bonus, as provided by the Merger Agreement, as soon as practicable following such date of
termination.
Efforts to Complete the Merger and Regulatory Matters
Each of Myovant and Sumitovant will use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions
and do (or cause to be done) all things that are necessary, proper or advisable under the Merger Agreement and
applicable law to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Merger, including (i) preparing and
filing with applicable governmental entities as promptly as reasonably practicable all necessary applications, notices,
disclosures, petitions, filings (or draft filings, as applicable), ruling requests and other documents required under any
antitrust laws (the “required approvals”), (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such consents as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and (iii) obtaining any waivers, qualifications, consents, certificates, clearances,
and approvals required from third parties (other than consents) in connection with the consummation of the Merger.
Sumitovant will control and lead all communications and strategy relating to obtaining any required approvals, and
Myovant will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and its directors and officers and direct its other representatives not
to, make any proposal to, or (except to the extent required by law) any filings with, governmental entities in respect of
any matter related to any required approvals without the prior written consent of Sumitovant or its counsel (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that Sumitovant shall keep Myovant
reasonably informed on a current basis, consult with and consider in good faith the views and comments of Myovant
in connection with such communications and strategy.
In addition, each of Myovant and Sumitovant agree to consult and cooperate with one another with respect to
obtaining such consents, approvals, filings and authorizations. However, neither Sumitovant nor any of its affiliates
is required to take any action or to permit or suffer to exist any material restriction, condition, limitation or
requirement, in each case, that (when taken together with all other such actions, restrictions, conditions, limitations
and requirements) would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the business, operations or
financial results of Sumitovant and any of its subsidiaries or the surviving company and its subsidiaries.
Access to Information
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the effective time, Myovant will allow Sumitovant, SMP and their
respective representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to
(i) to the extent not publicly available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by Myovant from the date of the Merger Agreement until the effective time pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities laws or SEC actions and (ii) all other information relating to the business, properties and
personnel of Myovant and its subsidiaries reasonably requested by Sumitovant; provided that Myovant is, after
consultation with outside counsel, entitled to redact or withhold information for reasonable privilege, confidentiality
or violations of law concerns; provided that Myovant will use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure which would not violate applicable law; provided, further,
that Myovant will not be required to disclose any materials of Myovant, the Myovant
101
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board or the Special Committee that relate to consideration of the Merger. All information that is provided to
Sumitovant is subject to the Nondisclosure and Common Interest Agreement.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance
The Merger Agreement provides that after the effective time, Sumitovant will keep all of the rights of directors,
officers and employees of Myovant and its subsidiaries with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and limitation of liability of individuals as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement in full force and effect.
Following the effective time, Sumitovant will, and will cause the surviving company to, indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each person who served as a director, officer or employee
of Myovant or its subsidiaries or who was prior to or is as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or who thereafter
commences prior to the effective time, serving at the request of Myovant or its subsidiaries as a director, officer or
employee of another person, against claims, liabilities, judgments, fines and fees, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any action or proceeding arising out of
such person’s role as a director, officer or employee of Myovant or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the
request of Myovant or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person.
For a period of six years after the effective time, the surviving company will either maintain or cause to be
maintained in effect the policies of directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary liability and employment practices liability
insurance currently maintained by Myovant or its subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for Myovant and its
subsidiaries of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
insured with respect to claims against any covered person; provided that the surviving company is not obligated to
expend on an annual basis an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by Myovant. In lieu of
the foregoing, Myovant may obtain a six-year “tail” policy under Myovant’s existing insurance policies providing
equivalent coverage if and to the extent such tail policy may be obtained in accordance with the expenditure cap
described in the previous sentence.
Certain Litigation

Services and Information Sharing Agreement
In February 2022, Myovant and two of its subsidiaries, Myovant Sciences GmbH and Myovant Sciences, Inc.,
entered into the Information Sharing Agreement with SBI. Under the Information Sharing Agreement, for so long as

Myovant’s business to Sumitovant, and with reasonable advanced notice, give Sumitovant and its representatives
the reasonable opportunity to discuss such information with Myovant’s senior management; and (2) subject to the
oversight of the chairperson of the Audit Committee, provide certain additional, more detailed information on
business-essential matters in order to collaborate with Sumitovant or to enable Myovant to leverage Sumitovant’s

Under the Information Sharing Agreement, Sumitovant also agrees to provide, upon Myovant’s election,
various administrative and general business support services as well as research and development services to

upon the relative percentage of time utilized on matters related to Myovant by the respective employee and a
mutually agreed upon mark-up on such expenses. Under the Information Sharing Agreement, all other third-party

Sunovion’s performance of certain regulatory services, at Sunovion’s costs; and (v) promptly notify Sunovion in the
event relugolix is recalled.
As consideration for the services, Myovant paid Sunovion an agreed-upon monthly service charge for each of
the first two years of the Market Access Services Agreement term and any agreed regulatory and training service
charges. After the second year of the Market Access Services Agreement term, the monthly service charges was

For the six months ended September 30, 2022, Myovant incurred $2.4 million under the Market Access Services
Agreement (inclusive of third-party pass-through costs billed to Myovant). For the three and six months ended
September 30, 2021, Myovant incurred $1.2 million and $2.4 million of expense under the Market Access Services
Agreement (inclusive of third-party pass-through costs billed to Myovant).
The Market Access Services Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties by the parties
and customary provisions related to confidentiality, indemnification and insurance. The initial term of the Market
Access Services Agreement is three years. Thereafter, the term will be automatically extended for one-year periods,
unless either party provides notice of its intent not to renew the Market Access Services Agreement at least nine
months prior to the expiration of the applicable term. Either party may also terminate the Market Access Services
Agreement prior to the end of its term in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, if there are
certain changes of law, or if such other party becomes insolvent or undergoes a change of control. Myovant may
also terminate the Market Access Services Agreement with respect to ORGOVYX® and/or MYFEMBREE® if
Sunovion fails to satisfy certain market access milestones or for convenience upon payment of a break-up fee.

SMP Loan Agreement
In connection with the Roivant Closing, SMP, Myovant and Myovant Sciences GmbH (the “Borrower”), entered
into the Loan Agreement on December 27, 2019, pursuant to which, among other things, SMP agreed to make
revolving loans to the Borrower in an aggregate principal amount up to $400 million, subject to certain conditions set
forth therein. On December 30, 2019, the Borrower used proceeds funded under the Loan Agreement, in the aggregate
amount of $113.7 million, to repay the outstanding obligations of Myovant and its subsidiaries under the Hercules
Loan Agreement and a securities purchase agreement with NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund IV, L.P. and the
other purchasers party thereto, and to pay for certain costs and expenses. The Loan Agreement was amended by the
First Amendment to the Loan Agreement (the “First Amendment to the Loan Agreement”) on December 24, 2022.
The Loan Agreement will terminate, and all obligations thereunder will become due and payable, on December
27, 2024. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, until the date occurring three months prior to December 27, 2024, the
Borrower will be entitled to borrow amounts no more than once in any calendar quarter to cover budgeted expenses
for such quarter, subject to certain conditions, including consent of the Myovant Board. If SMP fails to beneficially
own at least a majority of the outstanding Myovant common shares, it may become unlawful under Japanese law for
SMP to continue to fund loans to the Borrower, in which case Borrower would not be able to continue to borrow
amounts under the Loan Agreement. Interest on outstanding loans under the Loan Agreement accrue at a rate per
annum equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 3% and are payable quarterly on the last day of each calendar quarter. Loans
under the Loan Agreement are prepayable at any time without premium or penalty upon 10 business days’ prior
written notice.
120
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by
Myovant and certain of Myovant’s other subsidiaries (collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”). The loans and
other obligations are the senior unsecured obligations of Myovant, the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors.
The Loan Agreement includes representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants
customary for facilities of this type. The Loan Agreement also includes events of default customary for facilities of
this type, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, breaches of covenants following
any applicable cure period, cross acceleration to certain other debt, failure to pay certain final judgments, certain
events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency and failure of material provisions of the loan documents to remain in full
force and effect or any contest thereto by Myovant or any of its subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence of an event of
default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% will apply to the outstanding principal amount of the loans, and
SMP may (i) terminate its obligations to make loans to the Borrower, (ii) declare the principal amount of loans to be
immediately due and payable and (iii) take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. Upon the
occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, the obligations of SMP to make loans to the Borrower
would automatically terminate and the principal amount of the loans would automatically become due and payable. In
addition, if it becomes unlawful for SMP to maintain the loans under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower would be
required to repay the outstanding principal amount of the loans.
Under the First Amendment to the Loan Agreement, SMP agreed to, among other things, subordinate the
Borrower’s obligations to SMP under the Loan Agreement to all other existing and future claims against the Borrower.

RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL",126,132
Myovant Sciences Ltd._20230123_DEFM14A_20573637_4573939.Pdf,RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL,"RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL
Under Bermuda law, in the event of a merger of a Bermuda company with another Bermuda company or foreign
corporation, any shareholder of the Bermuda company is entitled to receive fair value for its shares. For purposes of
Section 106(2)(b)(i) of the Bermuda Companies Act, the Myovant Board considers the fair value for each Myovant
common share to be $27.00, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Any shareholder of Myovant who is not satisfied that it has been offered fair value for its shares and whose
shares are not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal may exercise its appraisal rights under the Bermuda Companies
Act to have the fair value of its shares appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda. Persons owning beneficial
interests in shares but who are not shareholders of record should note that only persons who are shareholders of
record are entitled to make an application for appraisal. Any shareholder of Myovant intending to exercise appraisal
rights must file its application for appraisal of the fair value of its shares with the Supreme Court of Bermuda within
one month after the date the notice convening the special general meeting to approve the Merger has been given.
The notice delivered with this proxy statement constitutes this notice. There are no statutory rules, and there are
limited decisions of the Supreme Court of Bermuda that prescribe in detail the operation of the provisions of Section
106 of the Bermuda Companies Act or the process of appraisal by the Supreme Court of Bermuda; the Supreme Court
of Bermuda retains considerable discretion as to the precise methodology that it would adopt when determining the
fair value of shares in an appraisal application under the Bermuda Companies Act.
If a shareholder of Myovant votes in favor of the Merger Proposal at the special general meeting, such
shareholder will have no right to apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda to appraise the fair value of its shares, and
instead, if the Merger is consummated, and as discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Effect of the Merger on the Myovant Common Shares and Merger Sub,” each Myovant common share of
such shareholder will be cancelled and will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration. Voting
against the Merger, or not voting, will not in itself satisfy the requirements for notice and exercise of a shareholder’s
right to apply for appraisal of the fair value of its shares.
A FAILURE OF A DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER TO AFFIRMATIVELY VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER
PROPOSAL WILL NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO HAVE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS COMMON
SHARES APPRAISED, PROVIDED THAT SUCH SHAREHOLDER DOES NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER
PROPOSAL.
In any case where a registered holder of Myovant common shares has made an appraisal application (having
already received the per share merger consideration), in respect of the shares held by such dissenting shareholder,
and the Merger has been made effective under Bermuda law before the Supreme Court of Bermuda’s appraisal of the
fair value of such Myovant common shares, then the dissenting shareholder shall be entitled to receive the fair value
of the Myovant common shares held by such holder if later appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda to be greater
than the value of the per share merger consideration received. Such dissenting shareholder will be paid the
difference, between the amount paid to him as the per share merger consideration and the value appraised by the
court within one month of the Supreme Court of Bermuda’s appraisal.
In any case where the value of the Myovant common shares held by a dissenting shareholder is appraised by
the Supreme Court of Bermuda before the Merger has been made effective under Bermuda law, then the surviving
company will be required to pay the dissenting shareholder within one month of the Supreme Court of Bermuda’s
appraisal an amount equal to the value of the Myovant common shares appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda,
unless the Merger is terminated under the terms of the Merger Agreement, in which case no payment will be made.
However, it is anticipated that, subject to having obtained the requisite approval, the Merger would have proceeded
prior to the appraisal by the Supreme Court of Bermuda.
A shareholder that has exercised appraisal rights has no right of appeal from an appraisal made by the Supreme
Court of Bermuda. The responsibility for apportioning the costs of any application to the Supreme Court of Bermuda
under Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies Act will be in the discretion of the Supreme Court of Bermuda.
122TABLE OF CONTENTS
The relevant portion of Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies Act in relation to appraisal rights is as follows:
“(6) Any shareholder who did not vote in favour of the amalgamation or merger and who is not satisfied that he
has been offered fair value for his shares may within one month of the giving of the notice referred to in
subsection (2) apply to the Court to appraise the fair value of his shares.
(6A) Subject to subsection (6B), within one month of the Court appraising the fair value of any shares under
subsection (6) the company shall be entitled either-(a) to pay to the dissenting shareholder an amount equal to
the value of his shares as appraised by the Court; or (b) to terminate the amalgamation or merger in accordance
with subsection (7).
(6B) Where the Court has appraised any shares under subsection (6) and the amalgamation or merger has
proceeded prior to the appraisal then, within one month of the Court appraising the value of the shares, if the
amount paid to the dissenting shareholder for his shares is less than that appraised by the Court, the
amalgamated or surviving company shall pay to such shareholder the difference between the amount paid to
him and the value appraised by the Court.
(6C) No appeal shall lie from an appraisal by the Court under this section.
(6D) The costs of any application to the Court under this section shall be in the discretion of the Court.
(7) An amalgamation agreement or merger agreement may provide that at any time before the issue of a
certificate of amalgamation or merger the agreement may be terminated by the directors of an amalgamating or
merging company, notwithstanding approval of the agreement by the shareholders of all or any of the
amalgamating or merging companies.”
SHAREHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER
NOMINEE FORMS, AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR
BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS AND OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE
PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR
APPRAISAL OF THOSE COMMON SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD
OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM AND OTHER
NOMINEE MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A
TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
A shareholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act
should, in addition to making an application to the Supreme Court of Bermuda, mail or deliver a written demand to:

with respect to sales of Myovant common shares in the public market will no longer be available. In addition,
registration of the Myovant common shares under the Exchange Act will be terminated. As a result, if the Merger is

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve,

“Special Factors-Interests of Myovant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Merger Related
Compensation” in Myovant Sciences Ltd.’s proxy statement for the special general meeting.”
The non-binding, advisory proposal to approve specified compensation that may become payable to the named
executive officers of Myovant in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
aggregate voting power of all issued and outstanding Myovant common shares entitled to vote on such matter and
voting at the special general meeting.
Holders of Myovant common shares should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the
Merger, and as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Myovant, the Special Committee, the Myovant
Board or Sumitovant. Further, the underlying awards and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their
terms, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote, if
the Merger is consummated, Myovant’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is
based on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those
payments.

Myovant shareholders are also being asked to consider and vote on the Adjournment Proposal. We are seeking
shareholder approval to adjourn the special general meeting even if a quorum is present, if necessary and
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special general meeting to
approve the Merger Proposal. If the special general meeting is adjourned, notice of the resumption of the meeting
shall be given to each shareholder of Myovant entitled attend and vote at the meeting, unless the meeting is
adjourned to a specific date, time and place announced at the meeting being adjourned. If the Myovant shareholders
approve the Adjournment Proposal, Myovant could adjourn the special general meeting and any adjourned session
of the special general meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of
proxies from shareholders that have previously provided proxies to vote against the approval of the Merger Proposal
(other than in respect of any proposal for which the vote has been taken and the polls have been closed at the
special general meeting)
The approval by shareholders of the Adjournment Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
Required Vote
The Adjournment Proposal requires approval by the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of all
issued and outstanding Myovant common shares present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on such matter
at the special general meeting. If you fail to vote, your Myovant common shares will not be counted in determining,
and will have no effect on, the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. If you abstain from voting on the Adjournment
Proposal, the effect will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.

To reduce the expense of delivering duplicate proxy materials to shareholders who may have more than one
account holding Myovant common shares who share the same address, we have adopted a procedure approved by
the SEC called “householding.” Under this procedure, a single set of this proxy statement will be sent to any
household at which two or more of Myovant’s shareholders reside. Householding benefits both you and us. It
reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps to reduce Myovant’s expenses.
The procedure applies to Myovant’s annual reports, proxy statements, other proxy materials and information
statements. Once you receive notice from your broker or from us that communications to your address will be
“householded,” the practice will continue until you are otherwise notified or until you revoke your consent to the
practice. Each shareholder will continue to have access to and utilize separate proxy voting instructions.
If you do not wish to participate in “householding” and would like to receive a separate copy of this proxy
statement, please notify your broker or Myovant. Direct your written request to Myovant Sciences, Ltd., Attn:
Corporate Secretary, at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda, or call us at (650) 392-0222.
Shareholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy materials at their addresses and would like to request
“householding” of their communications should contact their brokers.

If the Merger is completed, you will have no entitlement to attend and vote at any future annual general meeting
of shareholders, including for 2023. If the Merger is not completed, you will continue to be entitled to attend and
participate in our annual general meetings of shareholders, including the 2023 Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders (the “2023 Annual Meeting”), in which case we will provide notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the
date on which such 2023 Annual Meeting will be held.
If you would like to submit a proposal for inclusion in the proxy materials for the 2023 Annual Meeting, your
proposal must comply with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. In accordance with Rule 14a-8, any such proposal
must be received on or prior to March 30, 2023 by Myovant at its executive offices at Myovant Sciences Ltd., Attn:

If you wish to nominate an individual for election at, or bring business before, the 2023 Annual Meeting, and do
not intend such nomination or business to be included in the proxy materials for such meeting, you must deliver your
written notice to our Secretary at our registered office disclosed above no earlier than June 23, 2023 and no later than
July 23, 2023, in accordance with the Bye-Laws; provided that if the date of the 2023 Annual Meeting is earlier than
September 21, 2023, or later than November 20, 2023, you must submit your proposal to the address mentioned above
not later than 10 days following the earlier of (i) the date on which notice of the 2023 Annual Meeting was posted to
our shareholders or (ii) the date on which public disclosure of the date of the 2023 Annual Meeting was made. Your
notice to Myovant must also set forth the information specified in and comply with Section 24.1 of the Bye-Laws.
Additionally, under Section 24 of the Bye-Laws, only shareholders holding not less than 5% of the total voting
rights, who have held such voting rights for at least three years, may require us to give notice to Myovant’s
shareholders of a proposal to be submitted at an annual general meeting. Generally, notice of such a proposal must be
received by us at Myovant’s registered office in Bermuda (located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton,
HM 11, Bermuda) not less than six weeks before the date of the meeting and must otherwise comply with the
requirements of Bermuda law.
In addition to satisfying the requirements under the Bye-Laws with respect to advance notice of any
nomination, any shareholder that intends to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than Myovant’s
director nominees in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act must provide notice to Myovant at
Myovant’s registered office in Bermuda (located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton, HM 11, Bermuda) no
later than August 22, 2023 (or, if we hold the 2023 Annual Meeting earlier than September 21, 2023, or later than

13. Interpretation.
a. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section or Schedule, such reference will be to a Section or
a Schedule of or to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth herein. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they will be
deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “will” and “will not” are expressions of
command and not merely expressions of future intent or expectation. The words “hereof,” “hereto,” “hereby,”
“herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term “or” is not exclusive. The word “extent” in the
phrase “to the extent” will mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase will not mean
simply “if.” The following general rules apply: the singular number will include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender will include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender will include the masculine and
neuter genders; and the neuter gender will include the masculine and feminine genders. Any Law defined or referred
to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein will include any modification, amendment or re-
enactment thereof, and any Law substituted therefor, in each case, as of the time of inquiry, representation, or
covenant and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued or related to such Law. Any reference to a
Governmental Entity will be also deemed to refer to any successor thereto unless the context requires otherwise. A
reference to any agreement (including this Agreement), or Contract is, unless otherwise specified, to the agreement,
or Contract as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced at the time of inquiry, representation or covenant.
References herein to a Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, when calculating the period of time within which, or following which, any act is to be done or step
taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference day in calculating such period shall be excluded and
if the last day of the period is not a Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next Business Day or if any
action must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such action may be validly taken on
or by the next day that is a Business Day. References to a number of days, shall refer to calendar days unless
Business Days are specified.
b. Each party to this Agreement represents and agrees with each other that it has been represented by or had
the opportunity to be represented by, independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had the full right and
opportunity to consult with its respective attorney(s), that to the extent, if any, that it desired, it availed itself of this
right and opportunity, that it or its authorized officers (as the case may be) have carefully read and fully understand
this Agreement in its entirety and have had it fully explained to them by such party’s respective counsel, and that it
or its authorized officer (as the case may be) is competent to execute this Agreement and has executed this
Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue influence. The parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
with the opportunity to seek advice as to their legal rights from such counsel. In the event an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement is to be construed as jointly drafted by the parties to this Agreement
and no presumption or burden of proof is to arise favoring or disfavoring any party to this Agreement by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or by reason of the extent to which any such provision is
inconsistent with any prior draft hereof.

schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto and the Company Disclosure Letter) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior written agreements, arrangements, communications and understandings and all prior and
contemporaneous oral agreements, arrangements, communications and understandings between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or
equitable right, benefit, claim or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this Agreement.
17. Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons that are expressly named
as parties to this Agreement. Except to the extent named as a party to this Agreement, and then only to the extent of
the specific obligations of such parties set forth in this Agreement, no past, present or future shareholder, member,
partner, manager, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or representative of any party to this Agreement will have
any Liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or Liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement.
18. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS
SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF (OR ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION) TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER
JURISDICTION, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAWS OF BERMUDA ARE
MANDATORILY APPLICABLE TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
19. Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Venue. Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees
that the rights of each party to this Agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
special, unique and of extraordinary character and that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or
damage would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party to
this Agreement agrees that, in addition to any other available remedies a party to this Agreement may have in equity
or at law, each party to this Agreement shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and to obtain an injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the
provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts (as defined below) without necessity of posting a bond or other
form of security. In the event that any Action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no party to this Agreement shall allege, and each party to this Agreement hereby waives the defense,
that there is an adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by (x) Shareholder or its Affiliates against the Company or its
Affiliates or (y) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary against Shareholder or any of its Affiliates, in any such
case, will be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; provided that if jurisdiction is

mandatorily must be brought in Bermuda (the “Chosen Courts”). Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees not to commence any Action relating thereto
except in the Chosen Courts, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment,
decree, or award rendered by any such Chosen Court as described herein. Each of the parties to this Agreement
further agrees that notice as provided herein will constitute sufficient service of process and the parties to this
Agreement further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts as described herein
for any reason; (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts or from any legal
process commenced in the Chosen Courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise); and (c) that (i) the Action in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum; (ii) the venue of such Action is improper; or (iii) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by the Chosen Courts.
20. Assignment; Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement (and any of their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns). No party to this
Agreement may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part,
by operation of Law or otherwise, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 20 shall be null and
void.
21. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the illegality, invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any Person or any
circumstance, is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in
order to carry out, so far as may be legal, valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such legal, invalid or
unenforceable provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability affect the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision, or the
application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than
Sumitovant Biopharma Ltd. (“Parent”) and its affiliates) of the outstanding common shares, par value $0.000017727
per share (the “Shares”), of Myovant Sciences Ltd. (the “Company”) of the $27.00 in cash per Share to be paid to
such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 23, 2022 (the “Agreement”), by and
among Parent, Zeus Sciences Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, the Company and, solely with respect to
Article IX and Annex A therein, Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. (“SMP”).
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,
sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for
various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities
they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time
purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,
currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective
affiliates and third parties, including Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., the parent company of SMP (“Sumitomo”), and its
affiliates or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the Agreement (the
“Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company (the “Special Committee”) in connection with, and have participated in certain of the negotiations leading
to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, all of which are
contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our
expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We have
provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time
for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as
the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the licensing of ORGOVYX® commercialization rights in certain
territories in May 2022. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the
Company, Parent, Sumitomo and their respective affiliates for which our Investment Banking Division may receive
compensation.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; Annual Reports on Form 10-
K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended March 31, 2022; Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company;
certain other communications from the Company to its shareholders; certain publicly available research analyst
reports for the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company, including assumed
probabilities associated with certain future events contemplated by such forecasts, and certain analyses related to
the expected utilization by the Company of certain net operating loss carryforwards and research and development
credit carryforwards of the Company, each as prepared by the management of the Company and approved for our use
by the Special Committee (together, the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior
management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial
condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares;
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other
companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent minority squeeze
out transactions, including in the biopharmaceutical industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and
considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed
with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we
have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the Special Committee. We have not made an independent evaluation
or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and
liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or
appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the
Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on
the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which
would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor
does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the
$27.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and
our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any
other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the
Transaction, including the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by,
the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness
of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of
the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $27.00 in cash per
Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement or
otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time, as to the
potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the Transaction, or
as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the
Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on
economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the
date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on
circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion
expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Special Committee in connection with its
consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of
Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a
fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $27.00 in cash per Share to
be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial
point of view to such holders of Shares.
Very truly yours,

appraised by the Court.
(6C) No appeal shall lie from an appraisal by the Court under this section.
(6D) The costs of any application to the Court under this section shall be in the discretion of the Court.

Consideration payable in respect of the Company Common Shares represented thereby.
A-4TABLE OF CONTENTS
(c) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon (i) in the case of Company
Common Shares represented by a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificate, as provided in Section
2.02(i)), the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with the Letter of
Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii) in the case
of Company Common Shares held as Book-Entry Shares, the receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying
Agent, in each case together with such other documents as reasonably may be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
consideration payable in respect of the Company Common Shares previously represented thereby pursuant to
Section 2.01. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares that has not been
registered in the register of members of the Company, any Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the Company Common Shares previously represented thereby may be paid to the transferee or transferees if the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing such prior Company Common Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, proper evidence of such transfer) accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable share transfer Taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share,
including any prior Company Common Shares represented thereby, will, at any time from and after the Effective
Time, represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the consideration that the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled to receive from the Paying Agent or the Surviving Company in respect
of the prior Company Common Shares represented thereby pursuant to this Section 2.02(c). No interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares. The Per Share Merger Consideration
when actually paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II in respect of each cancelled Company Common
Share and each Company Share Award will be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Common Share or Company Share Award, as applicable. From and after the
Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving
Company of Company Common Shares or Company Share Awards that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Company Common
Shares or Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights
with respect to such Company Common Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement (including
Section 2.01(d)) or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Company
Common Shares or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Company, or the Paying Agent for
any reason, they will be cancelled as provided in this Article II, with the holder thereof entitled to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Common Shares represented thereby pursuant
to Section 2.01 and, in the case of Dissenting Shares, subject to applicable Law.
(e) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest or any other
amounts received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares
on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time may, upon Parent’s request, be delivered to the
Surviving Company (or its designee), and after any such delivery, any holder of a Company Common Share who
has not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to the Surviving Company (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of its claim for the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto, without any interest thereon.
(f) No Liability. None of the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or the Paying Agent will be liable to
any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Article II that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the date on which
such portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(g) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent will invest any cash in the Payment Fund if and as
directed by Merger Sub or the Surviving Company. Any interest and other income resulting from such
A-5
TABLE OF CONTENTS
investments will be paid to, and be the property of, the Surviving Company. No investment losses resulting from
any investment of the Payment Fund will diminish the rights of any of the Company’s shareholders to receive
their portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable to them. To the extent there are losses with respect
to such investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make
prompt cash payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration required to be paid to each holder of Company
Common Shares entitled to receipt thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Surviving Company will
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.
(h) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and the
Paying Agent (without duplication) will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under applicable Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.
(i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate formerly representing any Company Common
Share has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Company with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to Section
2.02(e), the Surviving Company) will deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per
Share Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each Company Common Share represented thereby,
pursuant to this Agreement.

(a) No Solicitation. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.03, the Company will not, and will
cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees not to,
and shall direct its and the Company Subsidiaries’ other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time, but not
after, the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written
Alternative Proposal that did not arise from or in connection with a breach in any material respect of the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.03, the Company may:
(i) provide (or cause to be provided) information (including non-public information regarding the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) and afford access to the business, employees, officers,
contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person who made such Alternative Proposal (and its Representatives); provided that such information has
previously been Made Available to, or is Made Available to, Parent promptly following the time such
information is made available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any such information, the
Company receives from the Person making such Alternative Proposal an executed confidentiality
agreement that does not prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the provisions of this Agreement
(it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision or
otherwise prohibit the making or amending of an Alternative Proposal to the extent such Alternative
Proposal is made directly to the Company); and
(ii) enter into, engage, participate in or continue any discussions or negotiations with any such
Person (and its Representatives) regarding such Alternative Proposal;
in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board
(acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that based on the information then available and after consultation with its
financial advisor that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal.
(c) Notice of Alternative Proposals. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight
(48) hours) following receipt (to the Knowledge of the Company) of any Alternative Proposal, give notice to
Parent of the receipt of such Alternative Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal (including, in each case, the identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative Proposal),
and the Company will as reasonably promptly as practicable provide to Parent (i) a copy of such Alternative
Proposal, if in writing; or (ii) a summary of the material terms of such Alternative Proposal, if oral, and thereafter
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, of any material developments regarding the
Alternative Proposal or any material changes to the status and terms of any such Alternative Proposal
(including any amendments thereto).
(d) No Change in Recommendation.

committee thereof (including the Special Committee), agrees that it shall not:
(A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent;
(B) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;
A-37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(C) fail to recommend, within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such
Alternative Proposal through a tender or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act for outstanding Company Common Shares (other than by Parent, Merger Sub or an Affiliate of
Parent), against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders; or
(D) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose to enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.03(a) entered into in compliance with
Section 5.03(a)) relating to any Alternative Proposal (any of the actions in the foregoing clauses (A),
(B), (C) and (D), an “Adverse Recommendation Change”).
(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time the Company
Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) or the Special Committee may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if (A)(1) an
unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Proposal that did not arise from or in connection with a breach in
any material respect of the obligations set forth in Section 5.03(a) is received by the Company and is not
withdrawn, and the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the
Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) an Intervening Event has
occurred, and (B) the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the
Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Superior Proposal
or Intervening Event, as applicable, would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that an Adverse Recommendation Change or
action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 may not be made unless and until the
Company has given Parent written notice of such action and the basis thereof six (6) Business Days in
advance, which notice shall set forth in writing that the Special Committee intends to consider whether to
take such action and (x) in the case of a Superior Proposal, comply in form, substance and delivery with the
provisions of Section 5.03(c) and (y) in the case of an Intervening Event, include a reasonable description
of such Intervening Event. After giving such notice and prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation
Change or taking such action to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company shall, and
shall cause its employees and direct its financial advisor and outside legal counsel to, negotiate in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would permit the Company Board or the Special Committee not to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to take such action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 in
response thereto. At the end of the six (6) Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or taking action to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, the
Company Board and the Special Committee shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in writing and any other information offered by Parent in response to the
notice, and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor that (I) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (II) in the case of an Intervening Event, that the failure to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, in each case, if such changes offered
in writing were to be given effect. Any modification to any Alternative Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Alternative Proposal for purposes of Section 5.03(c) and this Section 5.03(d)(ii) except that the advance
written notice obligation set forth in this Section 5.03(d)(ii) shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days.
(e) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit the Company from
(i) complying with its disclosure obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard to an
Alternative Proposal or Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the
Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee
determines in good faith (after consultation with and receiving advice of its outside legal counsel) that the
A-38

failure to do so would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, however, that if such disclosure has the substantive effect of withdrawing or
adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change and Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section
8.01(f) unless the Company reaffirms the Company Recommendation; (iii) or issuing a “stop, look and listen” or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, which shall not be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.",187,190

(a) As reasonably promptly as practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) Business Days; provided
Parent timely provides all required information with respect to Parent, SMP or Merger Sub and otherwise
complies with its obligations hereunder in all material respects) following the Agreement Date, the Company will,
in a manner that complies with Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to the
Transactions, prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement to be sent to the Company’s
shareholders relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting that reflects the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and includes the notice of appraisal rights in the Merger to the holders of Company Common Shares
as required by Section 106(2) of the Bermuda Companies Act, and a copy of the Fairness Opinion in its entirety
(including a description of the Fairness Opinion and the financial analysis relating thereto) (such proxy
statement, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Proxy Statement”) in preliminary form.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company all information reasonably requested by the
Company concerning Parent, SMP or Merger Sub, and provide such other assistance, as the Company may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate and consult with each other in good faith in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement. The Company will notify Parent reasonably promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) after its receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and will provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the
Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) respond as reasonably promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement, and Parent will cooperate in connection therewith and (ii) have the SEC advise
as promptly as reasonably practicable that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. In addition
to the foregoing, the Company shall file the Proxy Statement in definitive form with the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the SEC advises the Company that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Proxy Statement in preliminary or definitive form, or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to, or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to, the Proxy Statement, or mailing the Proxy Statement in definitive form to the Company’s
shareholders, the Company will: (x) provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement or response (including the proposed final version of the Proxy Statement or response); and (y)
reasonably cooperate in good faith with Parent to include Parent’s reasonable comments that are promptly
proposed by Parent to the Proxy Statement related to Parent or the Transactions.
(b) The Company and Parent will cooperate to (i) concurrently with the preparation and filing of the Proxy
Statement, jointly prepare and file with the SEC a Rule 13E-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 (together
with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the “Schedule 13E-3”) relating to the Transactions, and
furnish to each other all information concerning such Party as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the preparation of the Schedule 13E-3; (ii) respond as reasonably promptly as practicable to any comments
received from the SEC with respect to the Schedule 13E-3 and consult with each other prior to providing such
response; (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare and file any amendments or supplements
necessary to be filed in response to any such comments; (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to have cleared by
the staff of the SEC the Schedule 13E-3; and (v) to the extent required by applicable Law, as promptly as
reasonably practicable prepare and file any supplement or amendment to the Schedule 13E-3. Each Party will
promptly notify the other Parties upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the

Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand.

inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 that is required by Law to be described in an amendment
of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, Parent will reasonably promptly notify the
Company of such change, and Parent and the Company will cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, as applicable, so that either
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, and, as required by Law, in disseminating the information contained
in such amendment or supplement to the Company’s shareholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(c) will limit the
obligations of any Party under Section 6.01(a).
(d) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, that is required by Law to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, the Company will reasonably promptly notify Parent
of such event, and the Company and Parent will cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, as applicable, so that either such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, and, as required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in
such amendment or supplement to the Company’s shareholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(d) will limit the
obligations of any Party under Section 6.01(a).
(e) The Company will, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3: (i) establish a record date for determining
shareholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Shareholders Meeting; (ii) not change such
record date or establish a different record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior written
consent of Parent unless required to do so by applicable Law (and if the date of the Company Shareholders
Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless
Parent has otherwise approved in writing (or as required by applicable Law or stock exchange requirement), the
Company will, if possible, implement such adjournment or other delay in such a way that the Company does not
need to establish a new record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting, as so adjourned or delayed); and
(iii) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of: (A)
seeking the Company Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval; (B) in accordance with
Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, seeking advisory approval of a
proposal to the Company’s shareholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that
may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the completion of the
Merger; (C) an adjournment proposal; and (D) seeking approval of any other proposal necessary for adopting
and approving this Agreement and consummating the Transactions. The Company will not change the date of,
postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting, or submit any other proposal to the Company’s
shareholders in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting, without the prior written consent of
Parent. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Company’s shareholders as of the record date established for the Company Shareholders Meeting; and
(ii) except if an Adverse Recommendation Change has been made as permitted by Section 5.03(d) and remains in
effect, solicit the Company Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval, including by
retaining the services of a recognized proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Company Board,
acting at the recommendation of the Special Committee, and the Special Committee, will recommend to the
Company’s shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder
Approval (the “Company Recommendation”) and will include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
the Schedule 13E-3, in each case, unless the Company Board (acting at the recommendation of the Special
Committee) or the Special Committee has validly made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
Section 5.03(d) that is still in effect. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms prior thereto, its obligations to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting pursuant
A-40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to this Section 6.01 will not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Alternative Proposal, by the making of any Adverse Recommendation
Change by the Company Board (acting at the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee or by any other development; provided, however, that if the public announcement of an Adverse
Recommendation Change or the delivery of notice by the Company to Parent pursuant to Section 5.03(d)(i)
occurs less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company will be
entitled to postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to a date not more than ten (10) Business Days after
the date such Company Shareholders Meeting had previously been scheduled (but in no event to a date after
the date that is five (5) Business Days before the End Date).
(f) The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01 notwithstanding, the Company will have the right, after
consultation in good faith with Parent, to make one or more successive changes in date, postponements or
adjournments of the Company Shareholders Meeting (i) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 required under applicable Law is timely provided to the shareholders of the
Company within a reasonable amount of time, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board or the Special
Committee (after consultation with outside counsel), in advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting; (ii) if
required by applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its staff; or (iii) if, on a date for which the Company
Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
Company Common Shares to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present; provided that no single such adjournment or postponement is for
more than ten (10) Business Days except as may be required by federal securities Laws; and (B) in the case of
clause (iii), the Company Shareholders Meeting is not postponed to later than the date that is fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled without
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
so long as the Company Shareholders Meeting is not postponed, recessed or adjourned to a date that is more
than forty-five (45) days after the date on which the Company Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled)
and that the Company will, and will cause its proxy solicitor to, use reasonable best efforts to solicit such
additional proxies (or presence and affirmative vote in person of the Company’s shareholders at the Company
Shareholders Meeting) as expeditiously as reasonably possible, it being understood that time shall be of the
essence. If, on any date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Common Shares to obtain the Minority
Shareholder Approval, the Company will, at Parent’s request, postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders
Meeting on one or more occasions for up to forty-five (45) days in the aggregate to allow for the solicitation of
additional proxies to obtain the Minority Shareholder Approval. The Company will also consider in good faith

other arrangement), or to permit or suffer to exist any material restriction, condition, limitation or requirement, in
each case, that (when taken together with all other such actions, restrictions, conditions, limitations and

(a) Parent agrees that all rights existing as of the Agreement Date to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in favor
of the current and/or former directors, officers or employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
provided in their respective Organizational Documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the Agreement Date will continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to perform their respective obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who was prior to or is as of the Agreement Date, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who was prior to or is as of
the Agreement Date, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another Person (the
“Company Indemnified Persons”), against all claims, Liabilities, Judgments, fines and fees, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any Action (including with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
Transactions)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Person is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer or employee of another Person, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of
any such Action, (i) each Company Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in
the defense of any such Action from the Surviving Company within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the
Surviving Company from the Company Indemnified Person of a request therefor; provided that any Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the Bermuda
Companies Act, the Surviving Company’s Organizational Documents or any applicable indemnification
agreement, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final non-appealable adjudication that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification and (ii) the Surviving Company will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall not (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any Action, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all of the Company Indemnified Persons (who could have
sought indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation from Liabilities in connection with such
Action) from all liability arising out of such Action.
(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company will, and Parent
will cause the Surviving Company to, either maintain or cause to be maintained in effect the current
A-43TABLE OF CONTENTS
policies of directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary liability and employment practices liability insurance
maintained by or for the benefit of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies
(issued by insurers with an A.M. Best financial strength rating of A- or better) for the Company and Company
Subsidiaries and the insured Persons who are covered by such insurance currently maintained by or for benefit
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the “Current Insurance”), in either case, with limits not less than
the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured Persons than the Current
Insurance with respect to claims and matters arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, except that in no event will the Surviving Company be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year more than three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual
premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the Agreement Date (the “Maximum Amount”), and if the
Surviving Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.04(b) it will obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for each year within such six (6)-year period for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option,
purchase “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary liability and employment practices liability insurance for
a period of six (6) years for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the insured Persons who are
covered by Current Insurance, such tail insurance to provide coverage with limits not less than, and to have
other terms not less favorable to the insured Persons than, the Current Insurance with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided that in no event will the aggregate
cost of any such tail insurance exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent will cause the Surviving Company to, and
the Surviving Company will, maintain such insurance policies in full force and effect without any amendment
adverse to the insured Persons thereunder, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(c) The provisions of this Section 6.04 (i) will survive consummation of the Merger until the date that is
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified Persons) to the extent of such
indemnified or insured Person’s interest herein, and his or her heirs and estates and trust vehicles, and (iii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise.
(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that the Company Indemnified Persons may have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance provided by other Persons that are in effect as of the
Agreement Date. Parent hereby agrees that the Surviving Company will be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its
obligations to the Company Indemnified Persons are primary and any obligation of such other Persons to
advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by any such
Company Indemnified Person are secondary). Parent further agrees that no advancement or payment by any of
such other Persons on behalf of any such Company Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which
such Company Indemnified Person has sought indemnification from the Surviving Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall affect the foregoing and such other Persons shall have a right of contribution or be subrogated
to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Company Indemnified
Person against the Surviving Company or any Company Subsidiary, as applicable.
(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent and the Surviving Company will cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company assume Parent and/or the Surviving
Company’s obligations (as applicable) set forth in this Section 6.04.
(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to
claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement.

(a) Until the one (1)-year anniversary of the Closing, (the “Continuation Period”), Parent will cause the
Surviving Company to provide each Company Employee who continues to remain employed with Parent, an
Affiliate of Parent or the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time with (i) a base salary or

Company or any Subsidiaries of Parent or the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time.
(b) If requested by Parent in a writing delivered to the Company not less than five (5) Business Days
before the anticipated Closing Date, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable
plan or arrangement, the Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take
such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the 401(k) plans sponsored by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (collectively, the “Company 401(k) Plan”), effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and
provide that participants in the Company 401(k) Plan shall become fully vested in any unvested portion of their
Company 401(k) Plan accounts as of the date such plan is terminated. In the event that Parent requests that the
Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall, not later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time, provide Parent with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan will be terminated, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, pursuant to resolution of the Company Board (or the appropriate
committee thereof), the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent at least

communication and a copy or, if oral, the substance thereof and shall require the Company’s consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to disseminating any such communications.
(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide each Company Employee who incurs a
termination of employment during the Continuation Period with severance payments and benefits that are no
less favorable than the severance payments and benefits that would be required to be provided to such
Company Employee under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect as of the Closing Date. The Parties agree to
treat the Transactions as a “change in control” or “change of control” for purposes of determining severance
entitlements under Company Benefit Plans.
(e) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits under any employee benefit
plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries (exclusive of the Company) in which any Company Employee becomes
eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date (the “New Plans”), Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to, provide each Company Employee with credit for his or her years of service with the

shall not be required to apply (x) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service or (y) with respect to any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, cause each Company Employee to be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits,
and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing

Closing Date occurs, Parent shall or shall cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (x) cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents and (y) cause any eligible expenses incurred by any
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year during which the
Closing Date occurs to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New
Plan.
(f) With respect to annual bonus amounts for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 (the “Current Year
Bonus”), to the extent not paid prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause each employee of the Company
who was employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to be paid, on the Company’s regularly
scheduled annual bonus payment date in 2023 (subject to such employee’s continued employment through
such annual bonus payment date), the full amount of the Current Year Bonus that is actually earned by such
employee as of the payment date for the Current Year Bonus; provided that (i) the Current Year Bonus paid to
employees at the level of Vice President or below shall in no event be less than the target amount and (ii) the
Current Year Bonus paid to employees above the level of Vice President shall be determined based on the
performance goals established by the Company in the ordinary course at the beginning of the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2023, shall take into account partial attainment of performance goals consistent with historical
practice, and shall not be discretionarily reduced based on individual performance factors without approval,
prior to the Effective Time, by the principal executive officer of the Company and the Compensation Committee
of the Company Board. In addition, in the event of an employee’s termination of employment after the Effective
Time and before the payment date of the Current Year Bonus under circumstances entitling the employee to
severance (the date of such termination, the “Early Departure Date”), such employee will become entitled to a
pro-rated target annual bonus on the date of termination, determined by multiplying the target bonus for the full
fiscal year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of days from April 1, 2022 through the Early
Departure Date and the denominator of which is 365, and Parent shall cause such pro-rated target annual bonus
amount to be paid as soon as practicable following the Early Departure Date and in no event later than the
regular payment date (provided that the amount payable pursuant to this provision shall be in full satisfaction of
any requirement to pay a Current Year Bonus pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan but, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not reduce the amount of any severance payment computed by reference to target or prior year
bonuses contemplated elsewhere in any Company Benefit Plan).
(g) No provision of this Agreement will (i) create any right in any Company Employee or any other
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to continued employment by the Surviving Company or
its Subsidiaries, or preclude the ability of the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any employee for any reason; (ii) require the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to continue any particular Company Benefit Plans or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Closing Date; or (iii) be treated as an amendment to any employee benefit plan of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.07, and any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 6.08 will create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Person, including any Company Employee.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section
8.01, this Agreement will forthwith become void and have no effect, without any Liability on the part of the
Parties (or any shareholder or Representative of a Party), other than Liability arising from a breach of the final
sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.04, this Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article IX, which provisions will
survive such termination of this Agreement; provided that, other than where Parent receives payment of the
Termination Fee, in which case the Company and the Company Related Parties will have no further Liability to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates as set forth in Section 8.02(c), nothing herein will relieve a Party
from Liability resulting from such Party’s Fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, “willful and material breach” means an intentional breach by a Party of this Agreement that is a
consequence of an act or an omission undertaken or omitted by the breaching Party with the actual knowledge
that the taking of such act or omission would result in such breach; it being acknowledged and agreed, without
limitation, that any failure by any Party to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions after the
applicable conditions thereto have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at such time) will constitute
a willful and material breach of this Agreement.
(b) The Company will pay to Parent a fee of $55,250,000 (the “Termination Fee”) if:
(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f); or
(ii) (A) after the Agreement Date but prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01, an Alternative Proposal is made by a third party to the Company or the Special Committee and not
withdrawn (publicly if such Alternative Proposal has been made known publicly) prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting or is made directly to the Company’s shareholders by a third party and not publicly
withdrawn prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting; (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (but in the case of a termination by the Company,
only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the
second proviso to Section 8.01(b)(i)), by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii); and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination, (x) the Company
enters into a definitive Contract for an Alternative Proposal and such Alternative Proposal is consummated
(whether during or after such twelve (12)-month period) or (y) an Alternative Proposal is consummated (in
the case of (x) or (y), with the approval of a majority of the independent directors on the Company Board);
provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 8.02(b)(ii), the references to 15% in the definition of
“Alternative Proposal” will be deemed to be references to 50%.

Any Termination Fee due under this Section 8.02(b)(ii) will be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the
case of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d), substantially concurrently with and not later than
the next Business Day following such termination; (y) in the case of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(f), on the Business Day immediately following the date of such termination; and (z) in the case of clause
(ii) above, on the date of consummation as referred to in clause (ii)(C) above.
(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.02 are an integral part of
the Transactions and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee as and when due to Parent pursuant to
this Section 8.02, it will also be obligated to pay any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Parent and its
Affiliates in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee (the “Costs and Expenses”), together with interest on the amount of any
unpaid Termination Fee and Costs and Expenses from the date such Termination Fee and/or Costs and Expense
was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date at the prime rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal
on the date that such Termination Fee was required to be paid (the “Interest”). If Parent receives payment of the
Termination Fee (and if payable pursuant to this Section 8.02, the Costs and Expenses and/or Interest) under the
circumstances in which it is payable as provided in this Section 8.02, the receipt of the Termination Fee, together
with the Costs and Expenses and/or Interest, if payable pursuant to this Section 8.02, will be (i) the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective direct or indirect former, current or future general or limited partners, shareholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
“Company Related Parties”) for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for any breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise, and upon payment of such amount (in circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable), none of
the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation whatsoever relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) deemed to be liquidated damages
for any and all damages or losses suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement (or any matter forming the basis for such
termination), and neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates will be entitled to bring any
Action or otherwise be entitled to any remedy against the Company or any of its Affiliates, at law or in equity or
otherwise, arising from or in connection with this Agreement (including the termination thereof) or any of the
Transactions. Any payment of the Termination Fee made by the Company will be payable only once and not in
duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more provisions of this Section 8.02.

Company’s shareholders will be made without the further approval of such shareholders, and (b) except as provided

Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit, Schedule or Annex but not otherwise defined therein has the
meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are
used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “will” and
“will not” are expressions of command and not merely expressions of future intent or expectation. The words
“hereof,” “hereto,” “hereby,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement will
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term “or” is not
exclusive. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” will mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such

phrase will not mean simply “if.” The following general rules apply: the singular number will include the plural, and
vice versa; the masculine gender will include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender will include the
masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender will include the masculine and feminine genders. Any Law
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein will include any modification,
amendment or re-enactment thereof, and any Law substituted therefor, in each case, as of the time of inquiry,
representation, or covenant and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued or related to such Law. Any
reference to a Governmental Entity will be also deemed to refer to any successor thereto unless the context requires
otherwise. A reference to any agreement (including this Agreement), or Contract is, unless otherwise specified, to the
agreement, or Contract as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced at the time of inquiry, representation or
covenant. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Schedules or Exhibits is intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included
or other items, are or are not material, and no Party will use the fact of setting of such amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of such item in the Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between or among the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. References herein to a
Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to “$”
will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of America. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, when calculating the period of time within which, or following which, any act is to be done or step
taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference day in calculating such period shall be excluded and
if the last day of the period is not a Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next Business Day or if any
action must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such action may be validly taken on
or by the next day that is a Business Day. References to a number of days, shall refer to calendar days unless
Business Days are specified. References to the “ordinary course of business” or words of similar import shall, in each
case, be deemed to mean the ordinary course of business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, consistent
with past practice; provided that any action taken, or omitted to be taken, and any adjustments and modifications
thereto taken in good faith in response to or as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures shall be deemed to
be in the “ordinary course of business.”

be represented by, independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had the full right and opportunity to
consult with its respective attorney(s), that to the extent, if any, that it desired, it availed itself of this right and
opportunity, that it or its authorized officers (as the case may be) have carefully read and fully understand this
Agreement in its entirety and have had it fully explained to them by such Party’s respective counsel, and that it or its
authorized officer (as the case may be) is competent to execute this Agreement and has executed this Agreement free
from coercion, duress or undue influence. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement in connection with the Transactions, with the opportunity to seek advice as to their legal rights from such
counsel. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement is to be construed as
jointly drafted by the Parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof is to arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or by reason of the extent to which any such
provision is inconsistent with any prior draft hereof.

as and when due (collectively, the “Guaranteed Obligations”), whether now or hereafter made, incurred or created,
whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, and however arising under this Agreement. This

(b) SMP promises and undertakes to make all payments hereunder without deduction or offset for any
defense, claim, or counterclaim of SMP of any kind.
(c) The guarantee set forth in Section 9.12(a) (the “Guarantee”) is an absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and
continuing (irrespective of any modification, waiver, amendment, restatement or consent to departure from any terms
of this Agreement that may be agreed to by Parent or Merger Sub) guarantee of the full and punctual payment by

Share Awards, or to the Company Indemnified Parties. Claims hereunder may be made on one or more occasions.
(d) SMP agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations will not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or
otherwise affected or impaired by (i) the failure or delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or

asserts rights as a result of such failure or delay that are not the subject of subclause (iv) of this Section 9.12(d); (ii)

insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub; (v) any request or
acceptance of other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations or the taking or holding of security for the payment of

Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) the exercise of other rights or remedies available to the Company or the other
beneficiaries, or any of them, under this Agreement, at law or in equity, except to the extent Parent or Merger Sub
successfully asserts rights as a result of such exercise that are not the subject of subclause (iv) of this Section

expressly a party to for purposes of this Agreement, SMP; (ix) any lack of legality, validity or enforceability of the
Guaranteed Obligations, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or referred to herein; or (x)

or otherwise, that are or might be in conflict with the terms of the guarantee set forth in this Section 9.12, any legal or
equitable discharge of SMP’s obligations hereunder and defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that
are available to Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement). SMP acknowledges that it has received and will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the Transactions and that the waivers set forth in this Section 9.12 are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

(e) No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power
pursuant to this Section 9.12 will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise by the Company of
any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 9.12 preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or
power pursuant to this Section 9.12. Each and every right, remedy and power granted to the Company pursuant to

Company.

performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary action, and no other proceedings on the
part of SMP or its stockholders are necessary to authorize this Agreement, and do not contravene any provision of
SMP’s Organizational Documents or any Law or contractual restriction binding on SMP or its assets; (ii) this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of SMP enforceable against SMP in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent
transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to the effect of
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in an Action at law or in equity); and (iii) SMP will not
issue any press release or other communication in contravention of Section 6.07.
(g) In the event that all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations is paid by Parent or Merger Sub, the
obligations of SMP hereunder will be reinstated in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) is rescinded or
recovered directly or indirectly from the Company or any other beneficiary as a preference, fraudulent transfer or
otherwise, and any such payments that are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guaranteed Obligations.
(h) Nothing in this Section 9.12 will waive any defenses, counterclaims, or rights of setoff that Parent or
Merger Sub may have under this Agreement or applicable Law.

multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option; provided
that each unexercised Company Option, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise price equal to or
greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration will be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time
without consideration therefor.

Merger Consideration, multiplied by (B) the total number of Company Common Shares subject to such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c)
Each then-outstanding Company PSU that has not been settled in Company Common Shares prior to the
Effective Time will be cancelled and the holder thereof will only have the right to receive an amount (subject
to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, multiplied by (B) the total number of Company Common Shares subject to such
Company PSU (deeming performance goals as being satisfied) immediately prior to the Effective Time.

constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the United States Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that is not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time
without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment will be made at the
earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Share Award that will not trigger a Tax or penalty
