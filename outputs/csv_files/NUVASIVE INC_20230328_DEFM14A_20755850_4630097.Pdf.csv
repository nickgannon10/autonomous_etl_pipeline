Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Globus Class A Common Stock.

Table of Contents
Approval of the Globus Share Issuance Proposal by Globus stockholders is a condition to the completion of the Merger. Approval of the
Globus Adjournment Proposal is not a condition to the obligation of either Globus or NuVasive to complete the Merger.
Each Globus stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Globus Class A Common Stock held of record at the close of business on the
Globus Record Date on each proposal and ten votes for each share of Globus Class B Common Stock held of record at the close of business on the
Globus Record Date on each proposal. Only Globus stockholders of record at the close of business on the Globus Record Date are entitled to
receive notice of and to vote at the Globus Special Meeting and any and all adjournments or postponements thereof.
A quorum of Globus stockholders is necessary to conduct business at the Globus Special Meeting. The holders of a majority of the voting
power of the issued and outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock entitled to vote at the Globus Special Meeting must be present in person or
represented by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Globus Special Meeting. Abstentions will count as votes
present and entitled to vote for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Globus Special Meeting.
Since all of the proposals currently expected to be voted on at the Globus Special Meeting are considered non-routine and non-discretionary
matters, shares held in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee are not expected to be counted as present for the purpose of
determining the existence of a quorum if such broker, bank or other nominee does not have instructions to vote on any such proposals. Pursuant to
the Voting Agreement, the Supporting Stockholders are obligated to cause the shares of Globus Class B Common Stock subject to the Voting
Agreement to be counted as present at the Globus Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum. Such shares are sufficient to constitute a
quorum.
Globus Proposal 1: Globus Share Issuance Proposal
Assuming a quorum is present at the Globus Special Meeting, approval of the Globus Share Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Globus Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Globus Special Meeting.
Any shares not present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a Globus stockholder who holds shares in “street name”
through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions with respect to any proposals at the Globus Special Meeting to such bank,
broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, provided that a quorum is otherwise present.
An abstention by any Globus Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Globus Special Meeting on the Globus Share Issuance Proposal
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Globus Share Issuance Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the Globus
Share Issuance Proposal.
Globus Proposal 2: Globus Adjournment Proposal
Approval of the Globus Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Globus
Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Globus Special Meeting.
If a quorum is not present or represented at the Globus Special Meeting, then the Globus stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the meeting.
Any shares not present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a Globus stockholder who holds shares in “street name”
through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions with respect to any proposals at the Globus Special Meeting to such bank,
broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Globus Adjournment Proposal. An abstention by any Globus Common Stock
present or

Compensation Proposal and the NuVasive Adjournment Proposal are not conditions to the obligation of either Globus or NuVasive to complete the
Merger.
Each NuVasive stockholder is entitled to one vote on each proposal for each share of NuVasive Common Stock held of record at the close of
business on the NuVasive Record Date. Only NuVasive stockholders of record at the close of business on the NuVasive Record Date are entitled to
receive notice of and to vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting and any and all adjournments or postponements thereof.

shares of NuVasive Common Stock entitled to vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy in order to

Special Meeting will constitute presence in person for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the
NuVasive Special Meeting. Abstentions will count as votes present and entitled to vote for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for
the transaction of business at the NuVasive Special Meeting. Since all of the proposals currently expected to be voted on at the NuVasive Special
Meeting are considered non-routine and non-discretionary matters, shares held in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee are not
expected to be counted as present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum if such broker, bank or other nominee does not have
instructions to vote on at least one of the proposals brought before the NuVasive Special Meeting.

Assuming a quorum is present at the NuVasive Special Meeting, approval of the NuVasive Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the

received by NuVasive in connection with any of the foregoing and the identity of the person or group making any such request, acquisition
proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place. NuVasive has agreed to substantially concurrently provide to
Globus any non-public information concerning itself or its subsidiaries provided to any other person or group in connection with any NuVasive
Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided to Globus. NuVasive has agreed to keep Globus reasonably informed, on a reasonably

Voting Agreement (Page 142)
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on February 8, 2023, Globus and NuVasive entered into the Voting Agreement with
the Supporting Stockholders.
Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, until the earliest to occur of (a) the Effective Time, (b) a Globus Adverse Recommendation Change, (c)
receipt of the approval of Globus stockholders for the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, and (d) such date and time as the Merger Agreement is
validly terminated (which we refer to collectively as the “Expiration Time”), at every meeting of Globus stockholders at which the Globus Share
Issuance Proposal is to be voted on (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), and on any action or approval of Globus stockholders by
written consent with respect to the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, the Supporting Stockholders are required to vote all of their shares of Globus
Common Stock in accordance with the recommendation of the Globus Board with respect to the Globus Share Issuance Proposal as of the time of the
Globus Special Meeting.
Until the Expiration Time, at every meeting of Globus stockholders (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), the Supporting
Stockholders are required to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting (or cause the holders of record on any applicable record date to
be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Supporting Stockholders’ shares of Globus Common Stock to be counted as
present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
In addition, the Supporting Stockholders agreed to certain restrictions on transfer, to use their reasonable best efforts to assist and cooperate
in obtaining the approval of the Merger under the HSR Act and not to take any action that Globus is prohibited from taking under the non-
solicitation restrictions applicable to it under the Merger Agreement (or permit any entity under their control to take such actions).
The Voting Agreement provides that NuVasive’s right to receive the one-time payment of the termination fee from Globus pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement will be NuVasive’s sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Voting Agreement or any breach of
any covenant or obligation of the Supporting Stockholders contained in the Voting Agreement, and that NuVasive is not entitled to seek specific
performance in respect of the Supporting Stockholders’ obligations under the Voting Agreement. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the shares of Globus Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement represent approximately 70% of the total voting power
of outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock. Even though a special meeting is required to be held and all Globus stockholders of record on the
Globus Record Date have a right to vote on the proposals presented at the Globus Special Meeting, the shares of Globus Class B Common Stock
subject to the Voting Agreement will be sufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus Adjournment Proposal.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 160)
NuVasive and Globus intend for the Merger to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. NuVasive and Globus must use reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion from external counsel, dated as of the closing date,
to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the Merger will qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming the Merger so qualifies, U.S. holders (as defined in the section titled
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) of shares of NuVasive Common Stock generally will not recognize any gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon receipt of Globus Class A Common Stock in exchange for NuVasive Common Stock in the Merger,
other than gain or loss, if any, with respect to any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Globus Class A Common Stock.
The material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders are discussed in more detail in the section titled “Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.” The discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences contained in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus is intended to provide only a general discussion and is not a complete analysis or description of all potential U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Such consequences may vary with, or be dependent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it
does not address the effects of any foreign, state or local tax laws or any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws.
TAX MATTERS ARE COMPLICATED AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN
SITUATION. YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF THE
MERGER TO YOU IN YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
Comparison of Stockholders’ Rights (Page 163)
Upon completion of the Merger, NuVasive stockholders receiving shares of Globus Class A Common Stock will become Globus stockholders.
The rights of Globus stockholders, including the holders of Globus Class A Common Stock, will be governed by the DGCL and the Globus charter
and Globus bylaws in effect at the Effective Time. Both Globus and NuVasive are Delaware corporations, but there are certain differences in the
rights of Globus stockholders under the Globus charter and Globus bylaws and of NuVasive stockholders under the NuVasive charter and NuVasive
bylaws. See the section titled “Comparison of Stockholders’ Rights.”
Listing of Globus Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of NuVasive Common Stock (Page 110)
It is a condition to the Merger that the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock to be issued to NuVasive stockholders in the Merger be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. If the Merger is completed, NuVasive Common Stock will be delisted from
Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, following which NuVasive will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with
respect to NuVasive Common Stock.
Risk Factors (Page 22)
In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the Share Issuance you should carefully read this joint proxy statement/prospectus and

Litigation Relating to the Merger (Page 110) 
As of March 23, 2023 and since the filing of the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus on March 13, 2023, NuVasive and its directors
have been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a purported NuVasive stockholder alleging that the defendants filed or caused to be filed a
materially incomplete and misleading preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, including to enjoin the
Merger, rescission of the Merger Agreement or rescissory damages in the event the Merger is consummated, and an award of attorneys’ fees, in
addition to other relief. NuVasive and Globus believe that the claims asserted in the lawsuit are without merit. See “The Merger—Litigation Relating

The market prices of Globus Class A Common Stock and NuVasive Common Stock have fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the
Merger Agreement and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the date of the NuVasive Special Meeting
and the date the Merger is completed and thereafter (in the case of Globus Class A Common Stock).
The number of shares of Globus Class A Common Stock that NuVasive stockholders will receive as consideration per share of NuVasive
Common Stock in the Merger is fixed and will not change.
The value of the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock to be received in exchange for each share of NuVasive Common Stock when
received by NuVasive stockholders after the Merger is completed could be greater than, less than or the same as shown in the table above.
Accordingly, Globus stockholders and NuVasive stockholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for Globus Class A Common Stock
and NuVasive Common Stock in determining whether to vote in favor of the proposals at the NuVasive Special Meeting and Globus Special Meeting,
including the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, in the case of Globus stockholders, or the NuVasive Merger Proposal, in the case of NuVasive
stockholders.
On March 3, 2023, there were 52,348,291 shares of NuVasive Common Stock outstanding and approximately 67 stockholders of record.
On March 3, 2023, there were 77,882,271 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock outstanding, 22,430,097 shares of Globus Class B Common
Stock outstanding, approximately 34 stockholders of record for Globus Class A Common Stock and two stockholders of record for Globus Class B
Common Stock.

operation, and expansion of its business, and does not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.

In considering how to vote on the proposals to be considered and voted on at the Globus Special Meeting or the NuVasive Special Meeting, you
are urged to carefully consider all of the information contained or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For more
information, see “Where You Can Find More Information.” You should also read and consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of
Globus and NuVasive because those risks may affect the Combined Company. The risks associated with the business of Globus can be found in
Globus’s Exchange Act reports, including Globus’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which are incorporated
by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The risks associated with the business of NuVasive can be found in NuVasive’s Exchange Act
reports, including NuVasive’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which are incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, you are urged to carefully consider the following material risks relating to the Merger and the businesses
of Globus, NuVasive and the Combined Company.

The Exchange Ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either Globus’s or NuVasive’s stock price. Therefore, NuVasive
shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive.
Upon completion of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of NuVasive Common Stock (other than cancelled shares) will be converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration, which is equal to 0.75 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Globus Class A Common Stock (and, if
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares) (subject to adjustments in the event of any stock split or similar change to the number of shares of NuVasive
Common Stock or Globus Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of specified events, as specified in the
Merger Agreement). This Exchange Ratio was fixed in the Merger Agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either NuVasive
Common Stock or Globus Class A Common Stock. Any change in the market price of Globus Class A Common Stock prior to completion of the Merger
could affect the value of the Merger Consideration that NuVasive stockholders will receive upon completion of the Merger.
It is impossible to accurately predict the market price of Globus Class A Common Stock at the completion of the Merger and, therefore, impossible
to accurately predict the market value of the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock that NuVasive stockholders will receive in the Merger. The market
price for Globus Class A Common Stock may fluctuate both prior to the completion of the Merger and thereafter for a variety of reasons, including, among
others, general market and economic conditions, the demand for Globus’s or NuVasive’s products and services, changes in laws and regulations, other
changes in Globus’s or NuVasive’s respective businesses, operations, prospects and financial results of operations, market assessments of the likelihood
that the Merger will be completed, and the expected timing of the Merger. Many of these factors are beyond Globus’s and NuVasive’s control. As a result,
the market value represented by the Exchange Ratio will also vary.
You are urged to obtain current market quotations for shares of Globus Class A Common Stock and NuVasive Common Stock. The market price of
Globus Class A Common Stock will continue to fluctuate after the Merger.
Upon completion of the Merger, NuVasive stockholders will become holders of Globus Class A Common Stock. The market price of the Globus
Class A Common Stock will continue to fluctuate, potentially significantly, following completion of the Merger, including for the reasons described above.
As a result, former NuVasive stockholders could lose some or all of the value of their investment in Globus Class A Common Stock. In addition, any
significant price or volume fluctuations in the stock market generally could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the Globus
Class A Common Stock received in the Merger, regardless of the Combined Company’s actual operating performance.

The Merger may not be completed and the Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.
The Merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied (or waived, to the extent permitted), including (i) the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by NuVasive stockholders; (ii) approval by Globus stockholders of the issuance of shares of Globus Class A Common Stock in connection
with the Merger; (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting consummation of the Merger; (iv) this registration statement on Form S-4 having been
declared effective by the SEC; (v) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act; (vi) with
respect to a party, accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger
Agreement; (vii) compliance by each party in all material respects with such other party’s obligations under the Merger Agreement; and (viii) with respect
to a party, the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party since February 8, 2023. These conditions are described in the section titled “The
Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Consummation of the Merger.” These conditions to the completion of the Merger, some of which are beyond the
control of Globus and NuVasive, may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may be delayed or not
completed.
Additionally, either Globus or NuVasive may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, subject to the payment of a termination
fee in certain cases. The Merger Agreement provides that NuVasive will pay Globus a termination fee of:
 
•
$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Globus, at any time prior to obtaining the NuVasive Stockholder Approval, as a result
of NuVasive committing an intentional and material breach of its non-solicitation or board recommendation obligations as described in the
sections “The Merger Agreement—Obligations to Recommend the Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Approval of the Globus
Share Issuance Proposal” and “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation”;
 
•
$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Globus, at any time prior to obtaining the NuVasive Stockholder Approval, as a result
of the NuVasive Board or any committee thereof (A) making an adverse recommendation change with respect to the NuVasive Merger
Proposal, (B) not including the recommendation of the NuVasive Board in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or (C) publicly proposing or
allowing NuVasive to publicly propose to take any of the actions in clause (A) or (B) of this bullet point;
 
•
$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by NuVasive, at any time prior to obtaining NuVasive Stockholder Approval, in order to
enter into a definitive agreement with a third party providing for a NuVasive Superior Proposal; and
 
•
$60 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by either Globus or NuVasive, if the NuVasive Stockholder Approval is not obtained and
there has not been an adverse recommendation change by the NuVasive Board.
The Merger Agreement provides that Globus will pay NuVasive a termination fee of:
 
•
$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by NuVasive, at any time prior to obtaining the Globus Stockholder Approval, as a result
of Globus committing an intentional and material breach of its non-solicitation obligations as described in “The Merger Agreement—No
Solicitation”;
 
•
$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by NuVasive, at any time prior to obtaining the Globus Stockholder approval for the
Globus Share Issuance Proposal, as a result of the Globus Board or any committee thereof (A) making an adverse recommendation change
with respect to the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, (B) not including the recommendation of the Globus Board in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or (C) publicly proposing or allowing Globus to publicly propose to take any of the actions in clause (A) or (B) of this
bullet point;

more complete discussion of the circumstances under which the Merger Agreement could be terminated and when a termination fee may be payable by
Globus or NuVasive.
Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the future business and financial results of Globus and NuVasive and the trading prices of
the Globus Class A Common Stock or NuVasive Common Stock.
If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including because Globus stockholders fail to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, or
because NuVasive stockholders fail to approve the NuVasive Merger Proposal, the ongoing businesses of Globus and NuVasive may be adversely
affected and, without realizing any of the expected benefits of having completed the Merger, Globus and NuVasive would be subject to a number of risks,
including the following:
 
•
each company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price;
 
•
each company may experience negative reactions from its customers, partners, suppliers and employees;
 
•
each company will have incurred substantial costs towards completion of the Merger and will generally be required to pay its respective
costs relating to the Merger, such as financial advisory, legal, accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the
Merger is completed;
 
•
there may be disruptions to each company’s respective business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, and any
adverse changes in their relationships with their respective customers, partners, suppliers, surgeons, other business partners, contractors
and employees may continue or intensify; and
 
•
each company will have committed substantial time and resources to matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) which
would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to either company as
an independent company.
The market price for shares of Globus Class A Common Stock may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically have
affected or currently affect the market price of shares of NuVasive Common Stock.
Upon completion of the Merger, NuVasive stockholders will receive shares of Globus Class A Common Stock and will accordingly become Globus
stockholders. Globus’s business differs from that of NuVasive, and Globus’s results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected by factors
different from those that historically have affected or currently affect NuVasive’s results of operations and stock price. Following the completion of the
Merger, NuVasive will be part of a larger company, so decisions affecting NuVasive may be made in respect of the larger combined business as a whole
rather than the NuVasive business individually. For a discussion of the businesses of each of Globus and NuVasive and some important factors to
consider in connection with those businesses, see the section titled “The Parties to the Merger” and the other information contained or incorporated in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the section titled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
The Share Issuance may cause the market price of Globus Class A Common Stock to decline.
Based on 52,348,291 shares of NuVasive Common Stock issued and outstanding as of March 3, 2023, and the Exchange Ratio, it is expected that
Globus will issue approximately 39.3 million shares of Globus Class A
 
-24-
Table of Contents
Common Stock in the Merger. Former NuVasive stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock that they will receive in
the Merger, and Globus stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in Globus as a result of the changes to Globus’s investment profile as a result
of the Merger. Both the issuance of this amount of new shares in the Merger and any subsequent sales of these shares may cause the market price of
Globus Class A Common Stock to decline.
NuVasive stockholders who receive shares of Globus Class A Common Stock in the Merger will have rights as Globus stockholders that differ from
their current rights as NuVasive stockholders.
Upon completion of the Merger, NuVasive stockholders will no longer be stockholders of NuVasive and will instead become stockholders of
Globus. Both Globus and NuVasive are Delaware corporations, but there are certain differences in the rights of Globus stockholders under the Globus
charter and Globus bylaws and of NuVasive stockholders under the NuVasive charter and NuVasive bylaws. See the section titled “Comparison of
Stockholders’ Rights” for a discussion of these rights.
After the Merger, NuVasive stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in Globus than they currently have in NuVasive
and will exercise less influence over management and policies of the Combined Company.
Each share of Globus Class B Common Stock has ten votes per share while each share of Globus Class A Common Stock has one vote per share.
NuVasive stockholders will have the right to receive shares of Globus Class A Common Stock in the Merger and based on the number of shares of Globus
Class A Common Stock and Globus Class B Common Stock outstanding on March 3, 2023, and the number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock
outstanding on March 3, 2023, upon completion of the Merger, former NuVasive stockholders are expected to own approximately 28% of the voting power
of the issued and outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock and current Globus stockholders are expected to own approximately 72% of the voting
power of the issued and outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock. Consequently, former NuVasive stockholders will have less influence over the
management and policies of the Combined Company than they currently have over the management and policies of NuVasive.
After the Merger, Globus stockholders and NuVasive stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the Combined Company and
may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with their ownership dilution.
The Merger will dilute the ownership position of Globus stockholders and result in NuVasive stockholders having an ownership stake in the
Combined Company. Upon completion of the Merger, each NuVasive stockholder will become a stockholder of Globus with a percentage ownership of the
Combined Company that is smaller than such stockholder’s current percentage ownership of NuVasive. It is expected that the former stockholders of
NuVasive as a group will receive shares in the Merger constituting approximately 28% of the issued and outstanding shares of Globus common stock
immediately after the Merger. Furthermore, because shares of Globus Class A Common Stock will be issued to existing NuVasive stockholders, current
Globus stockholders will have their ownership diluted by approximately 11%.
If the Combined Company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, Globus stockholders
and NuVasive stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies, without receiving any
commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the Combined Company is able to realize only part of the strategic
and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.
The Combined Company will have a controlling stockholder.
As of March 3, 2023, approximately 74% of the outstanding voting power of Globus Common Stock is currently held by David C. Paul, the
Executive Chairman of Globus, and certain of his affiliates, including the
 
-25-
Table of Contents
other Supporting Stockholder, and following consummation of the Merger, Mr. Paul and his affiliates are expected to hold approximately 66% of the
outstanding voting power of the Combined Company. Because of their significant stock ownership, Mr. Paul and his affiliates will be able to exert
substantial control over the Combined Company and its significant corporate decisions. The interests of Mr. Paul and his affiliates might not coincide
with the interests of the other holders of capital stock of Globus, including NuVasive stockholders who receive Globus Class A Common Stock in the
Merger. This concentration of ownership may harm the value of the Globus Class A Common Stock NuVasive stockholders receive in the Merger by,
among other things delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Globus, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business
transaction involving Globus, or causing Globus to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.
Following the Merger, Globus is expected to continue to be a “controlled company.” Under NYSE rules, a “controlled company” may elect not to
comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that a majority of its directors be independent, as defined in NYSE
rules, and the requirement that its compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees consist entirely of independent directors. Globus
relies, and may continue to rely, on the “controlled company” exemption under NYSE rules. As a result, a majority of the members of its board may not be
independent directors and its nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees may not consist entirely of independent directors.
Accordingly, while Globus remains a controlled company and during any transition period following a time when it is no longer a controlled company,
holders of Globus Common Stock may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of NYSE’s corporate
governance requirements.
Until the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms, Globus and NuVasive are each prohibited from
entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to Globus, NuVasive and/or their respective
stockholders.
From and after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant
to its terms, the Merger Agreement restricts Globus and NuVasive from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party and requires that
the businesses of Globus, NuVasive and their respective subsidiaries be conducted in the ordinary course. These restrictions may prevent Globus or
NuVasive, as applicable, from taking actions during the pendency of the Merger that would have been beneficial. Adverse effects arising from these
restrictions during the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger
Agreement. See the section titled “The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Pending the Merger.”
Obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the Merger, and regulatory approval may not be
received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.
The Merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement. These closing conditions include, among others,
(1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by NuVasive stockholders; (2) approval by Globus stockholders of the issuance of shares of Globus Class A
Common Stock in connection with the Merger; (3) the absence of any law or order prohibiting consummation of the Merger; (4) this registration
statement on Form S-4 having been declared effective by the SEC; (5) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension
thereof) under the HSR Act; (6) with respect to a party, accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality
standards set forth in the Merger Agreement; (7) with respect to a party, compliance by the other party in all material respects with such other party’s
obligations under the Merger Agreement; and (8) with respect to a party, the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party since February 8,
2023. No assurance can be given that the required stockholder approvals and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any
extension thereof) under the HSR Act can be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required approvals are
obtained and the required conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the
 
-26-
Table of Contents
terms, conditions and timing of such approvals. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause the Combined Company not to realize, or to be delayed
in realizing, some or all of the benefits that Globus and NuVasive expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.
For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to completion of the Merger, see the sections titled “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Consummation of the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Approvals.”
Failure to attract, motivate and retain executives and other key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Merger.
The success of the Merger will depend in part on the Combined Company’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of the professionals
currently employed by Globus and NuVasive. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with Globus or NuVasive, as applicable, while
the Merger is pending, or with the Combined Company. If key employees of either company terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of
employees or sales representatives are retained to maintain effective operations, the Combined Company’s business activities may be adversely affected
and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating Globus and NuVasive to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause
the Combined Company’s business to suffer. In addition, Globus and NuVasive may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees
that leave either company or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms. Moreover, there could be disruptions to or distractions for
the workforce and management, including disruptions associated with integrating employees into the Combined Company. No assurance can be given
that the Combined Company will be able to attract or retain key employees of Globus and NuVasive to the same extent that those companies have been
able to attract or retain their own employees in the past.
The Merger, and uncertainty regarding the Merger, may cause business partners, surgeons, vendors or other stakeholders to delay or defer decisions
concerning Globus or NuVasive and adversely affect each company’s ability to effectively manage its respective business, which could adversely
affect each company’s business, operating results and financial position and, following the completion of the Merger, the Combined Company’s
business, operating results and financial position.
The Merger will happen only if the stated conditions are met, including the approval of the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, the approval of the
NuVasive Merger Proposal and the receipt of the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act
can be obtained, among other conditions. Many of the conditions are beyond the control of Globus and NuVasive, and both parties also have certain
rights to terminate the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty regarding the completion of the Merger. This uncertainty may cause
existing or prospective business partners, surgeons, vendors and other stakeholders, including sales representatives, to:
 
•
delay or defer other decisions concerning Globus, NuVasive or the Combined Company, including entering into contracts with Globus or
NuVasive or making other decisions concerning Globus or NuVasive or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with Globus
or NuVasive; or
 
•
otherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with Globus, NuVasive or the Combined Company.
Any such disruptions such as delays or deferrals of those decisions or changes in existing agreements could adversely affect the respective
business, operating results and financial position of Globus and NuVasive, whether the Merger is ultimately completed, and following the completion of
the Merger, the Combined Company, including an adverse effect on the Combined Company’s ability to realize the anticipated synergies and other
benefits of the Merger. The risk, and adverse effect, of any such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger or termination
of the Merger Agreement.
 
-27-
Table of Contents
Whether or not the Merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in the businesses of Globus and
NuVasive, which could have an adverse effect on their respective businesses and financial results.
Whether or not the Merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in the businesses of Globus and
NuVasive, including by diverting the attention of Globus and NuVasive’s respective management and employee teams, such as those involved in day-to-
day operations and sales, toward the completion of the Merger. In addition, Globus and NuVasive have each diverted significant management resources
in an effort to complete the Merger and are each subject to restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of their respective businesses.
If the Merger is not completed, Globus and NuVasive will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which
they will have received little or no benefit.
NuVasive directors and executive officers have interests and arrangements that may be different from, or in addition to, those of NuVasive
stockholders generally.
When considering the recommendations of the NuVasive Board on how to vote on the proposals described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, NuVasive stockholders should be aware that NuVasive’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are
different from, or in addition to, those of NuVasive stockholders generally. These interests include, among others, acceleration of the equity awards held
by NuVasive non-employee directors upon the consummation of the Merger, “double-trigger” vesting of NuVasive equity awards and severance benefits
in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the Merger, participation in the NuVasive Excise Tax Gross-Up Plan, Globus’s
agreement to add three current members of the NuVasive Board to the Globus Board and rights to continuing indemnification and directors’ and officers’
liability insurance. The NuVasive Board was aware of and considered these interests when it determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of NuVasive and its stockholders, and recommended that
NuVasive stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. The interests of NuVasive directors and executive officers are described in more detail in the section
titled “Interests of NuVasive Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might be willing to pay more to acquire or
merge with either Globus or NuVasive.
The Merger Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that restrict the ability of Globus and NuVasive to, among other things (each as
described in the sections titled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation”), subject to limited exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement:
 
•
in the case of NuVasive: (i) initiate, seek or solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate or take any other action that is reasonably expected
to promote, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a NuVasive Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-
public information or data relating to, NuVasive or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of NuVasive, or
any of its subsidiaries to any person that has made or could reasonably be expected to make, or in connection with, a NuVasive Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement, with respect to a NuVasive Acquisition Proposal.
 
•
in the case of Globus: (i) initiate, seek or solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate or take any other action that is reasonably expected to
promote, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Globus Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public
information or data relating to, Globus or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of Globus, or any of its
subsidiaries to any person that has made or could
 
-28-
Table of Contents
reasonably be expected to make, or in connection with, a Globus Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreement, including any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement, with
respect to a Globus Acquisition Proposal.
Furthermore, there are limited exceptions to the requirement under the Merger Agreement that neither the Globus Board nor the NuVasive Board
withdraw or modify the Globus Board Recommendation or the NuVasive Board Recommendation, as applicable (see the section titled “The Merger
Agreement—Obligations to Recommend the Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Approval of the Globus Share Issuance Proposal ”). Although
the Globus Board or NuVasive Board is permitted to effect a change of recommendation, after complying with certain procedures set forth in the Merger
Agreement, in response to certain superior offers or if the applicable board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel,
that a failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, such change of recommendation would entitle the other party
to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive a termination fee from the party making a change of recommendation. See the sections titled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”
These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer from considering or proposing an acquisition or merger, even if it were prepared
to pay consideration with a higher value than that implied by the merger consideration in the Merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer
proposing to pay a lower per share price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee.
Globus and NuVasive expect to incur substantial costs related to the Merger and integration.
Globus and NuVasive have incurred and expect to incur non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies, as
well as transaction fees and other costs related to the Merger. Such costs include, among others, filing and registration fees with the SEC, printing and
mailing costs associated with this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and legal, accounting, investment banking, consulting, public relations and proxy
solicitation fees. Some of these costs are payable by Globus or NuVasive regardless of whether the Merger is completed.
The Combined Company will also incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the Merger. There are processes, policies,
procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Merger and the integration of NuVasive’s business into
the Combined Company. Although Globus expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits and additional income, as well as the
realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction, Merger-related and restructuring costs
over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. While Globus has assumed that certain expenses would be incurred in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, there are many factors beyond Globus’s control that could affect the
total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses.
Neither Globus stockholders nor NuVasive stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights in the Merger.
Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders of a corporation to dissent from certain extraordinary
transactions, such as a merger in certain circumstances, and to demand that such corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court
in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to such stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the
DGCL, stockholders generally do not have appraisal rights if the shares of stock they hold are either listed on a national securities exchange or held of
record by more than 2,000 holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are available if stockholders are required by the terms of the Merger
Agreement to accept for their shares anything other than (a) shares of stock of the surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another corporation that
will either be listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares or (d) any
combination of the foregoing.
 
-29-
Table of Contents
Because the Merger consists of Merger Sub merging with and into NuVasive, holders of Globus Common Stock will continue to hold their Globus
shares following completion of the Merger and therefore holders of Globus Common Stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
Merger.
Because NuVasive stockholders hold shares of stock that are listed on Nasdaq and are required under the Merger Agreement to accept only shares
of another corporation listed on a national securities exchange and cash in lieu of fractional shares, they will not entitled to appraisal rights in connection
with the Merger. See the section titled “No Appraisal Rights.” 
Lawsuits may in the future be filed against Globus, NuVasive, and members of their respective boards of directors, challenging the Merger, and an
adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame.
Transactions such as the Merger are frequently subject to litigation or other legal proceedings, including actions alleging that the Globus Board or
NuVasive Board breached their respective fiduciary duties to their stockholders by entering into the Merger Agreement, by failing to obtain a greater
value in the transaction for their stockholders or otherwise. See the section titled “The Merger—Litigation Relating to the Merger.” Neither Globus nor
NuVasive can provide assurance that such litigation or other legal proceedings will not be brought. If litigation or other legal proceedings are in fact
brought against Globus or NuVasive, or against the Globus Board or NuVasive Board, they will defend against it, but might not be successful in doing so.
An adverse outcome in such matters, as well as the costs and efforts of a defense even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the
business, results of operation or financial position of Globus, NuVasive or the Combined Company, including through the possible diversion of either
company’s resources or distraction of key personnel.
Furthermore, one of the conditions to the completion of the Merger is the absence of an order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
enacted, promulgated, issued or entered after the date of the Merger Agreement by any governmental body enjoining, restraining, preventing or
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. As such, if any plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the consummation of the
Merger, that injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame.
The opinions of NuVasive’s and Globus’s financial advisors will not reflect changes in circumstances between the signing of the Merger Agreement
and completion of the Merger. Because NuVasive’s and Globus’s financial advisors will not be updating their opinions, the opinions will not address
the fairness of the Exchange Ratio from a financial point of view at the time the Merger is completed.
NuVasive and Globus have not obtained updated opinions from their respective financial advisors as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and do not expect to receive updated opinions prior to completion of the Merger. Changes in the operations and prospects of
NuVasive or Globus, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of NuVasive or Globus, and on which
NuVasive’s and Globus’s financial advisors’ opinions were based, may significantly alter the value of NuVasive or Globus or the prices of shares of
NuVasive Common Stock or Globus Class A Common Stock by the time the Merger is completed. The opinions do not speak as of the time the Merger will
be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinions. Because NuVasive’s and Globus’s financial advisors will not be updating their

Risks Relating to the Combined Company",54,63
NUVASIVE INC_20230328_DEFM14A_20755850_4630097.Pdf,Risks Relating to the Combined Company,"Risks Relating to the Combined Company
Combining the businesses of Globus and NuVasive may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the Combined Company may
fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, which may adversely affect the Combined Company’s business results and negatively affect the
value of the Combined Company’s common stock.
The success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, Globus’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits, synergies and efficiencies from
combining the businesses of Globus and NuVasive. This success will depend on, among other factors, Globus’s ability to successfully integrate its
business with the business of NuVasive. If Globus is not able to successfully integrate NuVasive’s business into the Combined Company within the
anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated synergies, efficiencies and other benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take
longer to realize than expected.
An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could
have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the Combined Company, which may adversely affect the value of
the common stock of the Combined Company.
Globus and NuVasive have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate independently. There can be no assurances
that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Globus or NuVasive
employees, the loss of surgeon customers, the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards,
controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration
process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The challenges involved in this integration, which will be complex and time-consuming, include the
following:
 
•
combining the businesses of Globus and NuVasive, including respective operations and corporate functions, and meeting the capital
requirements of the Combined Company in a manner that permits the Combined Company to achieve any revenue synergies or efficiencies
anticipated to result from the Merger, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Merger not being realized in the time
frame currently anticipated or at all;
 
•
integrating and retaining personnel from the two companies;
 
•
integrating each company’s technologies and technologies licensed by them from third parties;
 
•
identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;
 
•
harmonizing each company’s operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies,
procedures and processes;
 
•
maintaining existing agreements with each company’s business partners, surgeons, suppliers and vendors, avoiding delays in entering into
new agreements with prospective business partners, surgeons, suppliers and vendors, and leveraging relationships with such third parties
for the benefit of the Combined Company;
 
•
addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;
 
-31-Table of Contents
•
consolidating each company’s administrative and information technology infrastructure; coordinating sales activities and go-to-market
efforts;
 
•
coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and
 
•
effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory or other governmental approvals.
In addition, at times the attention of certain members of either company’s or both companies’ management and resources may be focused on
completion of the Merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other
opportunities that may have been beneficial to such company, which may disrupt each company’s ongoing business and the business of the Combined
Company.
The Combined Company may be unable to realize the anticipated synergies and expects to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger, which
could adversely affect the Combined Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Combined Company’s ability to achieve estimated synergies in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, is subject to various assumptions, which
may or may not prove to be accurate. As a consequence, the Combined Company may not be able to realize all of these synergies within the timeframe
expected or at all. In addition, the Combined Company may incur additional or unexpected costs in order to realize these benefits. Failure to achieve the
expected synergies could significantly reduce the expected benefits associated with the Merger.
Certain contractual counterparties may seek to modify contractual relationships with the Combined Company, which could have an adverse effect
on the Combined Company’s business and operations.
As a result of the Merger, the Combined Company may experience impacts on relationships with contractual counterparties (such as business
partners, surgeons, vendors, sales representatives, contractors or other third party service providers) that may harm the Combined Company’s business
and results of operations. Certain counterparties may seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations following the Merger whether or not contractual
rights are triggered as a result of the Merger. There can be no guarantee that Globus’s or NuVasive’s contractual counterparties will remain with or
continue to have a relationship with the Combined Company or do so on the same or similar contractual terms following the Merger. If any contractual
counterparties (such as business partners, surgeons, vendors, sales representatives, contractors or other third party service providers) seek to terminate
or modify contractual obligations or discontinue the relationship with the Combined Company, then the Combined Company’s business and results of
operations may be harmed.
Completion of the transaction may trigger change in control, assignment or other provisions in certain agreements to which NuVasive is a party,
which may have an adverse impact on the Combined Company’s business and results of operations.
The completion of the Merger may trigger change in control, assignment and other provisions in certain agreements to which NuVasive is a party. If
NuVasive is unable to negotiate waivers of or consents under those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the
agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages or other remedies. Even if NuVasive is able to negotiate waivers, the
counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to the Combined Company. Any of the
foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Combined Company,
or the ability of Globus to successfully integrate NuVasive’s business.
The Combined Company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the Combined Company’s business and
operations.
The Combined Company may be exposed to increased litigation from stockholders, customers, partners, suppliers, contractors and other third

Combined Company’s operations.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes
only and may not be reflective of the operating results and financial condition of the Combined Company following completion of the Merger.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative
purposes only, contain a variety of adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and are not necessarily indicative of what the Combined
Company’s actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the Merger been completed on the dates indicated. The Combined
Company’s actual results and financial position after the Merger may differ materially and adversely from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects
adjustments based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed. The final acquisition accounting will
be based upon the actual consideration transferred and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of NuVasive as of the date of the completion of the
Merger. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see the section titled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information.”
While presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information provided in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is based on numerous variables and assumptions (including, but not limited to, those related to industry performance and
competition, general business, the medical device industry, and economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Globus’s or
NuVasive’s business, as applicable) that are inherently subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of the respective management teams of
Globus and NuVasive. As a result, actual results may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. Important
factors that may affect actual results include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Globus’s or NuVasive’s business, as applicable
(including each company’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business and
economic conditions. See the section titled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”
Globus’s bylaws designate specific courts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by Globus stockholders, which could
limit the ability of stockholders of the Combined Company to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Combined Company.
Globus’s bylaws (which will govern the rights of NuVasive stockholders as stockholders of Globus following the Merger) provide that, unless
Globus consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on
behalf of Globus, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of Globus to Globus or
Globus stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against Globus or any director or officer or other employee of Globus arising pursuant to any
provision of the DGCL or the Globus charter or Globus bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), and (iv) any action asserting a claim against
Globus or any director or officer or other employee of Globus governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case, shall be the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware). Globus’s bylaws further
provide that unless Globus consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the
Securities Act.
This Delaware forum provision and federal forum provision in the Globus bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in
pursuing any such claims. Additionally, these forum selection clauses may
 
-33-
Table of Contents
limit Globus stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with Globus or its directors, officers or
employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against Globus and its directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful,
might benefit Globus stockholders. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates a concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits
brought concerning a duty or liability created by the securities laws, rules and regulations thereunder. While the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March
2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are “facially valid” under
Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce its federal forum provision. If the federal forum provision is found to be
unenforceable, Globus may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The federal forum provision may also impose additional
litigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the
federal district courts of the United States may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder
considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to Globus than
its stockholders.
The financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.
The financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections “The Merger—Certain NuVasive Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information” and “The Merger—Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” were based on assumptions of, and information
available to, NuVasive’s and Globus’s management when prepared and these estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainties, many of which are
beyond NuVasive’s and Globus’s control and may not be realized. Many factors mentioned in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the risks
outlined in this “Risk Factors” section and the events or circumstances described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,”
will be important in determining the Combined Company’s future results. As a result of these contingencies, actual future results may vary materially from
the estimates. In view of these uncertainties, the inclusion of financial estimates in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is not and should not be viewed
as a representation that the forecasted results will necessarily reflect actual future results.
The financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections “The Merger—Certain NuVasive Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information” and “The Merger— Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” were not prepared with a view toward public
disclosure, and such financial estimates were not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of any regulatory or professional
body. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and NuVasive and Globus do not undertake any obligation,
other than as required by applicable law, to update the financial estimates herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date those financial estimates
were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. The prospective financial information included in this
document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, NuVasive or Globus management, as applicable. No accounting firm has audited, reviewed,
examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information included under the sections
“The Merger—Certain NuVasive Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” and “The Merger—Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial

A quorum of Globus stockholders is necessary to conduct business at the Globus Special Meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock entitled to vote at the Globus Special Meeting
will constitute a quorum. Shares of Globus Common Stock represented by proxy and entitled to vote, including shares for which a Globus stockholder
directs an “abstention” from voting, will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum. However, because all of the proposals for consideration at the
Globus Special Meeting are considered “non-routine” matters, shares held in “street name” will not be counted as present for the purpose of determining
the existence of a quorum unless the Globus stockholder provides their bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the
proposals at the Globus Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, the Globus Special Meeting will be adjourned or postponed until the holders of the
number of shares of Globus Common Stock required to constitute a quorum attend. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, the Supporting Stockholders are
obligated to cause the shares of Globus Class B Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement to be counted as present at the Globus Special Meeting
for purposes of establishing a quorum. Such shares are sufficient to constitute a quorum.
Under NYSE rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” on behalf of the beneficial owner of such shares have the
authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain “routine” proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial
owners. However, banks, brokers or other nominees are not allowed under NYSE rules to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters that are
“non-routine.” This can result in a “broker non-vote,” which occurs on a proposal when (i) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to
vote on one or more “routine” proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other “non-routine” proposals
without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with voting
instructions on a “non-routine” matter. All of the proposals for consideration at the Globus Special Meeting are considered “non-routine” matters, and
banks, brokers or other nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter before the Globus Special Meeting. As a result, Globus does
not expect any broker non-votes at the Globus Special Meeting and if you hold your Globus Common Stock in “street name,” your shares will not be
represented and will not be voted on any matter unless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. It is therefore critical that you cast your vote by instructing

Globus to submit a signed proxy card, grant
a proxy electronically over the internet or by
telephone or to vote in person by ballot at
the Globus Special Meeting will not have an
effect on the outcome of the Globus
Adjournment Proposal. An abstention by
any Globus Common Stock present or
represented by proxy at the Globus Special

“AGAINST” the Globus Adjournment

As of March 17, 2023, the Globus Record Date, Globus directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote in the
aggregate 23,271,528 shares of Globus Common Stock, which represented 23% of the Globus Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Globus
Record Date, including the shares covered by the Voting Agreement described below and entered into by the Supporting Stockholders, solely in their
capacity as stockholders of Globus. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, Globus currently expects that the Supporting Stockholders will vote their shares
“FOR” the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and “FOR” the Globus Adjournment Proposal. The Globus Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement
represents approximately 70% of the total voting power of the outstanding Globus Common Stock and therefore such shares of Globus Common Stock
are sufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus Adjournment Proposal. For more information see “Interests of Globus
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For more information regarding the Voting Agreement, see the

Globus is soliciting proxies to provide an opportunity to all Globus stockholders to vote on the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus
Adjournment Proposal, whether or not such Globus stockholders are able to attend the Globus Special Meeting or any adjournment thereof. Globus will
bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from Globus stockholders. Proxies may be solicited on behalf of Globus or by Globus directors, officers and other
employees in person or by mail, telephone, facsimile, messenger, the internet or other means of communication, including electronic communication.
Globus directors, officers and employees will not be paid any additional amounts for their services or solicitation in this regard.
Globus will request that banks, brokers and other nominee record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of Globus
Common Stock and secure their voting instructions, if necessary. Globus may be required to reimburse those banks, brokers and other nominees on
request for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions.",74,74

SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and notices with respect to
two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This
process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” provides cost savings for companies.
Globus has previously adopted householding for stockholders of record. As a result, stockholders with the same address and last name may
receive only one copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus from Globus. Registered Globus stockholders (those who hold shares directly in their
name with Globus’s transfer agent) may opt out of householding and receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by
sending a written request to Globus at the address below.
Some brokers also household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless
contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding
materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer
wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of
these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.
Globus will promptly deliver a copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any Globus stockholder who only received one copy of these
materials due to householding upon request in writing to: Globus Medical, Inc., Valley Forge Business Center, 2560 General Armistead Avenue, Audubon,

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you as a Globus stockholder in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the
Globus Board for use at the Globus Special Meeting. At the Globus Special Meeting, Globus is asking Globus stockholders to consider and vote upon a
proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Globus Class A Common Stock to NuVasive stockholders in connection with the Merger for purposes of
applicable NYSE rules.
Based on the number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock outstanding as of March 3, 2023, Globus expects to issue approximately 39.3 million
shares of Globus Class A Common Stock to NuVasive stockholders in connection with the Merger. The actual number of shares of Globus Class A
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be based on the number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock outstanding at such time
and the Exchange Ratio. Based on the number of shares of Globus Common Stock and NuVasive Common Stock outstanding as of March 3, 2023, upon
completion of the Merger, the current Globus stockholders are expected to own approximately 72% of the outstanding Globus Common Stock and former
NuVasive stockholders are expected to own approximately 28% of the outstanding Globus Common Stock.
The Globus Board has carefully considered and unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger and the Share Issuance, and determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger and the Share Issuance, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Globus and its stockholders.
The Globus Board unanimously recommends that Globus stockholders vote “FOR” the Globus Share Issuance Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the Globus Special Meeting, approval of the Globus Share Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of the Globus Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Globus Special Meeting. Any shares not
present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a Globus stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other
nominee to provide voting instructions with respect to any proposals at the Globus Special Meeting to such bank, broker or other nominee) will have no
effect on the outcome of the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, provided that a quorum is otherwise present. An abstention by any shares present or
represented by proxy on the Globus Share Issuance Proposal will be counted as a vote “AGAINST” the Globus Share Issuance Proposal. In addition, if a
Globus stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for the Globus Adjournment
Proposal, but not for the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Globus Share Issuance Proposal. Broker
non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the Globus Share Issuance Proposal.

The Globus Special Meeting may be adjourned to another time and place if necessary or appropriate to permit the solicitation of additional proxies

The Globus Board unanimously recommends that Globus stockholders vote “FOR” the Globus Adjournment Proposal.
Approval of the Globus Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Globus Common
Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Globus Special Meeting. Any shares not present or represented by proxy (including due to the
failure of a Globus stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions with respect to
any proposals at the Globus Special Meeting to such bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Globus Adjournment
Proposal. An abstention by any shares present or represented by proxy on the Globus Adjournment Proposal will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Globus Adjournment Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the Globus Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Globus Special Meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the Globus Special Meeting to approve the
Globus Share Issuance Proposal, then Globus stockholders may be asked to vote on the Globus Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present or
represented by proxy, then the Globus stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the Globus Special
Meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At any subsequent
reconvening of the Globus Special Meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the manner
in which such proxies would have been voted at the original convening of the Globus Special Meeting, except for any proxies that have been validly
revoked or withdrawn prior to the subsequent meeting.

The record date to determine NuVasive stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting or any

A quorum of NuVasive stockholders is necessary to conduct business at the NuVasive Special Meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority of the shares of NuVasive Common Stock entitled to vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting will constitute a quorum. Shares of
NuVasive Common Stock present at the NuVasive Special Meeting by virtual attendance via the NuVasive Special Meeting website or represented by
proxy and entitled to vote, including shares for which a NuVasive stockholder directs an “abstention” from voting, will be counted for purposes of
determining a quorum. However, because all of the proposals for consideration at the NuVasive Special Meeting are considered “non-routine” and “non-
discretionary” matters, shares held in “street name” are not expected to be counted as present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum
unless the NuVasive stockholder provides their bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals at the NuVasive
Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, the NuVasive Special Meeting will be adjourned or postponed until the holders of the number of shares of
NuVasive Common Stock required to constitute a quorum attend. The NuVasive Special Meeting may also be adjourned to another place, if any, date or
time, even if a quorum is present.

Under Nasdaq rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” on behalf of the beneficial owner of such shares have the
authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain “routine” proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial
owners. However, banks, brokers or other nominees are not allowed under NYSE rules, which also apple to Nasdaq-listed companies, to exercise their
voting discretion with respect to matters that are “non-routine.” This can result in a “broker non-vote,” which occurs on a proposal when (i) a bank,
broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more “routine” proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not
permitted to vote on other “non-routine” proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to
provide the bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions on a “non-routine” matter. All of the proposals for consideration at the NuVasive
Special Meeting are considered “non-routine” matters, and banks, brokers or other nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter
before the NuVasive Special Meeting. As a result, NuVasive does not expect any broker non-votes at the NuVasive Special Meeting and if you hold your
shares of NuVasive Common Stock in “street name,” your shares will not be represented and will not be voted on any matter unless you affirmatively
instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee. It is therefore critical that you cast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Brokers will not be able to vote
on any of the proposals before the NuVasive Special Meeting unless they have received voting instructions from the beneficial owners.

As of March 24, 2023, the NuVasive Record Date, NuVasive directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote in the
aggregate shares of NuVasive Common Stock, which represented less than 1% of the NuVasive Common Stock issued and outstanding on the NuVasive
Record Date.
NuVasive currently expects that all NuVasive directors and NuVasive executive officers will vote their shares “FOR” the NuVasive Merger Proposal,
“FOR” the NuVasive Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the NuVasive Adjournment Proposal, although none of them has entered into any agreements
obligating them to do so.

Beneficial (Street Name) Stockholders
If your shares of NuVasive Common Stock are held through a broker (typically referred to as being held in “street name”), you will receive separate
voting instructions from your broker. You must follow the voting instructions provided by your broker in order to instruct your broker on how to vote
your shares. Stockholders who hold shares in street name should generally be able to vote by returning the voting instruction form to their broker or by
telephone or via the internet. However, the availability of telephone or internet voting will depend on the voting process of your broker. If you hold
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee and intend to vote your shares online during the NuVasive Special Meeting, you must

(c) voting during the NuVasive Special Meeting by following the instructions available on the NuVasive Special Meeting website. Attendance at the
NuVasive Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy unless you actually vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting. If you beneficially hold shares in street
name, you must contact the broker or other nominee holding your shares and follow their instructions to change your vote or revoke your proxy.
Proxy Solicitation Costs
NuVasive is soliciting proxies on behalf of NuVasive and the NuVasive Board. NuVasive will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from NuVasive
stockholders. Proxies may be solicited on behalf of NuVasive or the NuVasive Board by NuVasive directors, officers and other employees in person or by
mail, telephone, facsimile, messenger, the internet or other means of communication, including electronic communication. NuVasive directors, officers and
employees will not be paid any additional amounts for their services or solicitation in this regard.
NuVasive will request that banks, brokers and other nominee record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of NuVasive
Common Stock and secure their voting instructions, if necessary. NuVasive may be required to reimburse those banks, brokers and other nominees on
request for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions.
NuVasive has also retained Innisfree to assist in soliciting proxies and in communicating with NuVasive stockholders and estimates that it will pay
Innisfree a fee of approximately $80,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. NuVasive also has agreed to indemnify Innisfree
against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).
Householding
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and notices with respect to
two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This
process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” provides cost savings for companies. NuVasive has previously adopted householding for
NuVasive stockholders of record. As a result, NuVasive stockholders with the same address and last name may receive only one copy of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Registered NuVasive stockholders (those who hold shares of NuVasive Common Stock directly in their name with NuVasive’s
transfer agent) may opt out of householding and receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by sending a written
request to NuVasive at the address below.
Some brokers also household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple NuVasive stockholders sharing an address
unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be
householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you
no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple
copies of these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.
If you reside at the same address as another NuVasive stockholder and wish to receive a separate copy of the applicable materials, you may do so
by contacting the bank, broker or other holder of record, or NuVasive by telephone at: (858) 210-2129 or by mail to: 7475 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego,
California 92121, Attn: Investor Relations Department. Upon written or oral request, we will promptly deliver a separate copy of the notice of the NuVasive
Special Meeting and, if applicable, the proxy materials to any stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of any of these
documents.

Adjournments
If a quorum is present at the NuVasive Special Meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the NuVasive Special Meeting to approve the
NuVasive Merger Proposal, then NuVasive stockholders may be asked to vote on the NuVasive Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, the
holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, may adjourn the NuVasive Special Meeting, from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. The NuVasive Special Meeting may also be adjourned
to another place, if any, date or time, even if a quorum is present.
At any subsequent reconvening of the NuVasive Special Meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have
been transacted at the original meeting and all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the
NuVasive Special Meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened
meeting.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you as a NuVasive stockholder in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the
NuVasive Board for use at the NuVasive Special Meeting. At the NuVasive Special Meeting, NuVasive is asking NuVasive stockholders to consider and
vote upon a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into NuVasive, with NuVasive continuing as the
surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Globus. Upon completion of the Merger, each share of NuVasive Common Stock outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares of NuVasive Common Stock held in treasury or held or owned by NuVasive, Globus or
Merger Sub, will be converted into the right to receive 0.75 fully paid and non-assessable shares of Globus Class A Common Stock (subject to
adjustments in the event of any stock split or similar change to the number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock or Globus Class A Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of specified events, as specified in the Merger Agreement).
The NuVasive Board has carefully considered and unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, and determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of NuVasive and its stockholders.
Accordingly, the NuVasive Board unanimously recommends that NuVasive stockholders vote “FOR” the NuVasive Merger Proposal.
The Merger and a summary of the terms of the Merger Agreement are described in more detail under “The Merger” and “The Merger Agreement,”
and NuVasive stockholders are encouraged to read the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A hereto.
Assuming a quorum is present at the NuVasive Special Meeting, approval of the NuVasive Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of NuVasive Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at the close of business on the NuVasive Record Date. If a
NuVasive stockholder fails to vote, fails to instruct its bank, broker or nominee to vote with respect to the NuVasive Merger Proposal or abstains from
voting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the NuVasive Merger Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the NuVasive Merger Proposal.
It is a condition to the completion of the Merger that NuVasive stockholders approve the NuVasive Merger Proposal.

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, NuVasive is required to provide its stockholders
the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to NuVasive’s named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as described in the section titled “Interests of NuVasive Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to NuVasive’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger—
Golden Parachute Compensation,” including the footnotes to the table. Accordingly, NuVasive stockholders are being provided the opportunity to cast
an advisory vote on such payments.
The NuVasive Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, and is asking NuVasive stockholders to vote “FOR” the adoption of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the NuVasive stockholders hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to NuVasive’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K
in the in the table in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “Interests of NuVasive Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to NuVasive’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger—Golden Parachute
Compensation,” including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative disclosures.”
The NuVasive Board unanimously recommends that NuVasive stockholders vote “FOR” the NuVasive Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the NuVasive Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the NuVasive Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you
may vote to approve the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa.
Because the vote on the NuVasive Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either NuVasive or Globus. Accordingly, if the
Merger Agreement is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,
regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of NuVasive stockholders.
Assuming a quorum is present at the NuVasive Special Meeting, approval of the NuVasive Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of NuVasive Common Stock present, including by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to
vote thereon. Any shares not present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a NuVasive stockholder who holds shares in “street name”
through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions with respect to any proposals at the NuVasive Special Meeting to such bank,
broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the NuVasive Compensation Proposal, provided that a quorum is otherwise present. An
abstention by any shares present or represented by proxy to vote on the NuVasive Compensation Proposal will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the NuVasive Compensation Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the NuVasive Compensation Proposal.

NuVasive Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) to solicit additional proxies will be made solely by NuVasive.
NuVasive is asking NuVasive stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the NuVasive Board to vote in favor of any adjournment
of the NuVasive Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the NuVasive Merger

The NuVasive Board regularly evaluates NuVasive’s strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view towards strengthening NuVasive’s
business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the NuVasive Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic
alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, NuVasive’s current business plan with NuVasive
remaining an independent entity; (2) capital allocation initiatives; (3) potential expansion opportunities through acquisitions, partnerships or other
commercial relationships; and (4) business combinations and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of some or all of NuVasive.
Globus management and the Globus Board regularly evaluate the strategic opportunities available to Globus with a view towards strengthening
Globus’s business, performance, industry positioning and prospects and enhancing stockholder value. As part of its ongoing evaluation, Globus has
evaluated and considered from time to time various potential strategic transactions, including potential mergers with or acquisitions of other participants
in the medical device industry. In January of 2021, the Globus Board contacted Goldman Sachs to evaluate potential acquisition targets in the medical
device industry.
As active participants in the spine and orthopedics industry, NuVasive and Globus are well known to each other. From time to time, members of
NuVasive management have met with members of Globus management to discuss their industry and their respective businesses. At various points in the
past, NuVasive and Globus discussed consolidation in their industry and the potential for a business combination transaction between NuVasive and
Globus. These discussions were general in nature and did not advance beyond preliminary, exploratory conversations.
On September 24, 2021, at the request of Mr. David C. Paul, Executive Chairman of Globus, an in-person meeting was held to discuss the possibility
of a business combination between NuVasive and Globus. Present at that meeting were Mr. Paul, Dave Demski, who was then the Chief Executive Officer
of Globus, Daniel Wolterman, Chairman of the NuVasive Board, and Christopher Barry, the Chief Executive Officer of NuVasive.
 
-57-Table of Contents
On October 1, 2021, the Globus Board held a meeting to discuss the opportunity with NuVasive, including the strategic rationale for the
combination, the relevant financial analysis, and the potential terms of a non-binding letter of intent.
On October 8, 2021, Globus sent a non-binding letter of intent (the “October 2021 Letter”), which proposed to combine NuVasive and Globus in an-
all stock transaction. Among other terms, the October 2021 Letter offered consideration of 0.90 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock for each share of
NuVasive Common Stock. On October 8, 2021, the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock was $58.03 and the closing price of Globus Class A Common
Stock was $76.07, reflecting an implied premium for NuVasive Common Stock of 18%.
Following receipt of the October 2021 Letter, NuVasive contacted BofA Securities and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”) to
discuss and assess the risks and merits of the transaction proposed by the October 2021 Letter. BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton had previously
provided advisory services to NuVasive with respect to potential strategic transactions.
Shortly after NuVasive’s receipt of the October 2021 Letter, Wachtell Lipton provided a draft mutual confidentiality agreement to facilitate
discussions and the disclosure of information between NuVasive and Globus, and following negotiations and certain revisions thereof, NuVasive and
Globus entered into the mutual confidentiality agreement on October 22, 2021. The confidentiality agreement did not contain a standstill restriction on
Globus. At that time, and thereafter during the course of discussions between Globus and NuVasive until they entered into the Merger Agreement, no
third parties were subject to a standstill with NuVasive restricting them from making an acquisition proposal to NuVasive.
On November 1, 2021, the NuVasive Board held its regularly-scheduled quarterly meeting. The agenda for the November meeting included a session
focused on the industry and competitive landscape, a strategy review and a discussion of NuVasive’s long-range business plan, and was updated to
include consideration of the October 2021 Letter. At the meeting, representatives from BofA Securities presented an overview of various strategic
alternatives and considerations for NuVasive, including with respect to the potential transaction with Globus contemplated by the October 2021 Letter. In
addition, representatives from Wachtell Lipton discussed the directors’ fiduciary duties in the context of considering the potential transaction with
Globus and various considerations that should be included in the NuVasive Board’s decision-making process. The NuVasive Board discussed NuVasive’s
standalone strategy, as well as the potential risks and merits of a transaction with Globus and the potential value creation for NuVasive stockholders from
such a transaction relative to NuVasive’s long-range business plan. Following discussion, the NuVasive Board directed management to request a meeting
between representatives of Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to Globus, and BofA Securities, financial advisor to NuVasive, to engage in discussions
regarding potential risks and opportunities for a potential transaction.
On or about November 15, 2021, there were reports in the media that NuVasive and Globus were considering a potential transaction. These reports
led to stock price volatility, as well as disruption impacting the companies’ respective employees and other stakeholders. Given the very early stages of
discussions between the parties, and the fact that no diligence information had yet been shared, Globus and NuVasive agreed on November 16, 2021 that
engaging in more substantive interactions would lead to further unwanted disruption at that time. Therefore, the parties decided to cease further
discussions with respect to a potential transaction and to pursue their standalone strategies instead.
From the end of November 2021 through early October 2022, there were occasional communications between the parties, including communications
about industry trends and developments, as well as industry consolidation, but no substantive discussions regarding a possible strategic transaction.
On April 21, 2022, Mr. Demski resigned as Chief Executive Officer of Globus, and Mr. Daniel Scavilla was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of
Globus.

On October 19, 2022, Mr. Paul called Mr. Wolterman to inquire if NuVasive would be open to receiving an indication of interest for a potential
transaction with Globus. Mr. Wolterman responded to Mr. Paul that NuVasive would give due consideration to an indication of interest.
On November 1, 2022, the Globus Board held a meeting with members of Globus management in attendance to discuss the opportunity with
NuVasive including the strategic rationale, financial analysis, and terms of a non-binding letter of intent. The Globus Board recommended that Globus
provide NuVasive with a non-binding letter of intent reflecting the same terms as those in the October 2021 Letter, other than decreasing the exchange
ratio based on the current relative value of NuVasive Common Stock to Globus Class A Common stock.
On November 1, 2022, Mr. Paul sent Mr. Wolterman a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest (the “November 1 Letter”) setting forth certain
terms under which Globus proposed to acquire NuVasive. The November 1 Letter offered consideration of 0.80 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock
for each share of NuVasive Common Stock. On November 1, 2022, the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock was $44.71 and the closing price of
Globus Class A Common Stock was $66.92, reflecting an implied premium for NuVasive Common Stock of 20%. The November 1 Letter also provided for
the expansion of the Globus Board to include up to 4 members of the NuVasive Board, a 60-day exclusivity period for negotiations between NuVasive and
Globus and a $120 million termination fee that would be payable by NuVasive in the event the parties entered into a definitive agreement and NuVasive
subsequently decided not to consummate the transaction.
On November 2, 2022, the NuVasive Board held its regularly-scheduled quarterly meeting. The agenda for the meeting included a session focused
on the industry and competitive landscape, a strategy review and a discussion of NuVasive’s long-range business plan, and was updated to include
consideration of the November 1 Letter. Mr. Wolterman provided an overview of his communications with Mr. Paul, and members of management
provided their perspective on the merits and risks of engaging in further discussions with Globus. Following discussion, the NuVasive Board directed
management to engage with Globus to assess the potential opportunity afforded by a transaction, but to reject Globus’s request for exclusivity (and, at
no point prior to the signing of the merger agreement did NuVasive agree to such exclusivity). Thereafter, on November 3, 2022, Messrs. Wolterman, Paul,
Barry and Scavilla engaged in communications about a potential transaction, and Messrs. Wolterman and Barry provided feedback from the NuVasive
Board on the November 1 Letter to Messrs. Paul and Scavilla.
During the course of the negotiations with Globus following NuVasive’s receipt of the November 1 Letter, members of NuVasive management
provided updates via email to the NuVasive Board regarding the terms proposed by Globus as well as ongoing communications between the parties.
During the period between November 1, 2022 and November 15, 2022, the gap between the stock price of Globus Class A Common Stock and the
stock price of NuVasive Common Stock generally continued to increase. The closing price of Globus Class A Common Stock increased approximately
7.3% during such period, whereas the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock decreased by approximately 16.6% in the same period.
On November 14, 2022, Messrs. Wolterman and Paul discussed various matters pertaining to Globus’s intent to submit a revised indication of
interest.
On the morning of November 16, 2022, Mr. Paul sent a revised preliminary, non-binding indication of interest dated November 15, 2022 (the
“November 15 Letter”) to Mr. Wolterman, which proposed an exchange ratio of 0.72 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock for each share of NuVasive
Common Stock. On November 16, 2022, the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock was $36.42 and the closing price of Globus Class A Common Stock
was $70.40, reflecting an implied premium for NuVasive Common Stock of 39%. The November 15 Letter also provided for the expansion of the Globus
Board to include up to 2 members of the NuVasive Board, and a 60-day exclusivity period for negotiations between NuVasive and Globus. The
 
-59-
Table of Contents
November 15 Letter also proposed that if the parties executed a definitive agreement and a party subsequently decided not to consummate the
transaction, the terminating party would pay the other party a termination fee of $120 million. Thereafter, on November 16, 2022, Mr. Paul called Mr.
Wolterman to discuss the terms of this revised proposal. Among other things, Mr. Paul indicated that the recent stock price decline of NuVasive Common
Stock and the stock price increase of Globus Class A Common Stock had impacted Globus’s perspective on the exchange ratio.
On November 18, 2022, Mr. Wolterman indicated to Mr. Paul that, in light of the macro-economic environment and continued stock price volatility,
NuVasive would be pausing discussions to focus on other initiatives that were underway but that he was open to reconnecting later with Mr. Paul.
On November 28, 2022, Messrs. Wolterman and Barry met in person with Messrs. Paul and Scavilla. At that meeting, the parties discussed the
merits of a merger between NuVasive and Globus, including potential synergies that could be achieved from the merger. Messrs. Wolterman and Barry
also indicated to Messrs. Paul and Scavilla that the exchange ratio proposed in the November 15 Letter undervalued NuVasive and was thus not
acceptable to NuVasive.
Thereafter, on December 2, 2022, Messrs. Wolterman and Paul engaged in further discussions regarding the relative stock prices of NuVasive and
Globus and the exchange ratio for the potential merger, as well as the possibility that Globus would submit a revised indication of interest.
On December 5, 2022, the NuVasive Board met with members of NuVasive management regarding various strategic initiatives underway, and Mr.
Wolterman noted that Globus and NuVasive were continuing to discuss the possibility of a merger. At the meeting, the NuVasive Board authorized
management to direct BofA Securities to engage in valuation discussions with Globus’s financial advisor.
Thereafter, representatives of BofA Securities had calls with representatives of Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to Globus, in which they
discussed, among other things, the exchange ratio for the potential merger.
On December 8, 2022, the Globus Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Globus management in attendance, at which it
discussed the status of the negotiations for the potential merger with NuVasive and the terms of the November 15 Letter. Following such discussion, the
Globus Board recommended to increase the proposed exchange ratio to 0.75 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock for each share of NuVasive
Common Stock.
On December 16, 2022, Mr. Paul sent a further revised preliminary, non-binding indication of interest (the “December 16 Letter”) to Mr. Wolterman.
The December 16 Letter offered a revised exchange ratio of 0.75 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock for each share of NuVasive Common Stock, but
otherwise proposed substantially the same terms for a transaction as the November 15 Letter. On December 16, 2022, the closing price of NuVasive
Common Stock was $40.38 and the closing price of Globus Class A Common Stock was $71.63, reflecting an implied premium for NuVasive Common Stock
of 33%.
On December 17, 2022, the NuVasive Board met with members of NuVasive management and representatives of BofA Securities. Representatives of
BofA Securities reviewed with the NuVasive Board BofA Securities’s preliminary financial analysis of the exchange ratio proposed to be received by
NuVasive stockholders in the merger, and members of NuVasive management provided the NuVasive Board with their initial views of possible synergies
from a combination of NuVasive and Globus. In addition, the NuVasive Board considered risks and opportunities relating to NuVasive’s strategic plan,
including the expected value creation opportunity from continued execution of NuVasive’s standalone strategy. The NuVasive Board also discussed
various considerations involved in soliciting indications of interest from other third parties for a potential transaction with NuVasive, including whether a
higher value could be obtained for NuVasive stockholders from a third party and whether increased competition could result in more attractive pricing or
other terms for
 
-60-
Table of Contents
NuVasive from Globus, as well as potential risks and disruption that could occur from exploratory outreaches and potential market rumors that may result,
and a potential adverse reaction from Globus that could negatively impact its willingness to continue pursuing a transaction with NuVasive. Following
discussions with NuVasive management and representatives of BofA Securities, the NuVasive Board was of the view that there was unlikely to be a third
party who would be able or willing to provide greater value for NuVasive stockholders as compared to the exchange ratio proposed by Globus in the
December 16 Letter, and accordingly authorized NuVasive management to continue exploratory discussions with Globus, to work with BofA Securities
and Wachtell Lipton and to concurrently commence a mutual diligence process.
Also in conjunction with the December 17, 2022 meeting of the NuVasive Board, the NuVasive Board was provided with certain information from
BofA Securities regarding any material relationships between BofA Securities and Globus during the preceding two-year period as well as information
regarding certain bond hedge and warrant arrangements that certain BofA Securities affiliates, acting as principals for their own accounts, had entered
into with NuVasive in connection with NuVasive’s 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2023 (collectively, the Call Spread Transactions, as defined and
described further in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The Merger — Opinion of NuVasive’s Financial Advisor — Call Spread
Transactions”). Given that the conversion price for the convertible notes was well in excess of the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock on December
16, 2022, NuVasive management was of the view that the conversion right was unlikely to be exercised by noteholders and, accordingly, BofA Securities’
potential obligations pursuant to the hedging arrangements were immaterial.
On December 19, 2022, Mr. Wolterman called Mr. Paul to indicate NuVasive’s desire to move forward with mutual diligence and that NuVasive was
prepared to accept the exchange ratio proposed in the December 16 Letter but that the proposed termination fees and request for exclusivity were not
acceptable to NuVasive and that NuVasive desired a number of directors on the board of the combined company that would be proportionate to the
ownership percentage of NuVasive stockholders in the combined company.
On December 21, 2022, the Globus Board held a meeting to discuss Mr. Paul’s December 19th call with Mr. Wolterman, the terms of the December 16
Letter, including the amount of the termination fee and the number of NuVasive Board members that could be appointed to serve on the Globus Board
post-merger. Following such discussion, the Globus Board authorized Globus management to propose to NuVasive that Globus was willing to add an
additional NuVasive director to the Globus Board following the merger (for a total of up to three NuVasive directors) and recommended that Mr. Paul
reiterate Globus’s desire for a $120 million mutual termination fee if the merger agreement between the parties was terminated under certain circumstances.
On December 21, 2022, Mr. Paul stated in a call with Mr. Wolterman that Globus was willing to expand the Globus Board to eleven directors in order
to allow three NuVasive directors to join the Globus Board at the closing of the proposed transaction, but reiterated Globus’s view that the proposed
transaction should have a mutual termination fee of $120 million.
On December 22 and December 23, 2022, Messrs. Barry and Scavilla held calls in which they discussed, among other things, the need for speed and
certainty of closing in the event that NuVasive and Globus agreed to move forward with a transaction.
On December 23, 2022, representatives of BofA Securities and Goldman Sachs had a call to discuss the proposed transaction, including the timeline
and diligence process. Following the call, representatives of Goldman Sachs sent an initial diligence request list from Globus to representatives of BofA
Securities.
Between December 23, 2022 and January 1, 2023, there were several calls between NuVasive management and Globus management to discuss
diligence matters, including with respect to an assessment of potential synergies and risks for a combined company. During this period, Messrs.
Wolterman, Paul, Barry and Scavilla continued to engage in communications regarding transaction terms, including Globus’s request for exclusivity
(which Messrs. Wolterman and Barry continued to reject), as well as termination rights and termination fees.

On December 29, 2022, certain members of NuVasive management, including Mr. Barry, held an in-person meeting with certain members of Globus
management to discuss, among other things, the complementarity of NuVasive’s and Globus’s commercial sales.

approvals, an end date (at which either party could unilaterally terminate the merger agreement) of six months after the merger agreement was signed,
non- solicitation restrictions prohibiting NuVasive from soliciting or engaging in discussions with competing bidders, and a termination fee of $120 million
that was payable by NuVasive under certain circumstances, including if NuVasive terminated the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal. The
draft agreement also provided that the NuVasive Board could only change its recommendation to be adverse to a transaction with Globus in the event
that NuVasive received a superior proposal.

materials provided by the other party and engaged in business and legal due diligence discussions with representatives and advisors of the other party,
and submitted a number of requests for additional due diligence information. The mutual diligence focused on, among other things, complementarity of
the parties’ commercial sales, assessing potential synergies and risks for the combined company, legal and compliance matters, human resources matters,
finance and accounting matters, and long range business plans.
On January 5, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton had a call with representatives of Troutman to discuss the terms of the draft merger
agreement, including with respect to a voting commitment to be provided by Mr. Paul, Globus’s regulatory efforts commitment, the non-solicitation
restrictions on NuVasive and termination fees proposed by Globus. Also on January 5, 2023, representatives of BofA Securities had a call with
representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss certain of these matters.

in certain termination scenarios, contained a go-shop provision permitting NuVasive to solicit competing bids for a period of 45 days following the
signing of the merger agreement (the “go-shop period”) and pay a reduced termination fee of 1% of transaction equity value to Globus if NuVasive
terminated the agreement in response to a superior proposal from a bidder that emerged during the go-shop period, proposed a termination

fee that would be payable by Globus in certain termination scenarios, and permitted the NuVasive Board to change its recommendation for the transaction
in response to certain unforeseen material intervening events.

NuVasive. The Globus Board reviewed and noted such disclosures, and determined that they were not material.
On January 9, 2023, representatives of Goldman Sachs shared with representatives of BofA Securities certain preliminary prospective financial
information prepared by Globus management relating to Globus’s five year business plan (the “Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections”). For more
information, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The Merger — Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information”.
Also on January 9, 2023, Messrs. Wolterman and Paul held a call to discuss certain matters relating to the transaction, including the progress being
made by the parties in their diligence and negotiation of definitive documents.
On January 10, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent a draft of the voting agreement to Troutman, which, among other things, required Mr.
Paul and certain of his affiliates to vote in favor of the transaction at the Globus Special Meeting.
On January 11, 2023, representatives of BofA Securities shared certain preliminary prospective financial information prepared by NuVasive
management relating to NuVasive’s five year business plan with representatives of Goldman Sachs (the “NuVasive Standalone Projections”). The

ordinary course and reviewed by the NuVasive Board at its November 2, 2022 meeting. For more information, see the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus titled “The Merger Proposal — Certain NuVasive Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”.
On January 14, 2023, representatives of Troutman sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. In the revised
draft, Globus (i) indicated that Mr. Paul was not willing to sign a voting agreement, (ii) rejected the go-shop provision and the requirement for Globus to
pay a termination fee in certain termination scenarios, (iii) reverted to a break-fee of $120 million payable by NuVasive in certain termination scenarios and
a payment of up to $5 million if the termination was due to the failure of the merger to be approved by the NuVasive stockholders, (iv) provided that
Globus was not required to agree to any remedies to obtain any required regulatory approvals, (v) proposed an end date that was six months after signing
(with one three-month extension), and (vi) removed the ability of the NuVasive Board to change its recommendation to NuVasive stockholders in

-63-
Table of Contents
provided the NuVasive Board with an update on the status of the merger agreement negotiations and an overview of the mutual diligence process being
conducted by the parties. In addition, NuVasive management reviewed with the NuVasive Board certain terms proposed by BofA Securities for its
engagement as NuVasive’s financial advisor in connection with the potential merger, as well as the disclosure letter that BofA Securities had previously
provided in December 2022 for the NuVasive Board’s review. Following discussion, the NuVasive Board concluded that there were no material conflicts
that would preclude BofA Securities from continuing to advise NuVasive with respect to the potential transaction with Globus, and authorized NuVasive
management to negotiate and enter into an engagement letter with BofA Securities.
On January 17 and 18, 2023, there were multiple calls between NuVasive management and Globus management, with representatives of BofA
Securities and Goldman Sachs in attendance for some of these calls, to facilitate NuVasive’s due diligence review of Globus. On January 18, 2023,
representatives of BofA Securities had a call with representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss certain terms of the proposed transaction.
On January 18, 2023, Mr. Barry had an in-person meeting with Messrs. Paul and Scavilla in which they engaged in further discussions regarding
certain transaction terms. In particular, they reached an agreement in principle on Globus’s regulatory efforts commitment and for NuVasive to have the
benefit of a “window-shop” provision, pursuant to which NuVasive would pay a reduced termination fee to Globus if it terminated the merger agreement
in response to a superior proposal from a competing bidder that emerged within a specified “window-shop” period after signing. They agreed that Mr.
Paul would revert on the voting commitment after a discussion with the Globus Board.
On January 18, 2023, Mr. Paul updated the Globus Board via email as to the status of negotiations with NuVasive management, including with
respect to provisions in the merger agreement concerning a proposed end date of eight months after signing (with the possibility of two two-month
extensions if necessary to obtain regulatory approval), the proposed “window-shop” period, whether to decrease the proposed termination fees, the
interim operating covenants and Mr. Paul’s voting agreement with respect to the Share Issuance.

representatives from Wachtell Lipton discussed the directors’ fiduciary duties in the context of considering the potential transaction with Globus and
various considerations that should be included in the NuVasive Board’s decision-making process, and also discussed required regulatory approvals and
various other aspects of the potential transaction. At this meeting and in other meetings throughout the NuVasive Board’s consideration of the potential
transaction with Globus, the NuVasive Board met in executive session with only non-employee directors in attendance.
On January 19, 2023, Mr. Barry and other members of NuVasive management held additional in-person meetings with members of Globus
management. The meetings focused on certain remaining diligence matters as well as communications planning efforts.

extensions if necessary to obtain regulatory approval), a requirement for Globus to agree to remedies to obtain the required regulatory approvals (subject
to a cap), a break-fee payable by NuVasive equal to 3% of transaction equity value in certain termination scenarios, no termination fee payable by
NuVasive in the event that NuVasive
 
-64-

stockholders failed to approve the merger, and a termination fee payable by Globus if the merger agreement was terminated due to failure to obtain
required regulatory approvals.
On January 19, 2023, the NuVasive Board met with members of NuVasive management and representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton
in attendance. At the meeting, members of NuVasive management updated the NuVasive Board regarding ongoing negotiations with Globus, NuVasive’s
diligence efforts and findings, potential synergies, opportunities and risks from the transaction, and Globus’s long-range business plan and financial
profile, including the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections.
On January 21, 2023, a representative of Troutman sent representatives of Wachtell Lipton an email (the “January 21 Email”) outlining Globus’s
position on certain terms that were still under negotiation between the parties. The response indicated that Mr. Paul was amenable to signing a voting
agreement that would require him to vote his shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Globus Board as of the time of the Globus Special
Meeting. In addition, Globus indicated that NuVasive’s proposed construct of an outside date of eight months with the possibility of two two-month
extensions was acceptable, but rejected any obligation for Globus to pay NuVasive a regulatory termination fee in the event that the merger agreement
was terminated as a result of the failure to obtain regulatory approval, as well as certain terms of the regulatory efforts commitment that NuVasive was
seeking from Globus. The January 21 Email also proposed certain limitations on the parties’ ability to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a
superior proposal. Thereafter, representatives of BofA Securities had a call with representatives of Goldman Sachs and on January 22, 2023, Messrs.
Wolterman and Barry held a call with Messrs. Paul and Scavilla to discuss the terms outlined in the January 21 Email.
On January 22, 2023, the NuVasive Board met, with members of NuVasive management and representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton
in attendance. The NuVasive Board discussed various transaction terms with NuVasive’s management and representatives of BofA Securities and
Wachtell Lipton, including terms relating to NuVasive’s ability to accept a superior proposal, the window-shop provision and reduced termination fee
payable if NuVasive pursues a superior transaction with a qualifying bidder, termination fees payable in certain termination scenarios, regulatory matters
and the voting commitment from Mr. Paul. The NuVasive Board directed NuVasive management to continue to negotiate with Globus with a view to
reaching acceptable positions consistent with those discussed at the meeting.
On January 23 and 24, 2023, in separate calls, Messrs. Wolterman and Paul and representatives of BofA Securities and Goldman Sachs engaged in
further discussion regarding transaction terms. In his conversation with Mr. Paul, Mr. Wolterman sought certain clarifications and modifications to
expand NuVasive’s “fiduciary out” rights to terminate the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal, reduce the termination fees proposed by
Globus, strengthen the regulatory commitment from Globus and enhance the voting commitment from Mr. Paul.
On January 25, 2023, Mr. Paul sent Mr. Wolterman an email outlining certain details about the voting commitment he was willing to provide, the
termination fees payable by NuVasive and Globus under various termination scenarios and potential options with respect to Globus’s regulatory
commitment. He also indicated Globus’s willingness to accept NuVasive’s proposal regarding the window-shop provision and expanded “fiduciary out”
right for NuVasive was conditioned on Globus also having reciprocal window-shop and “fiduciary out” provisions. On January 25, 2023, Messrs.
Wolterman and Paul also had a call to discuss these and other matters related to the proposed transaction.
On January 26, 2023, NuVasive executed an engagement letter pursuant to which it formally retained BofA Securities as its financial advisor in
connection with a potential transaction with Globus.

combination
 
-65-
Table of Contents
between the two companies based on, among other factors, the NuVasive Projections and the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections. Representatives
of BofA Securities also presented to the NuVasive Board an updated version of its preliminary financial analysis of the proposed exchange ratio to be
received by the NuVasive stockholders. At the meeting, the NuVasive Board discussed with NuVasive management and representatives of BofA
Securities whether the limited number of potential strategic partners were likely to be interested in a strategic transaction with NuVasive, as well as
challenges facing financial sponsors in obtaining attractive financing in the current market environment and the lack of potential synergies with
alternative partners as compared to the combination of NuVasive with Globus. In addition, the NuVasive Board also received an update on the status of
the negotiations with Globus with respect to certain transaction terms, including terms relating to the voting agreement from Mr. Paul, the window-shop
provision and termination fees, and the regulatory commitment from Globus. The NuVasive Board provided guidance to NuVasive management and
directed management to continue negotiations with Globus. Additionally, the NuVasive Board considered certain updated disclosures regarding BofA
Securities’ prior disclosure letter, which the NuVasive Board determined were not material.
On January 26, 2023, the Globus Board met to discuss the status of the negotiations with NuVasive, including provisions in the proposed merger
agreement concerning the terms of the regulatory efforts commitment from Globus, the potential mutuality of the window shop provision, the proposed
termination fee in connection with either company’s stockholders not approving the transaction, and Mr. Paul’s voting agreement. The Globus Board
discussed various proposals regarding its obligations with respect to obtaining regulatory approval, including whether Globus would be required to make
any divestitures.
On January 27, 2023, Mr. Wolterman had a call with Mr. Paul in which they discussed the voting agreement, the window-shop provision, the
quantum of the termination fees and the terms of the regulatory commitment. Mr. Paul indicated on the call that final agreement on these matters was
subject to the views of the Globus Board.
Mr. Paul called Mr. Wolterman and indicated that he was willing to agree to a stronger voting commitment, pursuant to which Mr. Paul would only
be relieved of his commitment to vote in favor of the transaction in the event that Globus received an alternative acquisition proposal that the Globus
Board determined to be superior to the merger with NuVasive, and that Globus was willing to strengthen its regulatory commitment, but that it was
unwilling to agree to NuVasive’s proposed reduction of the termination fees and the scenarios under which such fees would become payable. Mr.
Wolterman communicated this update to the NuVasive Board via email.
Subsequently, on January 27, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Troutman
and Goodwin.
On January 30, 2023, members of management of NuVasive held calls with members of management of Globus to discuss, among other things, the
operating restrictions on NuVasive in the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the transaction. Also on January 30,
2023, representatives of Goodwin sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton.
On January 31, 2023, Globus executed an engagement letter, dated January 30, 2023, pursuant to which it formally retained Goldman Sachs as its
exclusive financial advisor in connection with a potential acquisition of NuVasive.
On January 31, 2023, members of management of NuVasive and representatives of Wachtell Lipton had calls with members of management of
Globus and representatives of Goodwin to discuss certain outstanding terms, including those relating to non-solicitation restrictions, the ability of the
NuVasive Board to change its recommendation in response to a material intervening event (in addition to its right to change its recommendation in
connection with a superior proposal), termination rights, quantum of the termination fees and the regulatory efforts covenant as well as certain employee
matters. Following those discussions, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Goodwin.

On February 2, 2023, members of management of NuVasive and representatives of Wachtell Lipton held a call with members of management of
Globus and representatives of Goodwin to discuss certain outstanding legal points and on February 3, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent a

Lipton.
On February 5, 2023, representatives of Goldman Sachs shared with representatives of BofA Securities certain revised prospective financial
information prepared by Globus management relating to Globus’s five year business plan (the “Globus Standalone Projections”). For more information,
see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The Merger— Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”. The
Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections were revised by Globus management to reflect an increase to Globus’s projected revenue and profitability
based on assumptions that Globus management determined to be more realistic for Globus’s business and prospects, and in order to more closely align
with Globus management’s long-term expectation for Globus as the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections were based on a base case set of
assumptions. The increase in profitability reflected in the Globus Standalone Projections was primarily driven by the volume impact of higher projected
sales, as well as greater fixed cost leverage, as compared to the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections.
On February 5, 2023, the NuVasive Board met with members of NuVasive management with representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton

due primarily to revised assumptions related to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

At a special meeting held on February 8, 2023, the NuVasive Board unanimously: (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of NuVasive and its stockholders; (2)
approved, adopted, deemed and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the performance by NuVasive of its covenants and agreements contained
therein and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (3) directed that the approval of the
Merger and adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of NuVasive stockholders; and (4) resolved to recommend that
NuVasive stockholders approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, the NuVasive Board unanimously recommends that NuVasive
stockholders vote “FOR” the NuVasive Merger Proposal.
In evaluating the proposed transaction, reaching its determinations and making its recommendations, the NuVasive Board consulted with NuVasive
senior management and its outside legal and financial advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following factors that weighed in favor
of the transaction:
Strategic Considerations and Synergies
 
•
Complementary global scale and expanded commercial reach. The transaction is expected to substantially accelerate NuVasive’s
globalization strategy to target the $50 billion musculoskeletal market. Together, Globus and NuVasive have a presence in more than 50
countries with more than 5,000 employees. The Combined Company’s larger commercial sales organization would enable it to further
penetrate existing and future markets and reach more surgeons and patients around the world;
 
•
Comprehensive and innovative portfolio in spine and orthopedics. The transaction would pair Globus’s and NuVasive’s complementary
spine and orthopedic solutions and enabling technologies to create a more comprehensive and innovative product offering for surgeons
and patients;
 
•
Continued commitment to product development and surgeon education. Globus and NuVasive both have strong track records of
developing technology that targets unmet clinical needs for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. The Combined Company is
expected to continue to prioritize collaboration with healthcare professionals to develop ground-breaking products and solutions to address
the full continuum of care, from planning to execution to postoperative data;
 
•
Expanded operational capabilities. The Combined Company could leverage expanded operational capabilities to further unlock
manufacturing capacity and asset utilization to support the Combined Company’s commercial organization. Together, Globus and NuVasive
would benefit from their
 
-73-Table of Contents
respective operational advantages—including Globus’s in-house manufacturing capacity and NuVasive’s global distribution networks,
which includes NuVasive’s Memphis-based global distribution center;
 
•
Compelling upside revenue potential. The Globus and NuVasive product, customer, and geographic footprints are highly complementary,
thereby creating strong growth opportunities for the Combined Company over the long-term;
 
•
Financial Scale. The Combined Company would have the scale, balance sheet strength, financial flexibility, and free cash flow to fund
future growth, and improved ability to access the capital markets on more favorable terms, which would allow the Combined Company to be
more competitive in capturing strategic opportunities;
 
•
Value creation opportunity. The Combined Company would have a strong track record of delivering above-market net sales growth through
its innovation and commercial channels, positioning it to deliver a mid-30% EBITDA profile over the next three years, taking into account
approximately $170 million in identified estimated cost synergies;
Attractive Value of Consideration
 
•
the aggregate value and nature of the consideration to be received in the Merger by NuVasive stockholders, including:
 
•
that the merger consideration represented a premium of approximately 24.5% to NuVasive stockholders based on the closing price of
NuVasive Common Stock on February 7, 2023, the last day before the signing of the Merger Agreement, and a premium of approximately
42.9% based on the 90-day volume weighted average share price of NuVasive Common Stock as of the same date;
 
•
that the merger consideration consists of Globus Class A Common Stock, which offers NuVasive stockholders the opportunity to participate
in the future earnings, dividends, if any, and growth of the Combined Company, which the NuVasive Board considers to be an attractive
investment for the reasons discussed above in this section under “— Strategic Considerations and Synergies”;
 
•
the fact that NuVasive stockholders will own approximately 28% of the Combined Company;
 
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement provides for a fixed Exchange Ratio and that no adjustment will be made to the merger consideration to
be received by NuVasive stockholders in the Merger as a result of possible changes in the market price of Globus Class A Common Stock
following the announcement of the Merger;
 
•
that the Merger is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, as more fully described in the
section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”;
Most Attractive Strategic Alternative
 
•
the view of the NuVasive Board that the proposed transaction with Globus was the most attractive strategic alternative available to
NuVasive and its stockholders, including in comparison to the alternative of remaining independent and continuing to execute on
NuVasive’s long-term business strategy. In this regard, the NuVasive Board considered:
 
•
that the limited number of potential strategic partners were unlikely to be interested in a strategic transaction with NuVasive;
 
•
the challenges facing financial sponsors in obtaining attractive financing in the current market environment, as well as the lack of potential
synergies as compared to the combination of NuVasive with Globus;
 
-74-
Table of Contents
•
the risks involved in soliciting alternative acquisition proposals, including with respect to potential market rumors, as well as disruption and
other adverse impacts on NuVasive’s commercial relationships with various stakeholders;
 
•
its belief, based on positions taken by Globus during negotiations and the premium relative to the standalone price of NuVasive Common
Stock, that the Exchange Ratio was the maximum consideration that Globus would be willing to offer;
 
•
its belief that entering into the Merger Agreement with Globus provided the best alternative for maximizing stockholder value reasonably
available to NuVasive and its stockholders, including when compared to continuing to operate on a standalone basis and taking into
account certain risks associated with continuing to operate as a standalone company, including the risk factors set forth in the section titled
“Risk Factors” in NuVasive’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which is incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and other documents that are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus;
 
•
that NuVasive stockholders would have the opportunity to participate in the long-term value-creation potential of Globus after giving effect
to the Merger;
Opinion of NuVasive’s Financial Advisor
 
•
the opinion of BofA Securities, dated February 8, 2023, to the NuVasive Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the
date of the opinion, of the Exchange Ratio to the holders of NuVasive Common Stock, as more fully described below in the section titled “ —
Opinion of NuVasive’s Financial Advisor;”
Likelihood of Completion of the Merger
 
•
the likelihood that the Merger will be completed, based on, among other factors, the limited closing conditions to the completion of the
Merger, the absence of a financing condition or similar contingency relating to Globus’s ability to obtain financing, and the commitment
made by Globus to take certain actions if required to obtain approval for the Merger required under the HSR Act, as further described in the
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters”;
 
•
the fact that shares of Globus Common Stock representing approximately 70% of the voting power of the outstanding Globus Common
Stock are subject to the Voting Agreement, pursuant to which the Supporting Stockholders have agreed to vote all such shares with respect
to the Globus Share Issuance Proposal in accordance with the recommendation of the Globus Board as of the time of the Globus Special
Meeting, as further described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The Voting Agreement”, and the fact that such
shares subject to the Voting Agreement are sufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal;
Favorable Terms of the Merger Agreement
 
•
the ability of NuVasive to, subject to specified limitations, respond to and engage in discussions regarding unsolicited third-party
acquisition proposals under certain circumstances and, ultimately, to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for a NuVasive Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with the procedural terms and conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement and the payment of a termination fee of $120 million, which is reduced to $75 million for terminations to accept certain
superior proposals during the Window Shop Period, as further discussed in the sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The
Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”;
 
-75-
Table of Contents
•
the terms of the Merger Agreement that restrict Globus’s ability to solicit and engage in alternative business combination transactions, as
further discussed in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation”;
 
•
the obligation of Globus to pay NuVasive by way of compensation a termination payment of up to $120 million upon termination of the
Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including as a result of Globus’s failure to obtain the requisite Globus stockholder
approval for the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, as further discussed in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The
Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee”;
Governance Matters
 
•
the fact that, at the Effective Time, three NuVasive directors (to be proposed by the NuVasive Board and acceptable to the Globus Board)
would be appointed to the Globus Board (one per each class of directors on the Globus Board), which will allow for oversight of and input
into the strategy of the Combined Company.
The NuVasive Board weighed these advantages and opportunities against a number of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning
the Merger Agreement and the transaction, including:
 
•
that Exchange Ratio would not be adjusted to compensate for changes in the price of Globus Class A Common Stock prior to the
consummation of the Merger. The NuVasive Board determined that the Exchange Ratio on the basis of which Globus Class A Common Stock
would be issued was appropriate and that the risks were acceptable in view of the relative historical trading values and financial
performance of NuVasive and Globus;
 
•

of the Merger and the potential effects on customers and business relationships;
 
•
the interim operating covenants in the Merger Agreement that restrict NuVasive’s ability to operate its business and engage in strategic
initiatives, and the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger, including the fact that completion of the Merger depends on factors
outside of NuVasive’s control, and that there can be no assurance that the conditions will be satisfied even if the NuVasive Merger Proposal
is approved by NuVasive stockholders;
 
•
the possibility of non-consummation of the Merger, including due to a failure to obtain the requisite approval under the HSR Act, and the
potential consequences of non-consummation, including the potential negative impacts on NuVasive, its business and the trading price of
NuVasive Common Stock;

Voting Agreement is limited by certain terms thereof;
 
•
the fact that Globus, following the Merger, will continue to have a controlling stockholder and will continue to be a “controlled company”
(as defined in NYSE rules);
 
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement permits Globus, subject to certain conditions, to respond to certain unsolicited acquisition proposals
prior to the time Globus stockholders approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal;
 
•
Globus’s ability, subject to certain conditions and in certain circumstances with the payment of a termination fee, to terminate the Merger
Agreement, as further discussed in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the
Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”;
 
•

the risks of litigation relating to the Merger; and
 
•
risks and other considerations of the type and nature described under the sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “Risk
Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
The NuVasive Board considered the factors described above as a whole, including through engaging in discussions with NuVasive senior
management and NuVasive’s outside legal and financial advisors. Based on this review and consideration, the NuVasive Board unanimously concluded
that these factors, on balance, supported a determination that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of NuVasive stockholders, and to make its recommendation to NuVasive
stockholders that they vote to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement.
In addition, the NuVasive Board was aware of and considered the fact that NuVasive’s directors and executive officers may have certain interests in
the transaction that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of NuVasive stockholders generally, as described in the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus titled “Interests of NuVasive Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors that the NuVasive Board considered is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. The
NuVasive Board collectively reached the conclusion to approve the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, in light of the various factors described above and other factors that the members of the NuVasive Board
believed appropriate. In view of the complexity and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, that the NuVasive Board considered in connection
with its evaluation of the transaction, the NuVasive Board did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or
specific weights or values to any

of the factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any
aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the NuVasive Board. In considering the factors discussed
above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the NuVasive Board in approving the Merger Agreement is forward-looking
in nature. This information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”",105,110

considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services
and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Globus Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. Goldman Sachs’ opinion is
not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Globus Common Stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:

NuVasive Standalone Projections, certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Globus standalone (which were referred to
earlier as the “Globus Standalone Projections”) and pro forma for the Merger based on the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone
Projections and the Globus Standalone Projections (the “Globus Pro Forma Projections”), in each case, as prepared by the
management of Globus and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Globus, including in the case of the Globus Pro Forma Projections
certain operating synergies and dis-synergies projected by the management of Globus to result from the Merger, as approved for
Goldman Sachs’ use by Globus (which were referred to earlier as the “Globus Synergy Projections”). See the section entitled
“—Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of Globus and NuVasive regarding their assessment of the past and
current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of
 
-78-Table of Contents
NuVasive and with the members of senior management of Globus regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial
condition and future prospects of Globus and the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the Merger; reviewed the reported price and trading
activity for the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock and the shares of NuVasive Common Stock; compared certain financial and stock market
information for Globus and NuVasive with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the
financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the healthcare industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses,
and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with Globus’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility
for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with Globus’s consent that the Globus Standalone Projections, the Globus
Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections and the Globus Pro Forma Projections, including the Globus Synergy Projections were reasonably prepared
on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Globus. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Globus or
NuVasive or any of their respective subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on
Globus or NuVasive or on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in
any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Globus to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger
as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Globus; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to Globus, as of the date of the opinion, of the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or
the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection
with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of Globus; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of Globus or NuVasive, or any class of such persons in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the Exchange
Ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions
as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumes no responsibility for
updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman
Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Globus Class A Common Stock or NuVasive Common Stock will trade at any time,
as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Globus or NuVasive or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on
the solvency or viability of Globus or NuVasive or the ability of Globus or NuVasive to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Material Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Globus Board in connection with rendering the
opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by
Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the
summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read

Table of Contents
together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the
following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 7, 2023 and is
not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. For purposes of its analysis, Goldman Sachs calculated $58.41 as the implied consideration per
share of NuVasive Common Stock to be paid to holders of shares of NuVasive Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, by multiplying the
Exchange Ratio by $77.88, the closing price of shares of Globus Class A Common Stock on February 7, 2023.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis—NuVasive Standalone
Using the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on NuVasive
on a standalone basis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of NuVasive Common Stock. Using the mid-year convention for
discounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 9.5%, reflecting estimates of NuVasive’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman
Sachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for NuVasive for the fiscal years 2023 through 2027 as
reflected in the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for NuVasive, as of December 31, 2027,
which were calculated by applying terminal year next twelve months’ (“NTM”) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”)
adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, litigation expenses and settlements, costs related to licensing and acquisition of in-process research and
development and non-recurring and other significant one-time items (the “NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA”) exit multiples ranging from 10.0x to 11.0x, to a
terminal year estimate of the NTM NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA to be generated by NuVasive, as reflected in the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone
Projections (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from 3.4% to 5.8%). The range of terminal year NTM NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA exit
multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical trading multiples of NuVasive
for February 2020 through February 2023. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”),
which requires certain company-specific inputs, including NuVasive’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on
permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for NuVasive, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States
financial markets generally.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for NuVasive by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman
Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for NuVasive the amount of NuVasive’s net debt (including the net present
value (“NPV”) of certain contingent liabilities relating to certain historical acquisitions, including the acquisition of Simplify Medical Pty Limited by
NuVasive (collectively, the “NuVasive Contingent Liabilities”)) as of December 31, 2022, as provided by the management of NuVasive and approved for
Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for NuVasive. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of
illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of NuVasive Common Stock, as provided by the management of
NuVasive and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present
values per share of NuVasive Common Stock ranging from $39.61 to $48.76.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis—NuVasive Standalone
Using the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an
illustrative future value per share of NuVasive Common Stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value (“EV”) for
NuVasive as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, by applying a range of multiples of illustrative EV to NTM NuVasive Adjusted
EBITDA (“NTM EV / NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA”) of 10.0x to 11.0x to estimates of NuVasive’s NTM NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA for each of the fiscal
years 2023 through 2025. This illustrative range of NTM EV / NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA multiple estimates was derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its
professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical NTM EV / NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA multiples for NuVasive for
February 2020 through February 2023.

Table of Contents
Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of NuVasive’s net debt (including the NPV of the NuVasive Contingent Liabilities), for each of the fiscal
years 2023 through 2025, each as provided by the management of Globus and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, from the
respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity values as of December 31 for NuVasive for each of the fiscal years 2023
through 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares of NuVasive
Common Stock for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, calculated using information provided by the management of NuVasive and approved for
Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, to derive a range of implied future values per share of NuVasive Common Stock. Goldman Sachs then
discounted these implied future equity values per share of NuVasive Common Stock to December 31, 2022, using an illustrative discount rate of 9.2%,
reflecting an estimate of NuVasive’s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain
company-specific inputs, including a beta for NuVasive, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis
resulted in a range of implied present values of $42.32 to $49.49 per share of NuVasive Common Stock.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions in the healthcare industry. For each of the selected
transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied enterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in
the transaction as a multiple of the target company’s last twelve months’ (“LTM”) adjusted EBITDA based on information in public filings and press
releases. While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to NuVasive, the companies that participated
in the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of NuVasive’s results,
market sizes and product profile.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference
range of EV / LTM adjusted EBITDA multiples based on information in public filings of 11.7x to 16.9x to NuVasive’s LTM NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA as
of December 31, 2022, as provided by the management of NuVasive and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, to derive a
range of implied enterprise values for NuVasive. Goldman Sachs then subtracted the net debt (including the NPV of the NuVasive Contingent Liabilities)
of NuVasive as of December 31, 2022, as provided by the management of NuVasive and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus,
and divided the result by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of NuVasive Common Stock as of February 6, 2023, as provided by the
management of NuVasive and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a reference
range of implied values per share of NuVasive Common Stock of $45.56 to $72.21.
Premia Paid Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-stock mergers announced from January 1,
2013 through February 7, 2023 involving a public company based in the United States as the target where the disclosed equity values for the transaction
were between $0.5 billion and $5.0 billion and the acquiror had a pro forma ownership of the combined company between 60% and 75%. This analysis
excluded transactions in the banking, financial services, insurance, oil and gas, real estate and utilities industries. For the entire period, using publicly
available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the eight transactions relative
to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 19.5% across
the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 14.9% and 75th percentile premium of 30.1% across the period, respectively. Using
this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 14.9% to 30.1% to the undisturbed closing price per share of NuVasive
Common Stock of $46.91 as of February 7, 2023 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of NuVasive Common Stock of $53.89 to $61.03.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis – Globus Standalone
Using the Globus Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Globus on a standalone basis
to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and
discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%, reflecting estimates of Globus’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value
as of December 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Globus for the fiscal years 2023 through 2027 as reflected in the Globus Standalone
Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Globus, as of December 31, 2027, which were calculated by applying terminal year NTM
EBITDA, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, litigation expenses and settlements, costs related to acquisitions and costs related to licensing
and acquisition of in-process research and development (the “Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA”) exit multiples ranging from 16.5x to 18.5x, to a
terminal year estimate of the NTM Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA to be generated by Globus, as reflected in the Globus Standalone Projections
(which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from 4.6% to 6.9%). The range of terminal year NTM Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA exit
multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical trading multiples of Globus
for February 2020 through February 2023. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the CAPM which requires certain company-
specific inputs, including Globus’s standalone target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if
any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Globus on a standalone basis, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial
markets generally.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Globus on a standalone basis by adding the ranges of present values it derived
above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative
 
-82-
Table of Contents
enterprise values it derived for Globus on a standalone basis the amount of Globus’s net debt (including the NPV of certain contingent liabilities relating
to the acquisition of Excelsius Surgical and other transactions by Globus (collectively, the “Globus Contingent Liabilities”)) on a standalone basis, as of
December 31, 2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for
Globus. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Globus
Common Stock, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range
of illustrative present values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock ranging from $73.27 to $84.74.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis – Globus Standalone
Using the Globus Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future
value per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value for Globus as of
December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, by applying a range of multiples of illustrative EV to NTM Globus Standalone Adjusted
EBITDA (“NTM EV / Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA”) of 16.5x to 18.5x to estimates of Globus’s NTM Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA for
each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025. This illustrative range of NTM EV / Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA multiple estimates was derived by
Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical NTM EV / Globus Standalone Adjusted
EBITDA multiples for Globus for February 2020 through February 2023.
Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Globus’s net debt (including the NPV of the Globus Contingent Liabilities) on a standalone basis, for
each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, each as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, from the respective
implied enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity values as of December 31 for Globus for each of the fiscal years 2023 through
2025. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Globus Common
Stock for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, calculated using information provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management
of Globus, to derive a range of implied future values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied future
equity values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock to December 31, 2022, using an illustrative discount rate of 9.8%, reflecting an estimate of
Globus’s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs,
including a beta for Globus, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of
implied present values of $67.60 to $76.35 per share of Globus Class A Common Stock.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis – Globus Pro Forma
Using the Globus Pro Forma Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Globus pro forma for the
Merger to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash
flows and discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%, reflecting estimates of Globus’s pro forma weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs
discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Globus pro forma for the Merger for the fiscal years 2023
through 2027, as reflected in the Globus Pro Forma Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Globus, as of December 31, 2027, which
were calculated by applying terminal year NTM EBITDA, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, litigation expenses and settlements, costs
related to acquisitions, costs related to licensing and acquisition of in-process research and development and non-recurring and other significant one-
time items (the “Globus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA”) exit multiples ranging from 13.5x to 15.5x, to a terminal year estimate of the NTM Globus Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA to be generated by Globus on a pro forma basis, as reflected in the Globus Pro Forma Projections (which analysis implied perpetuity
growth rates ranging from 3.9% to 6.4%). The
 
-83-
Table of Contents
range of terminal year NTM Globus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA exit multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and
experience, taking into account historical trading multiples of Globus and NuVasive for February 2020 through February 2023. Goldman Sachs derived
such discount rates by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Globus’s pro forma target capital structure
weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Globus pro
forma for the Merger, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Globus pro forma for the Merger by adding the ranges of present values it
derived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative pro forma enterprise values it derived for Globus, the pro forma net debt
(including the NPV of the NuVasive Contingent Liabilities, the NPV of the Globus Contingent Liabilities and estimate transaction fees with respect to the
Merger) of Globus as of December 31, 2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, to derive a range of
illustrative equity values for Globus on a pro forma basis. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the pro forma
number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of
Globus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock ranging from $77.66
to $93.53.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis – Globus Pro Forma
Using the Globus Pro Forma Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future
value per share of Globus Class A Common Stock pro forma for the Merger. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value
for Globus pro forma for the Merger as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, by applying a range of multiples of illustrative EV to
NTM Globus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (“NTM EV / Globus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA”) of 13.5x to 15.5x to estimates of Globus’s NTM Globus Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025. This illustrative range of NTM EV / Globus Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA multiple estimates was derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and
historical NTM EV / Globus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA multiples for Globus and NuVasive for February 2020 through February 2023.
Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Globus’s pro forma net debt (including the NPV of the NuVasive Contingent Liabilities, the NPV of
the Globus Contingent Liabilities and estimate transaction fees with respect to the Merger), for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, each as
provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, from the respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a range
of illustrative equity values as of December 31 for Globus on a pro forma basis for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided
these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock on a pro forma basis for each
of fiscal years 2023 through 2025, calculated using information provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Globus, to
derive a range of implied future values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock on a pro forma basis. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied
future equity values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock to December 31, 2022, using an illustrative discount rate of 9.7%, reflecting an estimate of
Globus’s pro forma cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific
inputs, including a beta for Globus and NuVasive, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis
resulted in a range of implied present values of $69.62 to $85.58 per share of Globus Class A Common Stock pro forma for the Merger.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without

considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness
determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered
by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results
of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Globus or NuVasive or the Merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs providing its opinion to the Globus Board as to the fairness from a
financial point of view to Globus, as of February 8, 2023, of the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be
appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future
results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their
respective advisors, none of Globus, NuVasive, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from
those forecasts.
The Exchange Ratio was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Globus and NuVasive and was approved by the Globus Board.
Goldman Sachs provided advice to Globus during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio to Globus
or the Globus Board or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio for the Merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Globus Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Globus Board in
making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs
attached as Annex C.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates
and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at
any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default
swaps and other financial instruments of Globus, NuVasive and any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including affiliates of Mr. David C. Paul,
a significant stockholder of Globus, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Globus in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. During the two-year period ended February 8, 2023, Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has not been engaged
by Globus or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. During the two-
year period ended February 8, 2023, Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has not been engaged by NuVasive or its affiliates to provide financial advisory
or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. During the two-year period ended February 8, 2023, Goldman Sachs
Investment Banking has not been engaged by Mr. David C. Paul or his affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman
Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Globus, NuVasive,
Mr. David C. Paul and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking may receive compensation.
The Globus Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has
substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated January 30, 2023, Globus engaged Goldman Sachs to act
as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between Globus and Goldman Sachs provides for a

transaction fee of $6.0 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Globus has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs
for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Adjusted EPS (as described in the section entitled “—Certain NuVasive Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”) of $2.28 for the calendar year
2023, respectively, to determine implied per share equity values. Estimated financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly
available research analysts’ estimates, and estimated financial data of NuVasive were based on the Revised NuVasive Standalone Projections. This
analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for NuVasive, as compared to the per share price of NuVasive

Table of Contents
forecasted to generate during NuVasive’s fiscal years 2023 through 2027 based on the Revised NuVasive Standalone Projections. BofA Securities
calculated terminal values for NuVasive by applying last-twelve-month EBITDA terminal multiples of 9.5x to 11.5x to NuVasive’s fiscal year 2027 estimated
adjusted EBITDA, which implied a perpetuity growth rate ranging between 5.2% and 6.4%. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to
present value as of December 31, 2022, assuming a mid-period convention for cash flows, using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 11.0%. From the
resulting enterprise values, BofA Securities deducted net debt as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 (treating the amount of the 2023
Convertible Notes, defined below in the section entitled “—Call Spread Transactions,” and the amount of NuVasive’s convertible senior notes due 2025,

Has/Gets Analysis. BofA Securities performed a has/gets analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for holders of NuVasive Common
Stock resulting from the Merger based on a comparison of (i) the 100% ownership by holders of NuVasive Common Stock of NuVasive on a stand-alone
basis and (ii) the pro forma ownership by holders of NuVasive Common Stock of Globus after giving effect to the Merger.
For the NuVasive Common Stock on a stand-alone basis, BofA Securities used the implied reference range indicated in its discounted cash flow
analysis described above under “—Summary of NuVasive Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.” BofA Securities then performed the
same analysis by calculating the range of implied per share equity values allocable to holders of NuVasive Common Stock on a pro forma basis, giving
effect to the Merger, by assuming approximately 28.1% pro forma ownership, based on the number of Globus Class A Common Stock estimated to be
issued to holders of NuVasive Common Stock in the Merger, utilizing the results of the standalone discounted cash flow analyses for NuVasive and
Globus described above under “ —Summary of Material NuVasive Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” and “—Summary of Material
Globus Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” and taking into account the net present value of the Assumed Synergies and Dis-
synergies and the decreased cash from the Merger to the Combined Company. BofA Securities calculated the approximate net present value of Assumed
Synergies and Dis-synergies to the Combined Company as of December 31, 2022 using a discount rate range of 9.0% to 11.0%. Per NuVasive management
guidance, the analysis assumed a terminal value for the Assumed Synergies and Dis-synergies beyond 2027 assuming a range of perpetuity growth rates
of 2.0% to 3.0%.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied pro forma per share equity value reference range for NuVasive Common Stock giving
effect to the Merger, based on the Exchange Ratio, for each share of NuVasive Common Stock, compared to the range of implied per share equity values
for NuVasive Common Stock on a standalone basis:

Other Factors. BofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities’ material financial analyses
with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:  
 
•
using the historical trading prices of NuVasive Common Stock and Globus Class A Common Stock described above, BofA Securities
calculated an approximate implied exchange ratio reference range of 0.438x to 1.126x;
 
•
using publicly available equity research analyst price targets for NuVasive Common Stock and Globus Class A Common Stock described
above, BofA Securities calculated an approximate implied exchange ratio reference range of 0.419x to 0.962x.
Miscellaneous. As noted above, the discussion set forth above under “—Summary of Material NuVasive Financial Analyses,” “—Summary of
Material Globus Financial Analyses” and “—Summary of Material Relative Financial Analyses” is a summary of the material financial analyses presented
by BofA Securities to the NuVasive Board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by BofA
Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the
most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a
financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses summarized above must
be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information
presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view
 
-93-
Table of Contents
of the processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not
meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many
of which are beyond the control of NuVasive and Globus. The estimates of the future performance of NuVasive in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses
are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those
suggested by BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the Exchange Ratio and were provided to the NuVasive Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade
at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’ view of the actual values of NuVasive or Globus.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between NuVasive and Globus, rather than by
any financial advisor, and was approved by the NuVasive Board. The decision to enter into the Merger agreement was solely that of the NuVasive Board.
As described above, BofA Securities’ opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the NuVasive Board in its evaluation of the
proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the NuVasive Board or management with respect to the Merger or the
Exchange Ratio.
NuVasive has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee, which is estimated, based on the
information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $27 million, $3 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion and
the remainder of which is contingent upon the completion of the Merger. NuVasive also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred
in connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives
trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset
and investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,
governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates invest on a principal basis or on behalf of
customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity,
debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of NuVasive, Globus and certain of their
respective affiliates.  
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial
banking and other financial services to NuVasive and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services,
including (i) having acted or acting as financial advisor to NuVasive in connection with certain mergers and acquisition transactions, (ii) having acted or
acting as an administrative agent, bookrunner and/or arranger for, and/or as a lender under, certain letters of credit, credit facilities and other credit
arrangements of NuVasive and/or certain of its affiliates, (iii) having provided or providing certain derivatives, foreign exchange and other trading
services to NuVasive and/or certain of its affiliates, and (iv) having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to
NuVasive and/or certain of its affiliates. In addition, BofA Securities have maintained, currently are maintaining, and in the future may maintain,
commercial (including vendor and/or customer) relationships with NuVasive and/or certain of its affiliates. From February 1, 2021 through January 31,
2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates

derived aggregate revenues from NuVasive and certain of its affiliates of approximately $6 million for investment and corporate banking services.
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide investment banking,
commercial banking and other financial services to Globus and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these
services, including (i) having acted or acting as a lender under certain letters of credit, credit and leasing facilities and other credit arrangements of Globus
and/or certain of its affiliates, (ii) provided or providing certain foreign exchange and other trading services to Globus and/or certain of its affiliates, and
(iii) having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Globus and/or certain of its affiliates. From February 1, 2021
through January 31, 2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Globus and certain of its affiliates of approximately $3 million
for investment and corporate banking services.
Call Spread Transactions
Concurrent with NuVasive’s issuance in June 2020 of $450 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the “2023
Convertible Notes”), NuVasive entered into separate convertible bond hedge transactions (the “Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions”) and issuer
warrant transactions (the “Issuer Warrant Transactions” and, collectively with the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions, the “Call Spread Transactions”)
with four banks (each a “Call Spread Counterparty” and collectively, the “Call Spread Counterparties”), including Bank of America, N.A. (“BANA”), an
affiliate of BofA Securities, acting as principal for its own account in respect of 20% of the Call Spread Transactions.
The Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions consisted of the purchase by NuVasive from the Call Spread Counterparties of call options in respect of
the number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock initially underlying the 2023 Convertible Notes, expiring when the Notes mature (i.e., June 1, 2023), and
with an initial strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the 2023 Convertible Notes of approximately $84.1907. The Issuer Warrant Transactions
consist of the sale by NuVasive to such Call Spread Counterparties of warrants in respect of the same number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock and
with an initial strike price of $104.8410. The strike prices of the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions and Issuer Warrant Transactions are subject to
certain adjustments. Because the Convertible Bond Hedges expire and the 2023 Convertible Notes mature on June 1, 2023, it is possible that neither the
Convertible Bond Hedges nor the 2023 Convertible Notes will remain outstanding by the time the Merger is consummated. The Issuer Warrant
Transactions expire over a series of expiration dates commencing September 1, 2023 and ending November 27, 2023.
If the Merger is consummated prior to maturity of the 2023 Convertible Notes, the 2023 Convertible Notes would become convertible into the
acquirer’s shares and the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions would similarly become exercisable for the acquirer’s shares. To the extent that the post-
merger volatility of the acquirer’s shares were to exceed the volatility of NuVasive Common Stock before the announcement of the merger, the fair value of
the Call Spread Counterparties’ liabilities under the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions would increase, and to the extent the post-merger volatility of
the acquirer’s shares were less than the volatility of NuVasive Common Stock before the announcement of the merger, the fair value of the Call Spread
Counterparties’ liabilities under the Convertible Bond Hedge Transaction would decrease.
Following the announcement or consummation of the Merger, the Call Spread Counterparties may adjust the terms of the Issuer Warrant
Transactions to preserve the fair value of the Transactions after taking into account the announcement or consummation. Each Call Spread Counterparty
will determine, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner as calculation agent with respect to its Issuer Warrant Transaction, the economic
effect of such an announcement or consummation on the value of its Issuer Warrant Transaction and may take into account a number of factors,
including, for example, the date of the announcement (and the remaining term of the Issuer Warrant Transactions at that time), the stock price and
changes in volatility, stock loan rate, liquidity and expected dividends of NuVasive Common Stock. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
 
-95-
Table of Contents
Issuer Warrant Transactions will become convertible into the acquirer’s shares. Each Call Spread Counterparty must also make additional adjustments to
its Issuer Warrant Transaction following the announcement of a change to the Merger (including the withdrawal, abandonment or discontinuation of the
Merger).
Under the Call Spread Transactions to which it is a counterparty, BANA has market exposure to the price of shares of NuVasive Common Stock. It is
standard industry practice, and BANA’s ordinary practice, to engage in hedging activities to reduce market exposure to the price of the common stock
underlying derivative transactions such as the Call Spread Transactions. Such hedging includes BANA or its affiliates either purchasing or selling shares
of the NuVasive Common Stock or related instruments to offset the exposure to the NuVasive Common Stock that BANA has under the Call Spread
Transactions. BANA’s hedging is intended to substantially reduce BANA’s exposure under the Call Spread Transactions to changes in the price of shares
of the NuVasive Common Stock.
Hedging does not fully offset every risk or change in market conditions. Hedging is designed to offset a range of normal price movements under a
range of typical market conditions, based on publicly available information, and thus might not fully offset extraordinary market events or conditions
(such as the announcement or consummation of a merger transaction) that might have a material effect on the price, volatility or other characteristics of
NuVasive Common Stock. BANA’s hedging activity is at its own risk and might result in a loss or profit to BANA in an amount that might be less than or
greater than the expected contractual benefit or loss to BANA under the Call Spread Transactions it entered into. BANA’s ultimate loss or profit with
respect to the Call Spread Transactions after taking into account its hedging activity would depend on many factors, including the original net premium
received by BANA for the Call Spread Transactions, the price at which BANA established its initial hedge position in respect of the Call Spread
Transactions, the deliveries or payments made or received pursuant to the Call Spread Transactions, the profit and loss realized by BANA in connection
with rebalancing its stock hedge positions during the term of the Call Spread Transactions (such rebalancing occurring as frequently as intra-day), and
the premium or other amounts paid, and payments received, in connection with entering into or maintaining any option position or other derivative
transaction used to hedge the Call Spread Transactions, the volatility of shares of the NuVasive Common Stock and the prices at which BANA would
close out these hedge positions. The amount of any loss or profit would not be known until all of the Call Spread Transactions to which BANA is a party
have been exercised, expired or terminated and BANA has completed all of its related hedge unwind activities. In accordance with industry practices,
BofA Securities maintains an enterprise information wall reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by or to
employees in its investment banking division to or by employees on the “public” side of BofA Securities, including the employees who undertake these
hedging and other market transactions. However, a portion of any gain or loss BANA experiences with respect to the Call Spread Transactions, including
any termination payment, may be shared with BofA Securities’ investment banking division.
BANA has advised NuVasive that the announcement or occurrence of an acquisition transaction may cause BANA to recognize contractual
benefits or losses in connection with the Call Spread Transactions. In particular, BANA may recognize a benefit or loss owing to changes in the volatility
of the shares of NuVasive Common Stock before announcement of the Merger relative to the volatility post announcement, (including of the acquiror’s
shares post consummation of the Merger) and the impact of such change on the value of the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions. However, as noted
above, under the Issuer Warrant Transaction, BANA is required to make an adjustment to preserve the transaction’s fair value after taking into account
the Merger (or announcement thereof). As a result, BANA may suffer a contractual loss on its Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions, but have to forgo a
contractual benefit on the Issuer Warrant Transactions. For instance, BANA has advised NuVasive that, based on certain specified assumptions
(including a share price of $55.00), if the volatility of NuVasive Common Stock increased as a result of the announcement or occurrence of the Merger by
(including a share price of $55.00), if the volatility of NuVasive Common Stock increased as a result of the announcement or occurrence of the Merger by
10% from 50% to 60%, BANA’s portion of the liability under the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions could increase in value in favor of NuVasive (or its
successor) by approximately $566,000. By contrast, while the value of the Issuer Warrant Transactions to BANA on those same assumptions could
increase by approximately $1.1 million, BANA would be required to adjust the Issuer Warrant Transactions to preserve the fair value of
 
-96-
Table of Contents
such transactions to NuVasive, thereby depriving BANA of such increase in value. As a further illustrative example, BANA has advised NuVasive that,
based on those same assumptions and assumed change in volatility but with an assumed stock price of $60.00, BANA’s portion of the liability under the
Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions could increase in value by approximately $857,000 and the value of the Issuer Warrant Transactions could increase
by approximately $1.5 million.
BANA advised NuVasive that, as the value changes described in the prior paragraph illustrate, the impact of any such changes to the Call Spread
Transactions is likely to be limited because NuVasive’s stock price was well below the strike prices for each Call Spread Transaction and, as noted above,
the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions will expire in June 2023 and the Issuer Warrant Transactions expire in September to November 2023, all of which
limits the value of the Call Spread Transactions (and therefore the amount of any potential adjustments) as a whole. However, the amount of any such
contractual benefit or loss to BANA will depend on a number of factors as described above, including market conditions at the time, BANA’s hedging
activities and when the Merger occurs relative to the maturities of the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions and Issuer Warrant Transactions. There can
be no assurance that the market assumptions used in calculating such contractual benefit or loss to BANA will match or approximate actual market
conditions and, thus, the actual magnitude of any benefit or loss to BANA may be greater or less than such estimate. The amount of any such
contractual benefit or loss will not be known until the Call Spread Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their terms
and BANA and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind activities.
The indenture governing the 2023 Convertible Notes and the confirmations containing the terms of the Call Spread Transactions were included as
exhibits to NuVasive’s report on Form 8-K filed by NuVasive with the SEC on May 27, 2020. All references in this section captioned “—Call Spread
Transactions” to share counts, conversion prices and strike prices may change from time to time in accordance with the terms of the relevant
confirmations.

Other than its financial guidance and business outlook provided in connection with its quarterly earnings announcements, Globus does not as a
matter of course make public projections as to future performance, revenues, production, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the
inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the
underlying assumptions and estimates. In connection with the Merger, Globus management prepared (i) certain unaudited prospective financial
information of Globus on a standalone basis for the fiscal years 2023 through 2027, which information is referred to as the “Globus Standalone
Projections,” (ii) a preliminary version of the Globus Standalone Projections, referred to as the “Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections,” (iii) the
synergy and dis-synergy projections described below under “—Summary of the Globus Synergy Projections,” which information is referred to as the
“Globus Synergy Projections” and (iv) certain unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 for the Combined Company
on a pro forma basis, which information is referred to as the “Globus Pro Forma Projections.” Globus management also made certain adjustments to
certain unaudited prospective financial information prepared by NuVasive management of NuVasive on a standalone basis for the fiscal years 2023
through 2027 (referred to earlier as the “NuVasive Standalone Projections”), which such adjusted financial information is referred to as the “Globus
Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections.” The Globus Standalone Projections, the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections, the Globus Adjusted
NuVasive Standalone Projections, the Globus Pro Forma Projections, and the Globus Synergy Projections are referred to collectively as the “Globus
Projections.”
The Globus Projections were prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure. The Globus Projections, other than the Preliminary
Globus Standalone Projections, were provided to the Globus Board for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the Merger. The Globus
Projections were also provided to Goldman Sachs, Globus’s financial advisor, for the purposes of its financial analysis, as described in the section
 
-97-Table of Contents
titled “The Merger—Opinion of Globus’s Financial Advisor.” Goldman Sachs did not rely on the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections for the
purposes of its financial analysis. The Globus Standalone Projections, the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections and the Globus Synergy Projections
were provided to NuVasive in connection with its consideration and evaluation of the Merger and to NuVasive’s financial advisor, BofA Securities. The
Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections and the Globus Pro Forma Projections were not provided to NuVasive or to BofA Securities.
The Globus Standalone Projections and the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections were prepared treating Globus on a standalone basis,
without giving effect to the Merger, including (i) any impact of the negotiation or execution of the Merger Agreement or the Merger; (ii) the expenses that
have already and will be incurred in connection with completing the Merger; (iii) the potential synergies that may be achieved by the Combined Company
as a result of the Merger; (iv) the effect of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement
having been executed or in anticipation of the Merger; or (v) the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been
taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the Merger.
Because the Globus Standalone Projections and the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections were developed for Globus as an independent company
without giving effect to the Merger, they do not reflect any divestitures or other restrictions that may be imposed in connection with the receipt of any
necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, synergies that may be realized as a result of the Merger or any changes to Globus’s operations or
strategy that may be implemented after completion of the combination.
The Globus Projections are not included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to influence any decision on whether to vote for the Globus Share
Issuance Proposal or the NuVasive Merger Proposal, but rather are included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to give stockholders access to
certain non-public information that was provided to the Globus Board and Globus’s financial advisor, and to NuVasive and its financial advisor. The
inclusion of the Globus Projections should not be regarded as an indication that the Globus Board, Globus, the NuVasive Board, NuVasive or their
respective members of management or financial advisors or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, them to be necessarily
predictive of actual future results, and they should not be relied on as such. There can be no assurance that the projected results will be realized or that
actual results of Globus, NuVasive, or the Combined Company will not be materially lower or higher than estimated, whether or not the Merger is
completed. The Globus Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date they were prepared or as of the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Globus may in the future report results of operations for periods included in the Globus Standalone Projections
and the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections that will be completed following the preparation of the Globus Standalone Projections and the Globus
Preliminary Projections. Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to Globus’s periodic filings with the SEC for information on Globus’s actual
historical results.
The Globus Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines
established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, or
GAAP, but, in the view of Globus management, were assumed to have been, reasonably prepared in good faith on a basis reflecting the best available
estimates and judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the
expected future financial performance of Globus and, in the case of the Globus Pro Forma Projections and the Globus Synergy Projections, the combined
company. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily predictive of actual future results, and readers of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Globus Projections. Although Globus management believes there is a
reasonable basis for the Globus Projections, Globus cautions stockholders that actual future results could be materially different from the Globus
Projections. Neither Globus’s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with
respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such
information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.

Table of Contents
The Globus Projections are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented with
numerical specificity, the Globus Projections are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered
reasonable by Globus management, as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be impacted by any number of
factors, including the impact of the announcement, pendency and consummation of the combination, general economic conditions, trends in the medical
device industry, regulatory and financial market conditions and other risks and uncertainties described or incorporated by reference in the sections titled
“Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus, all of which are difficult
to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Globus and will be beyond the control of the combined company. Also see the section titled
“Where You Can Find More Information.” The Globus Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.
There can be no assurance that the Globus Projections will be realized, and actual results will likely differ, and may differ materially, from those shown.
Generally, the further out the period to which the Globus Projections relate, the less predictive the information becomes.
The Globus Projections contain certain adjusted financial measures that Globus management believes are helpful in understanding the applicable
company’s past financial performance and future results. Globus management regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance
with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring financial performance. The adjusted financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation
or as a substitute for, or superior to, comparable GAAP measures. While Globus believes these adjusted financial measures provide meaningful
information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze Globus’s financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis, there
are limitations associated with the use of these adjusted financial measures. These adjusted financial measures are not prepared in accordance with
GAAP, are not reported by all of Globus’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Globus’s competitors due to
potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of an adjusted financial measure to a
GAAP financial measure do not apply to adjusted financial measures provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed
business combination such as the combination if the disclosure is included in a document such as this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition,
reconciliations of adjusted financial measures were not relied upon by the Globus Board, the NuVasive Board or their respective members of management
or financial advisors in connection with their respective evaluation of the combination. Accordingly, Globus has not provided a reconciliation of the
adjusted financial measures included in the Globus Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
None of Globus, NuVasive, the Combined Company or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can provide
any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Globus Projections, and, except as required by applicable law, none of Globus, NuVasive, the
Combined Company or their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Globus Projections to reflect
circumstances existing after the date the Globus Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all
of the assumptions underlying the Globus Projections are shown to be inappropriate. None of Globus, NuVasive or their respective affiliates, officers,
directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any Globus stockholder, NuVasive stockholder or other person
regarding Globus’s or NuVasive’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Globus Projections or that forecasted results will be
achieved. Globus has made no representation to NuVasive, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Globus Projections.
Summary of the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections
Before creating the Globus Standalone Projections, Globus management prepared certain preliminary unaudited prospective financial information of
Globus on a standalone basis for Globus’s fiscal years 2023 through 2027, reflecting a base set of assumptions based on revenue and profitability, the
absence of any

Summary of the Globus Standalone Projections
The following table presents a summary of the unaudited prospective financial information of Globus on a standalone basis prepared by Globus
management for Globus’s fiscal years 2023 through 2027, which information is referred to as the “Globus Standalone Projections.” Globus management
made adjustments to the Preliminary Globus Standalone Projections to prepare the Globus Standalone Projections, including increasing net revenue and
profitability to more closely align with Globus management’s long term expectations for the performance of Globus. The increase in profitability was
primarily driven by the volume impact of higher sales, as well as greater fixed cost leverage. The Globus Standalone Projections reflect various
assumptions of Globus Management, including Globus’s continued expansion of spine products in the United States, penetration of existing markets in
Europe, Asia and South America, expansion and penetration of Globus’ imaging, navigation and robotic solutions driven by new product launches,
vendor consolidation, and continued vertical integration. The Unlevered Free Cash Flow figures set forth below were arithmetically derived from the
Globus management projections by Goldman Sachs and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Globus.

NUVASIVE INC_20230328_DEFM14A_20755850_4630097.Pdf,Certain NuVasive Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,"Certain NuVasive Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
While NuVasive has from time to time provided a financial outlook to investors with respect to the then-current fiscal year and certain key metrics
for longer-term financial performance goals, NuVasive has not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed detailed longer-term internal projections
as to future performance, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying
assumptions and estimates. However, in the ordinary course of business, NuVasive management prepares a five year long range business plan, which is
periodically updated and reviewed with the NuVasive Board, that reflects NuVasive management’s financial and business outlook for NuVasive generally
over a five-year period. As part of NuVasive’s annual business review, NuVasive management prepared and reviewed with the NuVasive Board, at its
November 2, 2022 meeting, NuVasive’s long range business plan for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 (the “NuVasive LRBP”). Based on the NuVasive LRBP,
NuVasive management prepared certain nonpublic, internal financial projections, analysis and plans for fiscal years 2022 through 2027 (referred to earlier
as the “NuVasive Standalone Projections”), which representatives of BofA Securities, financial advisor to NuVasive, shared on January 11, 2023 with
representatives of Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to Globus.
Also in January 2023 and in the first week of February, in conjunction with the preparation of NuVasive’s 2023 operating budget, NuVasive
management revised its projections for the 2023 fiscal year, primarily as a result of updated assumptions regarding the impact of foreign currency
exchange rates on NuVasive’s business. NuVasive management’s projections for the 2024 to 2027 fiscal years did not change. On February 5, 2023, the
NuVasive Board met to review and approve the NuVasive 2023 operating budget, which included revisions to the earlier 2023 projections. Following the
NuVasive Board’s approval of the 2023 operating budget, NuVasive management updated the NuVasive Standalone Projections to reflect the revised
projections for the 2023 fiscal year (as defined earlier, the “Revised NuVasive Standalone Projections”). Thereafter, on February 5, 2023, NuVasive
management provided the Revised NuVasive Standalone Projections to representatives of BofA Securities. On February 6, 2023, representatives of BofA
Securities shared the Revised NuVasive Standalone Projections with representatives of Goldman Sachs.
NuVasive management directed BofA Securities to use and rely upon, for purposes of its financial analysis and fairness opinion, the Revised
NuVasive Standalone Projections (as more fully described in the section titled “Opinion of NuVasive’s Financial Advisor”). The NuVasive LRBP, the
NuVasive Standalone Projections and the Revised NuVasive Standalone Projections are collectively referred to as the “NuVasive Standalone Prospective
Financial Information.”
The NuVasive Standalone Prospective Financial Information was prepared treating NuVasive on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the
proposed transaction, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the
 
-102-Table of Contents
proposed transaction, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with the proposed transaction or the consummation thereof, the potential
synergies that may be achieved by the Combined Company as a result of the proposed transaction, the effect of any business or strategic decision or
action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed or in anticipation of the proposed transaction, or the
effect of any alteration, acceleration, postponement or decision not to take any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been
taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the
transaction.
As described in the section titled “—Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,” Globus management prepared and provided
to NuVasive and BofA Securities certain unaudited prospective financial information of Globus on a standalone basis for fiscal years 2023 through 2027,
which financial information was defined previously as the “Globus Standalone Projections”, except that the calculation of Globus’s Unlevered Free Cash
Flow described in the section titled “—Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” differs from NuVasive’s calculation of Globus’s
Unlevered Free Cash Flow (which was provided to BofA Securities and used for purposes of its analyses). NuVasive’s calculation of Globus’s Unlevered
Free Cash Flow refers to Globus’s Adjusted Operating Income, less taxes, plus depreciation, less change in net working capital, less capital expenditures
and less projected payments for Acquisition of Business and Business Acquisition Liabilities. Globus’s Adjusted Operating Income is defined as
Globus’s Adjusted EBITDA less stock-based compensation, less depreciation. As further described below, the NuVasive Board was also presented with
certain unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 for the Combined Company on a pro forma basis, comprised, at the
direction of NuVasive management, of the Revised NuVasive Standalone Projections and the Globus Standalone Projections (the “NuVasive Combined
Company Projections”). The NuVasive Combined Company Projections were prepared on a basis different than the historical pro forma financial
information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in the section titled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”
The NuVasive Combined Company Projections assumed: (i) revenue synergies (cross-sell party products) of approximately $30 million, $140 million, $205
million, $215 million, and $235 million in Year 1 through Year 5 following the closing of the Merger, respectively, (ii) annual run-rate revenue dis-synergies
of approximately $201 million, phased in over two years (with 50% in Year 1 following the closing of the Merger and 100% in Year 2 through Year 5
following the closing of the Merger); (iii) annual cost synergies of approximately $170 million, phased in over three years (with 50% in Year 1 following the
closing of the Merger, 75% in Year 2 following the closing of the Merger, and 100% in Year 3 through Year 5 following the closing of the Merger), and (iv)
the closing of the Merger occurring on June 30, 2023. These assumed synergies and dis-synergies (collectively, “Assumed Synergies and Dis-
synergies”) were not reflected in the NuVasive Standalone Prospective Financial Information. The Assumed Synergies and Dis-synergies were provided
to BofA Securities, which was directed by NuVasive management to use and rely upon the Assumed Synergies and Dis-synergies for purposes of its
financial analysis and fairness opinion. The NuVasive Combined Company Projections were presented to the NuVasive Board on February 8, 2023.
The NuVasive Combined Company Projections were not provided to Globus or to Globus’s financial advisor, Goldman Sachs. Except for the Globus
Standalone Projections utilized by NuVasive management (and incorporated as a component of the NuVasive Combined Company Projections), the
NuVasive Combined Company Projections do not reflect the input of Globus management.
The NuVasive Combined Company Projections do not take into account certain potential effects of the Merger, including certain expenses that
have been and may be incurred in connection with the Merger or the consummation thereof or any changes to the Combined Company’s operations or
strategy that may be implemented after completion of the Merger. The NuVasive Combined Company Projections assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger would be obtained without any adverse effect on the
Combined Company or on Assumed Synergies and Dis-synergies and that the Merger would close on June 30, 2023.
The NuVasive Standalone Prospective Financial Information and the NuVasive Combined Company Projections are referred to collectively as the
“NuVasive Projections.”

Table of Contents
A summary of the NuVasive Projections is being included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to give NuVasive stockholders access to certain
non-public information provided to the NuVasive Board and NuVasive’s financial advisor and to Globus and its financial advisor. The inclusion of the
financial projections by NuVasive should not be regarded as an indication that the NuVasive Board, NuVasive, the Globus Board, Globus, BofA Securities,
Goldman Sachs or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, them to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or
an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such.
In addition, the NuVasive Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward compliance with the published
guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial
information or
GAAP, but, in the view of NuVasive’s management were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time
of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the
expected future financial performance of NuVasive or the Combined Company, as applicable. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied
upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
the NuVasive Projections. Although NuVasive’s management believes there is a reasonable basis for the NuVasive Projections, NuVasive cautions
stockholders that future results could be materially different from the NuVasive Projections. This summary of the NuVasive Projections is included in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus because the NuVasive Projections were provided to NuVasive’s financial advisor and to the NuVasive Board for
purposes of considering and evaluating the transaction and the Merger Agreement.
The NuVasive Projections are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented
with numerical specificity, the NuVasive Projections are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though
considered reasonable by NuVasive’s management as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for
any number of reasons, including general economic conditions, trends in the medical device industry, the regulatory environment, competition, and the
risks discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus under the sections entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and
“Risk Factors.” See also “Where You Can Find Additional Information.” The NuVasive Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business
decisions that are subject to change. Because the NuVasive Standalone Projections were developed for NuVasive on a standalone basis without giving
effect to the transaction, they do not reflect any synergies that may be realized as a result of the transaction or any changes to NuVasive’s operations or
strategy that may be implemented after completion of the transaction. There can be no assurance that the NuVasive Projections will be realized, and actual
results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the NuVasive Projections relate, the less predictable and
more unreliable the information becomes.
The NuVasive Projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that NuVasive believes are helpful in understanding its past financial
performance and future results. NuVasive management regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for
forecasting, budgeting and measuring financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While NuVasive believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help
investors understand the operating results and to analyze NuVasive’s financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations
associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not
reported by all of NuVasive’s or Globus’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of NuVasive’s or Globus’s
competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of an adjusted
financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to adjusted financial measures provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor in
connection with a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition, reconciliations of adjusted financial
 
-104-
Table of Contents
measures were not relied upon by the NuVasive Board, the Globus Board or their respective members of management or financial advisors in connection
with their respective evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, NuVasive has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in
the NuVasive Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
None of NuVasive, Globus, the Combined Company or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives can provide
any assurance that actual results will not differ from the NuVasive Projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise
or reconcile, the NuVasive Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the NuVasive Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence
of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the NuVasive Projections are shown to be in error. Except as required by
applicable securities laws, NuVasive does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the NuVasive Projections, even in the
event that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. None of NuVasive, Globus or their affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other
representatives has made or makes any representation to any NuVasive stockholder or other person regarding NuVasive’s ultimate performance compared
to the information contained in the NuVasive Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved. NuVasive has made no representation to Globus, in
the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the NuVasive Projections. The NuVasive Projections are forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
The NuVasive Projections included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, NuVasive management. Ernst & Young
LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial
information and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the accompanying
prospective financial information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Ernst & Young LLP disclaims any association with the unaudited
prospective financial information included in this document. Ernst & Young LLP’s report included in or incorporated by reference in this document relate
to previously issued financial statements. They do not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so. Neither Globus’s
independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective
financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and
assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.

The closing of the Merger will take place as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within three business days) after satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions to closing (described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the
Consummation of the Merger”) other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of such conditions, or such other date as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by NuVasive, Globus and
Merger Sub.
At the closing, NuVasive, Globus and Merger Sub will cause a certificate of merger relating to the Merger to be to be executed, acknowledged and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at
such time as the certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed
by NuVasive and Globus in writing and specified in the certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL.
Globus and NuVasive currently expect the Merger to close in the middle of 2023 and are working to complete the Merger on this timeline. However,
it is possible that factors outside the control of the parties to the Merger Agreement could result in the Merger being completed at a different time, or not
at all.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Globus has agreed to take all necessary action to cause, as of the Effective Time, an increase in the size of the
Globus Board to eleven directors, and to authorize and effect the appointment of three additional directors from the NuVasive Board to the Globus Board,
with such individuals to be proposed by the NuVasive Board and acceptable to the Globus Board. Each such additional NuVasive designated director will
serve on the Globus Board until such individual’s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable law. One of each of
the three additional NuVasive directors will be appointed as a member of each of the three classes of directors serving on the Globus Board. In the event
any such NuVasive Director is or becomes unable or unwilling prior to the Effective Time to serve on the Globus Board in the role identified, a replacement
for such director will be determined prior the closing. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the members of the NuVasive Board who
will serve on the Globus Board following the Effective Time have not yet been identified.
Following the Merger, Globus is expected to continue to be a “controlled company.” Under NYSE rules, a “controlled company” may elect not to
comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that a majority of its directors be independent, as defined in NYSE
rules, and the requirement that its compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees consist entirely of independent directors.
Globus relies, and may continue to rely, on the “controlled company” exemption under NYSE rules. As a result, a majority of the members of its board may
not be independent directors and its nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees may not consist entirely of independent
directors.",139,139

The obligations of Globus and NuVasive to consummate the Merger are subject to, among other conditions, the expiration or earlier termination of
any waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act.
Under the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed unless certain waiting period requirements have expired or
been terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file a notification and report form with the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “Antitrust Division”) and the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”). A transaction
notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their respective
notification and report forms. If the Antitrust Division or the FTC issues a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material (a “Second
Request”) prior to the expiration of this initial 30-calendar-day waiting period, the transaction cannot close until the parties observe a second 30-calendar-
day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless such second waiting
period is terminated earlier. The parties filed their respective notification and report forms pursuant to the HSR Act on March 3, 2023. Unless extended or
earlier terminated, the 30-calendar-day waiting period under the HSR Act will expire on April 3, 2023.
At any time before the Effective Time, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any state could take such action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest with respect to the Merger, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally approve the
Merger upon the divestiture of assets, or to impose restrictions on the operations of NuVasive or Globus following the completion of the Merger. Private
parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that the Merger will not be
challenged on antitrust grounds or, if such a challenge is made, that the challenge will not be successful.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Globus and NuVasive have agreed to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and to cause their respective directors, executive officers and other representatives to take, all actions, to file, or
cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable law to consummate and make effective the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as
soon as reasonably practicable, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations,
approvals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods from governmental bodies and making all necessary registrations and filings and taking all
steps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain any such consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a
waiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any governmental body in connection with any applicable law; (ii) obtaining all
necessary consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers from third parties; (iii) defending any lawsuit or other legal proceeding, whether judicial or
administrative, brought by any governmental body or third party challenging the Merger Agreement or seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit or
make illegal consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and contesting any order that enjoins,
restrains, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including, resolving any objections of or challenge made by any governmental body or third party to the merger or any other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement under any antitrust law; (iv) refraining from taking any other action that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger; and (v) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

In furtherance of and consistent with Globus’s obligation to use its reasonable best efforts, Globus has agreed to take, and to cause to be taken, all
actions and things necessary, proper or advisable to eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust law that is asserted by any governmental
body, to obtain the consent or cooperation of any other person, and to permit and cause the satisfaction of the closing relating to the expiration or earlier
termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act and the absence of legal restraints against the Merger, in each of the
foregoing cases, to permit the closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the End Date, including:

ownership of the shares of NuVasive Common Stock.
However, (A) Globus is not required to propose, commit to, effect or agree to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license, holding separate or other disposition of any business, asset, property or product line of NuVasive, Globus or any of their respective
subsidiaries that generated total net sales in excess of $40 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2022, and (B) NuVasive is only required
to take or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction as requested by Globus if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or
restriction is binding on NuVasive only in the event the closing occurs. With respect to any action described in the bullet points immediately above,
Globus is required to consult with NuVasive and consider in good faith any efforts proposed by NuVasive to mitigate the adverse impact of any action on
the expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Litigation Relating to the Merger
On March 16, 2023, a complaint, captioned O’Dell v. NuVasive, Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-02262, was filed by a purported NuVasive stockholder in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against NuVasive and its directors. The complaint alleges that the defendants filed or
caused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC which omitted material information
relating to the Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiff’s requested relief,
among others, includes an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Merger, requiring the defendants to disclose allegedly material
information that was allegedly omitted from the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus, rescission of the Merger Agreement, rescissory damages,
awarding costs and such other and further equitable relief as the court may deem just and proper. NuVasive and Globus believe that the claims asserted in
the complaint are without merit.
As of March 23, 2023, neither NuVasive nor Globus was aware of the filing of other lawsuits challenging the Merger or the joint proxy
statement/prospectus. However, NuVasive and/or Globus stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the Merger naming NuVasive, Globus, and
members of their respective boards of directors and/or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits, including the
amount of costs associated with defending, settling, or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of, such
claims.
Listing of Globus Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of NuVasive Common Stock
It is a condition to the Merger that Globus Class A Common Stock to be issued to NuVasive stockholders in the Merger be approved for listing on
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. If the Merger is completed, NuVasive Common Stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the
Exchange Act, following which NuVasive will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to NuVasive Common Stock.

The Merger Agreement and the summary of its terms and conditions in this joint proxy statement/prospectus have been included to provide

agent: (i) the maximum number of shares of Globus Class A Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration (to be represented by book-entry shares
of Globus Class A Common Stock); and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make any necessary payments in lieu of fractional shares. Promptly following
the Effective Time, Globus is required to cause the exchange agent to mail to the record holders of certificates that represented shares of NuVasive
Common Stock: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Globus and NuVasive may reasonably specify (including a
provision confirming that delivery of certificates will be effected, and risk of loss and title to shares of NuVasive Common Stock will pass, only upon
delivery of such certificates to the exchange agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.
With respect to uncertificated shares of NuVasive Common Stock held through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), Globus and NuVasive are
required to cooperate to establish procedures with the exchange agent and DTC to ensure that the exchange agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within five business days thereafter, upon surrender of shares held of record by DTC or its
nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares).
With respect to uncertificated shares of NuVasive Common Stock not held through DTC, Globus is required to instruct, and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause, the exchange agent to pay and deliver to each holder of record of any such stock, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, but in any event within five business days thereafter, the applicable Merger Consideration and a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in the Merger Agreement) of any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Globus Class A Common Stock
otherwise payable to such holder of uncertificated shares.
With respect to certificated shares of NuVasive Common Stock, upon surrender of a certificate to the exchange agent for exchange, together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the exchange agent or Globus, the holder of such
certificate will be entitled to receive (A) in exchange a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing the number of whole shares of
Globus Class A Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Globus Class A Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by the procedures outlined in this paragraph, each certificate will be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration specified in the Merger Agreement. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of NuVasive Common Stock that is not registered in NuVasive’s transfer records, any portion of the Merger Consideration may be
issued or paid (including in cash in lieu of fractional shares) to a person other than the person in whose name such certificate so surrendered is registered
if such certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such issuances and/or payments will pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of such issuance and/or payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of
such shares of NuVasive Common Stock or establish to the satisfaction of Globus that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable. If any certificate is
lost, stolen or destroyed, Globus may require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a
bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the exchange agent, Globus or the surviving corporation with respect to such certificate.

Globus has agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time in favor of the present and former directors, officers, and employees of NuVasive or any of its subsidiaries as provided in
NuVasive’s and its subsidiaries’ organizational documents, and specified indemnification agreements of NuVasive and its subsidiaries in effect as of the
date of the Merger Agreement, will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Globus has agreed to
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the organizational documents of NuVasive’s subsidiaries to contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from liabilities of present and former directors,
officers, and employees of NuVasive or its subsidiaries than are currently provided in NuVasive’s and its subsidiaries’ organizational documents. Globus
has agreed that these provisions may not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to such matters and (ii) six years from the Effective Time, and, in the event that
any action is pending or asserted or made during such period, until the disposition of any such action, unless such amendment, modification or repeal is
required by applicable law.
From and after the Effective Time, Globus and the Surviving Corporation are required to, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is or was a current or former director or officer of NuVasive or any of its subsidiaries or was serving, at the request or for the benefit of
NuVasive or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, as a director, trustee or officer of any other entity or any NuVasive benefit plan,

against all obligations to pay any threatened, asserted, pending or completed judgment, damages, settlement, losses, liabilities, or fine or penalty, interest
and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative, and whether formal or
informal, by reason of the fact that the indemnified party is or was an officer or director of NuVasive or its subsidiaries, or an officer, trustee or director of
another entity if such service was at the request of NuVasive, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
provided for under applicable law, NuVasive’s organizational documents, the organizational documents of NuVasive’s subsidiaries and indemnification
agreements of NuVasive and its subsidiaries.
NuVasive is permitted, prior to the Effective Time, to purchase a tail policy or policies under the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policies maintained at such time by NuVasive, and if NuVasive does not obtain such tail policy or policies prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Globus
or the Surviving Corporation are required to obtain such policy or policies. The tail policy or policies (i) are required to be effective for a period from the
Effective Time through and including the date six years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from acts, errors or omissions that existed or
occurred prior to or at the Effective Time and (ii) are required to provide coverage and amounts that are at least as protective to such directors and
officers as the coverage provided by such existing policies and must contain other terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered
individuals as the terms and conditions in such existing policies; provided, that the total annual premium for such tail policy or policies may not be in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by NuVasive prior to the Effective Time. If such tail policy or policies cannot be obtained or can be
obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in excess of the maximum premium, Globus, or the Surviving Corporation are only required to obtain
as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the maximum premium. Globus is required to cause such tail policy or
policies (whether obtained by NuVasive, Globus or the Surviving Corporation) to be maintained in full force and effect for their full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

VOTING AGREEMENT",173,174
NUVASIVE INC_20230328_DEFM14A_20755850_4630097.Pdf,VOTING AGREEMENT,"VOTING AGREEMENT
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on February 8, 2023, Globus and NuVasive entered into the Voting Agreement with the
Supporting Stockholders. The following summary describes certain material provisions of the Voting Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as
Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The description of the Voting Agreement in this section and elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Voting Agreement.
Voting Commitment. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, until the earliest to occur of (a) the Effective Time, (b) a Globus Adverse Recommendation
Change, (c) receipt of the approval of Globus stockholders for the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, and (d) such date and time as the Merger Agreement
is validly terminated (which we refer to collectively as the “Expiration Time”), at every meeting of Globus stockholders at which the Globus Share
Issuance Proposal is to be voted on (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), and on any action or approval of Globus stockholders by
written consent with respect to the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, the Supporting Stockholders are required to vote all of their shares of Globus
Common Stock in accordance with the recommendation of the Globus Board as of the time of the Globus Special Meeting with respect to the Globus
Share Issuance Proposal. Even though a special meeting is required to be held and all Globus stockholders of record on the Globus Record Date have a
right to vote on the proposals presented at the Globus Special Meeting, the shares of Globus Class B Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement will
be sufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus Adjournment Proposal.
Until the Expiration Time, at every meeting of Globus stockholders (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), the Supporting
Stockholders are required to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting (or cause the holders of record on any applicable record date to be
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Supporting Stockholders’ shares of Globus Common Stock to be counted as present
for purposes of establishing a quorum.
As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the shares of Globus Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement represent
approximately 70% of the total voting power of outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock and therefore such shares of Globus Common Stock are
sufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus Adjournment Proposal.
Transfer Restrictions. Until the Expiration Time, the Supporting Stockholders have agreed not to directly or indirectly transfer any of their shares of
Globus Common Stock, other than (i) with the prior written consent of NuVasive, or (ii) (a) to any member of their immediate family, or to a trust for the
benefit of the Supporting Stockholders or any member of their immediate family, or otherwise for estate planning purposes, (b) by will or under the laws of
intestacy upon their death or (c) pursuant to a qualified domestic order; provided, however, that the transfers described in clause (ii) are only permitted if
the transferee agrees in a written document, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to NuVasive, to be bound by all of the terms of the Voting
Agreement.
Regulatory Support. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of the Merger Agreement, the Supporting Stockholders are
required to use their reasonable best efforts to assist and cooperate in obtaining the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any
extension thereof) under the HSR Act, and have agreed not to take any action which would limit, impair or delay Globus in taking any action or making
any commitment or otherwise complying with its regulatory efforts covenant set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described in the section of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus titled “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Approvals”). The Supporting Stockholders are not required to divest or agree to
any restriction on any Globus Common Stock held by the Supporting Stockholders.
Non-Solicitation. Until the Expiration Time, the Supporting Stockholders have agreed not to take any action that Globus is prohibited from taking
under the non-solicitation restrictions applicable to it under the Merger
 
-142-Table of Contents
Agreement (or permit any entity under their control to take such actions), as described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The
Merger Agreement—No Solicitation.”
Termination. The Voting Agreement will automatically terminate and will have no further force or effect as of the Expiration Time, except that the
obligations described above under “Regulatory Support” will continue until the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of the Merger
Agreement.
Exclusive Remedy. The Voting Agreement provides that NuVasive’s right to receive the one-time payment of the Globus Termination Fee (as
defined in the section titled “Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses”) pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement will
be the sole and exclusive remedy available to NuVasive or any of its former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers, affiliates, agents or
representatives against Globus or the Supporting Stockholders or any of Globus’s respective former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers,
affiliates, agents or representatives with respect to the Voting Agreement or any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Supporting Stockholders
contained in the Voting Agreement, and, upon such payment of the Globus Termination Fee, (i) in no event may NuVasive or any of its former, current or
future equityholders, directors, officers, affiliates, agents or representatives seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on
a claim in law or equity with respect to any breach, termination or failure of or under the Voting Agreement and (ii) none of Globus or the Supporting
Stockholders or any of Globus’s former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers, affiliates, agents or representatives will have any further
liability relating to or arising out of the Voting Agreement. NuVasive has expressly waived the right to seek specific performance of the Supporting
Stockholders’ obligations or covenants under the Voting Agreement and has agreed not to seek any injunction, order or other equitable remedy with
respect to the performance of the Supporting Stockholders’ obligations under the Voting Agreement or the voting of their shares of Globus Common
Stock.

On February 8, 2023, Globus, Merger Sub, and NuVasive entered into the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into NuVasive with NuVasive continuing as the surviving
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Globus.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 gives effect to the Merger as if this transaction had been
completed on December 31, 2022 and combines the audited consolidated balance sheet of Globus as of December 31, 2022 with the audited consolidated
balance sheet of NuVasive as of December 31, 2022.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 give effect to the Merger as if
it had occurred on January 1, 2022. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022
combines the audited consolidated statement of operations of Globus for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and the audited consolidated
statement of operations of NuVasive for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation S-X. 
The historical condensed consolidated financial statements of Globus and the historical consolidated financial statements of NuVasive have been
adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to give effect to pro forma events that are transaction
accounting adjustments which are necessary to account for the combination, in accordance with GAAP. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based
upon available information and certain assumptions that Globus management believes are reasonable.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial information, as well as the information and financial statements referenced in the section titled “Where You Can
Find More Information.”
The Merger is being accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method with Globus as the accounting acquirer in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations. Under this method of accounting, the aggregate merger
consideration will be allocated to NuVasive’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of completion of
the Merger. The process of valuing the net assets of NuVasive immediately prior to the Merger, as well as evaluating accounting policies for conformity, is
preliminary. Any differences between the estimated fair value of the consideration transferred and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. Accordingly, the aggregate Merger Consideration allocation and related adjustments reflected in this
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information are preliminary and subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily
indicative of what the Combined Company’s financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the combination occurred as of the
dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also should not be considered indicative of the future results of
operations or financial position of Globus.
The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information as required by SEC rules. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final combination accounting may be material.

GLOBUS MEDICAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (amounts in thousands except per share amounts)
1. Basis of Presentation
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared in accordance with Article 11 of SEC Regulation S-X as amended
by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 “Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.” Release No. 33-10786 replaces
the existing pro forma adjustment criteria with simplified requirements to depict the accounting for the transaction and present the reasonably estimable
synergies and other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur (referred to as management adjustments). Globus has
elected not to present management adjustments and will only be presenting transaction accounting adjustments related to the accounting for the Merger
(the “pro forma adjustments”) in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The adjustments presented in the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary to assist in understanding
the Combined Company upon consummation of the Merger.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, have been prepared by combining
the Globus and NuVasive statements of operations for the period and applying the related pro forma adjustments.
The pro forma adjustments have been prepared as if the Merger related to NuVasive occurred on December 31, 2022, for the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined balance sheets and on January 1, 2022, for the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. The pro forma
adjustments are based on currently available information and certain estimates and assumptions, and therefore the actual effects of these transactions
will differ from the pro forma adjustments.
Upon completion of the Merger, Globus will control NuVasive, and accordingly will be the accounting acquirer. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information has been prepared by Globus using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. Under this method,
the aggregate consideration will be allocated to NuVasive’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their acquisition date estimated fair
values. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be allocated to goodwill. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information is based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets and liabilities to be acquired, which requires
significant assumptions. Globus management believes that the assumptions used provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects of the
transactions and that the pro forma adjustments in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives appropriate effect to the
assumptions. These assumptions may change upon the finalization of the fair value, which would have a corresponding impact on the pro forma financial
information.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the impact of any potential restructuring or integration
activities that have yet to be determined, nor the impact of possible cost or growth synergies expected to be achieved by the Combined Company, as no
assurance can be made that such cost or growth synergies will be achieved.
The accounting policies followed in preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information are those used by Globus as set
forth in the historical financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects any material adjustments known at
this time to conform NuVasive historical financial information to Globus’s significant accounting policies based on Globus management’s review of
NuVasive’s summary of significant accounting policies, as disclosed in the NuVasive historical financial statements. Globus does not have an existing
accounting policy for ASU No. 2020-06, Debt

with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). Following the
acquisition, Globus will adopt NuVasive’s historical accounting policy, and amounts will be reflected within the condensed combined financial statements
accordingly. Upon completion of the acquisition and a more comprehensive comparison and assessment, additional differences may be identified that
could have a material impact on the combined financial statements.
The consummation of the Merger remains subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including NuVasive Stockholder Approval, Globus
Stockholder Approval, and regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that the Merger will occur on or before a certain time on the terms
described herein, or at all.
2. Preliminary Consideration
The preliminary consideration is calculated as follows:
 
(In thousands, except share price and exchange ratio)
Share Consideration:
NuVasive shares outstanding
53,208(i)
Globus exchange ratio
0.75
Globus common shares to be issued in exchange for NuVasive shares
39,906
Globus closing share price
$
60.50(ii)
 
 
 
 
Total estimated purchase price
$2,414,314
 
 
 
 
 
(i)
The NuVasive shares outstanding of 53,208 includes 52,192 shares of NuVasive Common Stock as of February 6, 2023 and 425 NuVasive RSU
Awards and 591 NuVasive PRSU Awards expected to vest as of the merger date.
(ii)
The share price is based on an assumed transaction date of February 16, 2023, and will be adjusted to reflect the estimated share price on the date
of closing. Any change in the share price will have an associated impact on the total fair value of the consideration.
The estimated value of the consideration does not purport to represent the actual value of the total consideration that will be received by the
NuVasive stockholders when the Merger is completed. The fair value of the equity securities issued as consideration will be measured on the closing date
of the proposed Merger at the then-current market price per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. As a result of the subsequent fair value
measurement of these securities, total consideration will likely change from what is presented in this calculation. For example, an increase or decrease of
10% in the price of Globus Class A Common Stock on the closing date of the Merger compared to the price of Globus Class A Common Stock assumed in
the estimated fair value of the consideration would change the value of the preliminary consideration by approximately $241,431, which would be reflected
as a corresponding increase or decrease to goodwill.

(i)
The preliminary fair value of work-in-process and finished goods inventory utilizes a sales comparison approach which estimates the selling price
of the inventory in completed condition less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
(ii)
Preliminary fair value of property and equipment utilizes a combination of the cost approach, income approach, and sales comparison approach less
amounts for capitalized research and development costs existing on NuVasive’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.
(iii)
The preliminary fair value of the identifiable intangible assets was determined using variations of the income approach, namely the multi-period
excess earnings and relief from royalty methodologies. The most significant assumptions applied in the development of the intangible asset fair
values include: the amount and timing of future cash flows, the selection of discount and royalty rates, and the assessment of the asset’s economic
life. Final identifiable intangible asset valuation results may differ from the pro forma estimates if the above assumptions and methodologies are
modified or if additional intangible assets are identified. The final valuation will be completed within 12 months of the completion of the merger.
(iv)
Preliminary fair value of other assets adjusted to eliminate historical goodwill from NuVasive’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.
(v)
Preliminary fair value of the deferred income tax liability was adjusted to reflect the estimated deferred tax impacts related to acquisition accounting
adjustments primarily as a result of the step-up in fair value of intangible assets, inventory, and property and equipment. The incremental deferred
tax impacts were calculated based on the tax effect of the estimated step-up in book basis of the net assets of NuVasive using an estimated
statutory tax rate of 24.0%. Tax expense was adjusted to record the income tax impacts of the merger adjustments using the same rate. This rate
does not reflect the Combined Company’s effective tax rate, which includes other items and may be significantly different than the rates assumed
for purposes of preparing these statements.
(vi)
Preliminary fair value of senior convertible notes due 2023 and 2025 was determined using trade price for note transactions on February 16, 2023.
The preliminary estimates were based on the data available to Globus and may change upon completion of the final purchase price allocation. Any
change in the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired or the estimated fair value of the consideration will have a corresponding impact on
the amount of goodwill recorded. A change in identifiable intangible assets will have a direct impact on the amount of amortization recorded against
income in future periods. The impact of any changes in the purchase price allocation could have a material impact on the amounts presented in the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in future periods.

work-in-process and finished goods. The fair value adjustment to inventories is estimated to be expensed over a period of 12 months,
which is reflected as a pro forma adjustment in cost of sales. This charge will be included in the Combined Company’s statement of
operations subsequent to the merger and is expected to be released over the normal sales cycle, which is estimated to be
approximately 12 months.
 
(ii)
Recognition of the property and equipment assets at the preliminary fair value, offset by the historical property and equipment assets
of NuVasive and the associated impact on depreciation expense. The pro forma adjustment was calculated as follows:

(iv)
The pro forma adjustment of $626,108 represents the preliminary estimate of goodwill of $1,265,771, offset by NuVasive’s historical
goodwill of $639,663. The goodwill, which is attributable to long-term advancements in Globus’s technology, synergies in operations,
the assembled workforce, and growth through new channels to be achieved from the combined operations of Globus and NuVasive,
represents the excess of total consideration over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The pro forma adjustments resulting from the purchase price allocation were based on preliminary estimates, as described above, and
may be revised upon finalization of the fair value estimates. The impact of such adjustments may have a material impact on the pro
forma financial information. For example, an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair value of intangible assets on the closing date of
the Merger from the fair value of intangible assets assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
would change the value of the intangible assets approximately by $166,286, which would be reflected as a corresponding increase or
decrease to straight-line amortization expense of $12,781 assuming an average useful life of 13,
 
-150-
Table of Contents
14, and 10 years for developed technology, customer relationships, and tradenames and trademarks, respectively. Similarly, a change
in the estimated purchase price of 10% would result in a change of $241,431 to the purchase price and a corresponding change in the
goodwill.

Other than with respect to continued service for, employment by and the right to continued indemnification by the Combined Company, and the
rights and obligations of the Supporting Stockholders under the Voting Agreement, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Globus
directors and executive officers do not have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Globus stockholders
generally. The Globus Board was aware of and considered these factors, among other matters, in reaching its determination that the terms of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Globus and its stockholders, approving and deeming advisable the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and recommending that Globus
stockholders approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal. For more information, see “The Merger—Background of the Merger” and “The Merger—
Globus’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Globus Board of Directors.”
Following the consummation of the Merger, all eight of the current members of the Globus Board are expected to continue as members of the
Globus Board. David C. Paul, Chair of the Globus Board and Executive Chairman, is expected to continue to serve as Chair of the Globus Board and
Executive Chairman. In addition, Globus’s executive officers are expected to continue to serve as the executive officers of Globus.

In considering the recommendation of the NuVasive Board with respect to the NuVasive proposals, NuVasive stockholders should be aware that the
directors and executive officers of NuVasive have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of NuVasive
stockholders generally. The members of the NuVasive Board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating,
negotiating and approving the merger agreement and in determining to recommend that NuVasive stockholders approve the NuVasive Merger Proposal.
For more information, see the sections titled “The Merger—Background of the Merger” and “The Merger—NuVasive’s Reasons for the Merger and
Recommendation of the NuVasive Board of Directors.” Such interests are described in more detail below.
The NuVasive named executive officers included in the summary below are J. Christopher Barry, Chief Executive Officer; Matthew K. Harbaugh,
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Nathaniel B. Sisitsky, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary; and Dale Wolf,
Senior Vice President, Global Operations. In addition, the one NuVasive executive officer who is covered by this summary who is not a named executive
officer is Michael Farrington, Senior Vice President, People and Culture. Massimo Calafiore and Brent J. Boucher are also deemed to be named executive
officers, but because they separated from employment with NuVasive on August 31, 2022 and September 1, 2021, respectively, they will not receive any
benefit that is payable or that may become payable that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger other than the Merger Consideration in respect of
any shares of NuVasive Common Stock that they own, and they are not included in the disclosure below.  
Treatment of NuVasive Equity Awards
The treatment of outstanding NuVasive equity awards held by NuVasive employees at the Effective Time is summarized below. The outstanding
NuVasive equity awards held by NuVasive’s executive officers will be treated in the same manner as those NuVasive equity awards held by other
employees of NuVasive and in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable to such awards before the Effective Time. The outstanding
NuVasive equity awards held by NuVasive’s non-employee members of the NuVasive Board will be treated in accordance with the terms and conditions
that were applicable to such awards before the Effective Time.
Treatment of NuVasive RSU Awards. The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each NuVasive RSU Award outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will (1) if held by a non-employee member of the NuVasive Board, fully vest and be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive (without interest) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of NuVasive Common Stock underlying such NuVasive RSU
Award, and (2) if not held by a non-employee member of the NuVasive Board, automatically be converted and assumed or replaced by Globus, in
accordance with, and remaining subject to, the terms and conditions of the applicable NuVasive equity plan and award agreement by which it is
evidenced, including any service-based vesting conditions, except that each such converted Globus award will be denominated in a number of shares of
Globus Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock subject to the applicable NuVasive RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Globus Class A
Common Stock.
Treatment of NuVasive PRSU Awards. The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each NuVasive PRSU Award outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than certain NuVasive PRSU Award held by consultants to NuVasive) will automatically be converted and
assumed or replaced by Globus, in accordance with, and remaining subject to, the terms and conditions of the applicable NuVasive equity plan and award
agreement by which it is evidenced as each is in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, including any service-based vesting conditions but
excluding any performance-based vesting conditions, except that each such assumed Globus award will be denominated in a number of shares of Globus
Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (x) 100% of the target number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock subject to such NuVasive
 
-154-Table of Contents
PRSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to adjustment to reflect actual 2023 performance to the extent reasonably determinable prior
to the Effective Time if the Effective Time occurs in the 2024 calendar year), multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number of
shares of Globus Class A Common Stock.
The estimated value of the unvested NuVasive equity awards held by each of the named executive officers is set forth below in “ —Quantification
of Potential Payments and Benefits to NuVasive’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger.” Based on the same assumptions set forth
in such section (including the applicable footnotes to the table included in such section), (i) the estimated aggregate value that would be realized by the
NuVasive executive officer who is not a named executive officer in respect of his unvested NuVasive equity awards upon a termination without “cause” or
for “good reason” at the Effective Time is: NuVasive RSU Awards—$1,127,694 and NuVasive PRSU Awards—$251,090, and (ii) the estimated aggregate
value that would be realized by the eight non-employee members of the NuVasive Board in respect of their unvested NuVasive RSU Awards is $1,353,680.
Change in Control Agreements
Each of NuVasive’s executive officers is party to a change in control agreement that provides for certain severance benefits upon a termination of
employment by NuVasive other than for “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason” (each, a “qualifying termination”) that occurs within two
years following a change in control. The Merger will constitute a change in control under the change in control agreements.
The change in control agreements provide for the following entitlements upon a qualifying termination within two years following a change in
control, subject to the executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims:
 
•
Receive a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of the following amounts:
 
•
One and one-half times (two times for Messrs. Barry and Harbaugh) the executive officer’s “annual compensation” (defined as the
sum of (x) one year of the executive officer’s base salary at the highest rate at which the executive officer was paid at any time during
the 12 months prior to his separation from service and (y) the greater of (A) the executive officer’s target annual bonus for the year in
which the separation from service occurs and (B) the highest annual bonus paid to the executive officer out of the three prior bonuses
paid to the executive officer prior to his separation from service);
 
•
For Messrs. Barry and Harbaugh, the product of (x) the highest grant date fair value of any long-term incentive award (cash and/or
equity-based) granted to him in the three calendar year period prior to the calendar year of his separation from service and (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial calendar months between January 1 of the year of separation from
service and the date of the executive officer’s separation from service (provided that such numerator will not exceed six) and the
denominator of which is 12;
 
•
The “benefit cash-out amount,” meaning the product of (x) 229.56% and (y) the sum of (A) the total cost of the projected premiums
for group medical, dental and vision coverage, (B) the cost to NuVasive of providing the executive officer with group short- and long-
term disability, group term life, company-paid voluntary life and certain other benefits for a 24 month period, and (C) the cost to
NuVasive of providing the executive officer with a qualified plan defined contribution match (assuming the executive officer makes the
maximum amount of employee contributions allowed under such plan), in each case for 24 months following the executive officer’s
separation from service; and
 
•
The product of (x) the greater of (A) the executive officer’s target annual bonus amount for the year in which the separation of service
occurs and (B) the highest annual bonus paid to the executive officer out of the three prior bonuses paid to him prior to his separation
from service

Table of Contents
and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial calendar months between January 1 of the year of
separation from service and the date of the executive officer’s separation from service, and the denominator of which is 12; and
 
•
Become fully vested in all equity and long-term incentive awards granted to the executive officer, with the final number of units and/or
shares payable under any performance shares or performance unit awards determined in accordance with the applicable grant
agreement. In addition, pursuant to the applicable NuVasive RSU Award or NuVasive PRSU Award agreements, if the executive officer
is terminated without cause at any time following a change in control, the award will become vested upon termination.
The change in control agreements also contain provisions relating to the length of the exercise period applicable to any stock options or stock
appreciation rights held by the executive officer following a qualifying termination, however, none of the executive officers holds any NuVasive stock
options or stock appreciation rights. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to or in connection with the change in
control agreements, NuVasive will reimburse the executive officer for reasonable attorney fees, costs and expenses incurred if the executive officer
substantially prevails on the merits with respect to any breach of the agreement by NuVasive.
For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to NuVasive’s named executive officers under
their change in control agreements upon a qualifying termination in connection with the Merger, see the section titled “—Quantification of Potential
Payments and Benefits to NuVasive’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger.” Based on the same assumptions set forth in such
section (including the applicable footnotes to the table included in such section), the estimated aggregate amount of the lump sum cash severance
payment (including all components described above) that would be payable to the NuVasive executive officer who is not a named executive officer under
his change in control agreement is $1,241,761.
NuVasive Excise Tax Gross-Up Plan
In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, on February 8, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the NuVasive Board adopted the
NuVasive, Inc. Excise Tax Gross-Up Plan (the “Plan”) to provide each executive officer with the right to receive a gross-up payment in the event that any
payments or benefits provided to such executive officer in connection with the Merger become subject to the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The payments would generally place each participant in the same after-tax position that they would have been in if the excise tax
did not apply to such executive officer, subject to an aggregate $4 million cap on the total amount of gross-up payments that may be made to participants
under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a participant’s payments or benefits exceed his applicable Section 280G safe harbor amount
by 10% or less, the participant will instead receive a reduction of payments and benefits to the extent necessary to cause the payments not to become
subject to the excise tax. The Plan was adopted solely in connection with the Merger and therefore will automatically terminate if the Merger Agreement is
terminated without the consummation of the Merger.
For an estimate of the value of the gross-up payments described above that would be payable under the Plan to NuVasive’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger, see the section titled “ —Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to NuVasive’s Named Executive
Officers in Connection with the Merger.” Based on the same assumptions set forth in such section (including the applicable footnotes to the table
included in such section), the estimated aggregate amount of the gross-up payments that would be payable to the NuVasive executive officer who is not a
named executive officer under the Plan is $1,127,933.
2023 Annual Bonus Plan
Globus and NuVasive have agreed that the Compensation Committee of the NuVasive Board is permitted to take action to determine the level of
achievement of the applicable performance goals under the NuVasive 2023
 
-156-
Table of Contents
annual bonus plan in respect of the portion of the 2023 performance year elapsed prior to the Effective Time, based on the greater of 75% of target
performance and actual performance for any fully completed performance period within the 2023 performance year (consisting of first half of 2023, third
quarter of 2023, and fourth quarter of 2023) and based on target performance for the performance period within the 2023 performance year in which the
Effective Time occurs. Such performance determination will govern the amount of the 2023 annual incentive awards to be paid after the Effective Time to
employees, including executive officers, who remain employed and eligible to receive a full year bonus.  
Membership on the Globus Board and Post-Closing Services
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Globus has agreed to take all necessary action to cause, as of the Effective Time, an increase in the size of the
Globus Board to eleven directors, and to authorize and effect the appointment of three additional directors from the NuVasive Board, proposed by the
NuVasive Board and acceptable to the Globus Board. Each such additional NuVasive designated director will serve on the Globus Board until such
individual’s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable law. One of each of the three additional NuVasive
designated directors will be appointed as a member of each of the three classes of directors serving on the Globus Board. In the event any such NuVasive
Director is or becomes unable or unwilling prior to the Effective Time to serve on the Globus Board in the role identified, a replacement for such director
will be determined prior the Effective Time pursuant to the process set forth above. Non-employee members of the Globus Board will be compensated for
such service. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, no decisions have been made as to the members of the NuVasive Board who will
serve on the Globus Board following the Effective Time. For additional information, see “The Merger—Governance Matters After the Merger.”
In addition, it is possible that certain of NuVasive’s executive officers may continue to provide services to Globus after the Effective Time. Any of
NuVasive’s executive officers who become officers or employees or are otherwise retained to provide services to Globus or the Surviving Corporation
may, prior to, at or following the Effective Time, enter into new individualized compensation arrangements with Globus or the Surviving Corporation and
may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Globus or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, it has not been determined which, if any, executive officers may continue as members of the Globus management team or the
positions that such individuals may hold after the Merger, and no new individualized compensation arrangements between Globus and any of NuVasive’s
executive officers have been agreed or established.
Indemnification and Insurance
Under the Merger Agreement, Globus agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in favor of the present and former directors, officers, and employees of NuVasive or any of its
subsidiaries as provided in NuVasive’s and its subsidiaries’ organizational documents, and specified indemnification agreements of NuVasive and its
subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. Globus agreed to cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the organizational documents of NuVasive’s
subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from liabilities of present
and former directors, officers, and employees of NuVasive or its subsidiaries than are currently provided in NuVasive’s and its subsidiaries’ organizational
documents.
From and after the Effective Time, Globus and the Surviving Corporation agreed to, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each person
who is or was a current or former director or officer of NuVasive or any of its subsidiaries against all obligations to pay any threatened, asserted, pending
or completed judgment, damages, settlement, losses, liabilities, or fine or penalty, interest and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative, and whether formal or
 
-157-
Table of Contents
informal, by reason of the fact that the indemnified party is or was an officer or director of NuVasive or its subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at, or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent provided for under applicable law, NuVasive’s organizational documents, the organizational
documents of NuVasive’s subsidiaries and certain indemnification agreements of NuVasive and its subsidiaries.
Under the Merger Agreement, NuVasive may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a tail policy or policies under the current directors’ and officers’
liability insurance policies maintained at such time by NuVasive, and if NuVasive does not obtain such tail policy or policies prior to the Effective Time,
Globus or the Surviving Corporation are required to obtain such policy or policies.
This indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification of Officer and
Directors.”
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to NuVasive’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each of NuVasive’s named
executive officers that is based on or that otherwise relates to the Merger. The Merger-related compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a
non-binding advisory vote of NuVasive’s stockholders, as described above in “NuVasive Proposal 2: Advisory Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related
Compensation for Named Executive Officers.” The table below sets forth, for the purposes of this Merger-related compensation disclosure, the amount
of payments and benefits that each NuVasive named executive officer would receive, using the following assumptions:
 
•
The Effective Time occurs on March 6, 2023 (which is an assumed date solely for the purposes of the calculations in this section);
 
•
Each named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment under his change in control agreement immediately
following the Effective Time (or a termination without cause under each applicable NuVasive RSU Award or NuVasive PRSU Award
agreement immediately following the Effective Time);
 
•
A price per share of NuVasive common stock of $44.67, the average closing price per share over the first five business days following the
first public announcement of the Merger Agreement on February 9, 2023;
 
•
With respect to the tax reimbursement payments under the Plan, assumes that the value of the non-competition covenants to which Messrs.
Barry, Harbaugh and Wolf are subject is equal to 50% of such named executive officer’s total target direct compensation for the restricted
period applicable to such named executive officer, and that all such amounts are deemed to be reasonable compensation for purposes of
determining the amount of the named executive officer’s parachute payments for purposes of Section 280G of the Code.
The calculations in the table do not include amounts that NuVasive’s named executive officers were already vested in as of the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. These amounts also do not reflect compensation actions that may occur after the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus but before the Effective Time, including any additional equity grants.
As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions
described in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set
forth below.
For purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, “single trigger” refers to payments and benefits that arise solely as a result of the completion of
the Merger and “double trigger” refers to payments and benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger and a qualifying
termination of employment.

Cash Severance. As described above in “—Change in Control Agreements,” pursuant to each named executive officer’s change in control
agreement, upon a qualifying termination within two years after a change in control, he will become entitled to a lump sum cash payment equal to
the sum of (i) the applicable severance multiple times the applicable named executive officer’s “annual compensation”, (ii) for Messrs. Barry and
Harbaugh, a pro-rated amount of the highest grant date fair value of any long-term incentive award granted to him in the three years prior to the
year of his separation from service, (iii) the “benefits cash out amount”, and (iv) a pro-rated amount of the greater of (A) the named executive
officer’s target annual bonus amount for the year in which the separation of service occurs or (B) the highest annual bonus paid to the named
executive officer out of the three prior bonuses paid to him prior to his separation from service. The applicable severance multiple is 2.0 for Messrs.
Barry and Harbaugh and 1.5 for Messrs. Sisitsky and Wolf. These cash severance payments are conditioned upon the named executive officer’s
execution and non-revocation of an effective release of claims against NuVasive. The amounts in this column are “double trigger” as they will only
become payable in the event of a qualifying termination of employment at or following the Effective Time.

executive officers will be converted into a corresponding award with respect to Globus Class A Common Stock. Any such converted equity awards
will vest upon a qualifying termination within two years following the Merger (or a termination without cause at any time following the Merger). All

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER",186,192

The following discussion addresses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of shares
of NuVasive Common Stock that exchange their shares of NuVasive Common Stock for shares of Globus Class A Common Stock in the Merger. The
discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as
currently in effect as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) and differing interpretations. Any such
change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Tax
considerations arising under foreign, state or local laws, or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to U.S. federal income tax (such as estate or gift
tax laws), are not addressed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” refers to a beneficial owner of NuVasive Common Stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes:
 
•
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
 
•
a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any of its political subdivisions;
 
•
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more
United States persons (as defined in the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) such trust has made
a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or
 
•
an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its income regardless of its source.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of NuVasive Common Stock that hold their shares of NuVasive Common Stock as a capital asset within
the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion is not a complete description of all of the tax
consequences of the Merger and, in particular, does not address any consequences arising under the alternative minimum tax, unearned income Medicare
contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the
U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith). This
discussion also does not address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation that may be relevant to a particular U.S. holder in light of its personal circumstances
or to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example:
 
•
banks, thrifts, mutual funds, insurance companies or other financial institutions;
 
•
partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities (or investors in partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities);
 
•
tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;
 
•
dealers or brokers in stocks, securities, commodities, or currencies;
 
•
traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting;
 
•
individual retirement or other deferred accounts;
 
•
persons that hold shares of NuVasive Common Stock as part of a straddle, hedge, appreciated financial position, constructive sale,
conversion, integrated or other risk reduction transaction;
 
•
regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts;
 
•
U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 
•
U.S. expatriates;
 
-160-Table of Contents
•
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an “applicable
financial statement”;
 
•
holders who, directly, indirectly or constructively own (or at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger owned)
5% or more of NuVasive Common Stock; and
 
•
stockholders who acquired their shares of NuVasive Common Stock through the exercise of employee stock options, as a restricted stock
award or otherwise as compensation.
If a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of NuVasive Common
Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and partnership.
Partnerships holding shares of NuVasive Common Stock and partners in such partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisors about the tax
consequences of the merger to them.
This discussion is not tax advice and does not purport to be a complete analysis or discussion of all U.S. federal income tax considerations
relating to the Merger. The actual tax consequences of the Merger to you may be complex and may depend on your specific situation and on factors not
within Globus’s or NuVasive’s control. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the Merger in your particular
circumstances, including any federal, state, local or foreign and other tax laws and of changes in those laws.
Globus and NuVasive intend for the Merger to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. NuVasive and Globus must use reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion from external counsel, dated the closing date, to the
effect that the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. That opinion will be based on representation
letters provided by Globus and NuVasive and on any other information as external counsel determines for purposes of rendering such opinion. That
opinion will not be binding on the IRS and neither Globus nor NuVasive has requested or intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a
position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below. In addition, if any of the representations, warranties, covenants or assumptions (including
the assumption that the Merger will be completed in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and as described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus) upon which the opinion described above will be based are inconsistent with the actual facts, or if any condition contained in the
Merger Agreement and affecting the opinion is breached or is waived by any party, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger could be
adversely affected.
Provided the Merger qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders generally are as follows. U.S. holders of NuVasive Common Stock who exchange their shares of NuVasive
Common Stock for shares of Globus Class A Common Stock generally will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except with
respect to cash, if any, received in lieu of fractional shares of Globus Class A Common Stock (taxed in the manner described below). Each U.S. holder’s
aggregate tax basis in the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock received in the Merger (including any fractional share deemed received and sold for
cash, as discussed below) will equal such U.S. holder’s aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares of NuVasive Common Stock exchanged in the Merger.
The holding period of the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock received by a U.S. holder in the Merger (including any fractional share deemed
received and sold for cash, as discussed below) will include such U.S. holder’s holding period for the shares of NuVasive Common Stock exchanged in
the Merger. If a U.S. holder holds different blocks of NuVasive Common Stock (generally, NuVasive Common Stock acquired on different dates or at
different prices), such U.S. holder should consult its tax advisor with respect to the determination of the tax bases and/or holding periods of the particular
shares of Globus Class A Common Stock received in the Merger.
 
-161-
Table of Contents
A U.S. holder of shares of NuVasive Common Stock who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Globus Class A Common Stock generally will
be treated as having received the fractional share of Globus Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and then as having sold that fractional share
for cash. As a result, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the tax
basis in such fractional share (determined as described above). Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital
gain or loss if, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, the holding period for the shares (including the holding period of the NuVasive Common Stock
surrendered therefor) is greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Payments of cash to U.S. holders in lieu of a fractional share of Globus Class A Common Stock in connection with the Merger generally will be
subject to information reporting and may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%). To prevent backup withholding, U.S.
holders of NuVasive Common Stock should (1) furnish the exchange agent for the Merger (or other payor) with a properly completed IRS Form W-9 (or an
applicable substitute or successor form) certifying such U.S. holder’s correct taxpayer identification number and that such U.S. holder is not subject to
backup withholding and otherwise comply with all the applicable backup withholding rules or (2) otherwise establish an applicable exemption from
backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from payments to a U.S. holder of shares of NuVasive Common
Stock under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against such U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided that such U.S.
holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.
The preceding discussion is intended only as an overview of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger and is not tax
advice. It is not a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax considerations that may be important to you. Thus, you are strongly encouraged to
consult your tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences resulting from the Merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability
and effect of federal, state, local and other tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in the tax laws.

This section describes the material differences between the rights of holders of shares of NuVasive Common Stock and the rights of holders of
shares of Globus Class A Common Stock. NuVasive and Globus are each incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and, accordingly, the
rights of NuVasive stockholders and Globus stockholders are both governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. The differences between the rights of
NuVasive stockholders and Globus stockholders primarily result from differences between the organizational documents of NuVasive and Globus. As a
result of the Merger, holders of shares of NuVasive Common Stock that receive shares of Globus Class A Common Stock will become stockholders of
Globus. Accordingly, following the Merger, the rights of NuVasive stockholders who become Globus stockholders will continue to be governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware and will also then be governed by the Globus charter and Globus bylaws.
This section does not include a complete description of all of the differences between the rights of NuVasive stockholders and Globus
stockholders, nor does it include a complete description of the specific rights referred to below. Furthermore, the description of some of the differences in
these rights in this section is not intended to indicate that other differences that may be equally important do not exist. All NuVasive stockholders and
Globus stockholders are urged to read carefully the relevant provisions of the DGCL, as well as each company’s organizational documents. This summary
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the Globus charter, the Globus bylaws, the NuVasive charter and the NuVasive bylaws. For

The NuVasive charter has not opted out of Section 203.
Section 203 of the DGCL generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from
engaging in a business combination with an “interested stockholder” that
acquires more than 15% but less than 85% of the corporation’s outstanding
voting stock for three years following the time that person becomes an
“interested stockholder” (generally defined as a holder who (i) together with
its affiliates and associates, owns or (ii) is an affiliate or associate of the
corporation and, together with that person’s affiliates and associates, has
owned at any time within the previous three years, at least 15% of the
corporation’s outstanding shares), unless prior to the date the person
becomes an interested stockholder, the corporation’s board of directors
approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in
the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or the business
combination is approved by the corporation’s board of directors and by the
affirmative vote of at least two- thirds of the corporation’s outstanding voting
stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder at a meeting of
stockholders (and not by written consent) or other specified exceptions are
met.

provision expressly electing not to be governed by Section 203, but the
Globus charter has not opted out of Section 203.

provide for a greater vote for a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially
all the assets of a corporation than a majority of the shares outstanding. The

Merger has been completed.
Globus stockholders interested in submitting a proposal under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act for inclusion in Globus’s proxy statement for the
Globus 2023 Annual Meeting must have done so by sending such proposal in writing to Globus’s Corporate Secretary at Globus Medical, Inc., Valley
Forge Business Center, 2560 General Armistead Avenue, Audubon, PA 19403, Attention: Legal Department. Under Rule 14a-8, to be considered for

later than January 1, 2023 and complied with applicable SEC rules and regulations. If the date of the Globus 2023 Annual Meeting is moved more than 30
days before or after the anniversary date of Globus’s annual meeting of stockholders in 2022, the deadline for inclusion of proposals in Globus’s proxy
statement will instead be a reasonable time before Globus begins to print and mail its proxy materials for the Globus 2023 Annual Meeting. Any such
proposals will also need to comply with the various provisions of Rule 14a-8, which governs the basis on which such stockholder proposals can be
included or excluded from Globus-sponsored proxy materials.
Globus stockholders interested in submitting a proposal for consideration at the Globus 2023 Annual Meeting (including, but not limited to, the
nomination of persons for election as directors), but not having the proposal included with Globus’s proxy solicitation materials relating to the Globus
2023 Annual Meeting, must give timely notice thereof, along with other specified material, in proper written form to Globus. To be timely, a stockholder’s
notice must be received at the principal executive offices of Globus not less than 50 days and not more than 90 days prior to the date of the annual
meeting.
With respect to the Globus 2023 Annual Meeting, Globus stockholders may nominate a candidate for election to the Globus Board or submit a
proposal of business by sending written notice to the Corporate Secretary at Globus Medical, Inc., Valley Forge Business Center, 2560 General Armistead
Avenue, Audubon, PA 19403, Attention: Legal Department not less than 50 days and not more than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. The
notice to Globus’s Corporate Secretary must contain or be accompanied by the information required by Section 2.14 of the Globus bylaws. In addition, to
comply with the universal proxy rules, stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than Globus’s nominees must
provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than April 3, 2023.
NuVasive
NuVasive will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2023, which is referred to as the “NuVasive 2023 Annual Meeting,” only if the Merger has
not already been completed by the date that is thirteen months after the date NuVasive held its 2022 annual meeting of stockholders.
NuVasive stockholders interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in NuVasive’s proxy materials for the NuVasive 2023 Annual Meeting must
have done so by sending such proposal to NuVasive’s Corporate Secretary at its principal executive offices located at 12101 Airport Way, Broomfield, CO
80021, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Under the SEC’s proxy rules, the deadline for submission of proposals to be included in NuVasive’s proxy materials
for the NuVasive 2023 Annual Meeting was November 30, 2022; provided, however, that, in the event that NuVasive holds the NuVasive 2023 Annual
Meeting more than 30 days before or after the one-year anniversary date of the NuVasive 2022 annual meeting, NuVasive will disclose the new deadline
by which stockholders proposals must be received under Item 5 of its earliest possible Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or, if impracticable, by any means
reasonably calculated to inform stockholders. In addition,
 
-176-Table of Contents
stockholder proposals must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. Such proposals also must comply with SEC
regulations under Rule 14a-8 regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. Accordingly, in order for a
stockholder proposal to have been considered for inclusion in NuVasive’s proxy materials for the NuVasive 2023 Annual Meeting, any such stockholder
proposal must have been received by NuVasive’s Corporate Secretary on or before November 30, 2022 (subject to NuVasive’s adjustment as provided in
the preceding sentence), and must have complied with the procedures and requirements in Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Any stockholder proposal
received after November 30, 2022 (or any NuVasive-directed amended date as provided in the preceding sentence) or that fails to comply with the
procedures and requirements under Rule 14a-8 will not be included in NuVasive’s proxy materials. NuVasive stockholders interested in submitting a
proposal outside of Rule 14a-8 must properly submit such a proposal in accordance with NuVasive’s bylaws.
NuVasive’s bylaws state the procedures for a stockholder to bring a stockholder proposal or nominate an individual to serve as a director on the
NuVasive Board. NuVasive’s bylaws provide that advance notice of a stockholder’s proposal or nomination of an individual to serve as a director must be
delivered to the Secretary of NuVasive at NuVasive’s principal executive offices not earlier than the 120th day prior to the anniversary of the previous
year’s annual meeting of stockholders (i.e., January 11, 2023), nor later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the anniversary of the previous
year’s annual meeting of stockholders (i.e., February 10, 2023). This time period for providing such advance notice has expired. However, the NuVasive
bylaws also provide that, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days from the previous year’s annual meeting as
specified in NuVasive’s notice of meeting, this advance notice must be given not earlier than the 120th day, nor later than the close of business on the
later of the 90th day, prior to the date of such annual meeting, or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days
prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made
by NuVasive. In addition to meeting the advance notice provisions mentioned above, the stockholder in its notice must provide the information required
by NuVasive’s bylaws to bring a stockholder proposal or nominate an individual to serve as a director of the NuVasive Board. A copy of NuVasive’s
bylaws may be obtained by written request to NuVasive’s Corporate Secretary at its principal executive offices located at 12101 Airport Way, Broomfield,
CO 80021. In addition, to comply with the universal proxy rules, stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than

NUVASIVE INC_20230328_DEFM14A_20755850_4630097.Pdf,HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS,"HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and notices with respect to
two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This
process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” provides cost savings for companies.
Globus and NuVasive have each previously adopted householding for stockholders of record. As a result, stockholders with the same address and
last name may receive only one copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus from Globus or NuVasive, as applicable. Registered Globus stockholders or
NuVasive stockholders (those who hold shares directly in their name with Globus’s or NuVasive’s transfer agent) may opt out of householding and
receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by sending a written request to Globus or NuVasive, as applicable, at the
address below.
Some brokers also household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless
contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding
materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer
wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of
these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.
Requests for additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus should be directed to, as applicable: Globus Medical, Inc., Valley Forge
Business Center, 2560 General Armistead Avenue, Audubon, PA 19403, Attention: Legal Department; or NuVasive, Inc., 7475 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego,

numbered representation, warranty or covenant of the Company or Parent, as applicable, in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with

Company Common Stock subject to the applicable Company PRSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 3.02(b), the number of shares of Company

Effective Time or (ii) in the case of a Company PRSU Award granted in 2022, 100% of the target number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to

Stock for delivery with respect to all Exchanged RSUs, Exchanged PRSUs and Converted PRSUs. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall file
and cause to be effective one or more registration statements under the Securities Act on Form S-8, Form S-3, Form S-1 or other appropriate form under
the Securities Act, relating to shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable with respect to all Exchanged RSUs, Exchanged PRSUs and Converted
PRSUs, and Parent shall cause such registration statements to remain in effect for so long as such Exchanged RSUs, Exchanged PRSUs and Converted
PRSUs remain outstanding.
Section 3.03. Closing of the Company Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, (a) (i) each certificate formerly representing any share of Company
Common Stock (each a “Certificate”) and (ii) each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock (each, a “Book-Entry Share”) shall cease to be
outstanding and in either case shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 3.01(a) and all holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as Company Stockholders; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
 
A-22
Table of Contents
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time, a valid Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, to the Surviving Corporation or
to Parent, such Certificate shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as provided in this Article III.
Section 3.04. Exchange Fund; Exchange of Certificates; Cancellation of Book-Entry Positions.
(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall select a reputable bank, transfer agent or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act
as exchange agent in the Merger (the “Exchange Agent”) for the payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to an exchange
agent agreement (the “Exchange Agent Agreement”)reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the Company Stockholders, for exchange in accordance with this Article III through the Exchange
Agent, on behalf of itself, (i) the maximum number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.01(a) (to be represented by book-entry shares of Parent Class A Common Stock); and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.05(a) (the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Section 3.04(a) being referred to herein collectively as the “Exchange Fund”).
(b) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the
Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in
any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, upon surrender of shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary
surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock otherwise payable to such holder of
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 3.05(a).
(c) With respect to Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC (each, a “Non-DTC Book-Entry Share”), Parent shall instruct, and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause, the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver to each holder of record of any Non-DTC Book-Entry Share, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, the applicable Merger Consideration
and a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.06) of any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock otherwise payable to such holder of Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 3.05(a) and each Non-DTC Book-Entry Share
shall be promptly cancelled by the Exchange Agent.
(d) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the record holders of Certificates (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, as provided in
Section 3.01(a). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive (A) in exchange a
certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing the number of whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.01(a) and (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.05(a). Any such Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.04(d), each
Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Article III. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, any
portion of the Merger Consideration may be issued or paid (in cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.05(a)) to a Person other than the
Person in whose name such Certificate so surrendered is
 
A-23
Table of Contents
registered if such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such issuances and/or payments
pays any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such issuance and/or payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of such shares of Company Common Stock or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance and/or payment of the
Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such
sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate.
(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed as of the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date shall be
delivered to Parent upon its request, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with Section 3.04(d) or any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not cashed any check payable to them in respect of any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable to such holders pursuant to Section 3.05(a) shall thereafter look only to Parent
for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock), subject to
applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law.
(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any current or former
Company Stockholder or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration, properly delivered to any public official in compliance with any
applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered or any check payable in respect of any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable to such holders pursuant to Section 3.05(a) shall not have been cashed prior to
five (5) years after the Closing Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any portion of the Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Body), any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining in the Exchange Fund shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Section 3.05. No Fractional Shares; Certain Calculations; No Appraisal Rights.
(a) No fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, no dividends or distributions of
Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests, no certificates or book-entry positions for any such fractional shares shall be issued, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a Parent Stockholder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Class A Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the aggregate net cash
proceeds as determined below and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is such fractional part of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock, and the
denominator is the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock constituting a portion of the Exchange Fund as represents the aggregate of all
fractional entitlements of all holders of Company Common Stock. As promptly as possible following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall sell at
then-prevailing prices on the NYSE such number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock constituting a portion of the Exchange Fund as represents
the aggregate of all fractional entitlements of all holders of Company Common Stock, with the cash proceeds (net of all commissions, transfer taxes and
other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sales) of such sales to be used by the Exchange Agent
to fund the foregoing payments in lieu of fractional shares. The Parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to this Article III was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock.
 
A-24
Table of Contents
(b) All calculations performed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be calculated to four decimal places (e.g. 0.0001), where
applicable.
(c) In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to the Company Stockholders in connection with the
Merger.
Section 3.06. Withholding. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and any other applicable
withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold such amounts as are required under applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from the
amounts payable (including shares of Parent Class A Common Stock deliverable) under this Agreement in accordance with the Code and any other
applicable Law. Any such withheld or deducted amounts as are timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body shall be treated as though such
amount had been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was determined to be necessary.
Section 3.07. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the
number of shares Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time, in either case, as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the consideration paid in
accordance with this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; provided, that nothing in this Section 3.07 shall be construed to
permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
Section 3.08. Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent or the Company to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of Parent shall be further authorized to take such action. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation also shall take such further actions as may be necessary or desirable to ensure that the Exchange Agent sends out the letters of transmittal
to the Company Stockholders or otherwise issues evidence of shares in book-entry form representing shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and
otherwise fulfils the Exchange Agent’s obligations in accordance with Section 3.04.
ARTICLE IV

lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to hold such authorizations, licenses
and Permits would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or authorized to do business
and is in good standing in every jurisdiction (to the extent such concept exists in such jurisdiction) in which its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of business as now conducted requires it to qualify, except where the failure to be so

of the Company (the “Company Organizational Documents”), each as in effect as of the date hereof, have been heretofore made available to Parent.
Section 4.02. Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this

affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock entitled to vote thereon in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger (the “Company Stockholder Approval”). The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of, the Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii) approved and deemed advisable the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the

recommend that the Company Stockholders approve the Contemplated Transactions and adopt this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, except
as may be expressly permitted by Section 7.04, such approvals, determinations, declarations, resolutions and directions are valid and have not been
amended or withdrawn. No Takeover Law applies to this Agreement, any Company Transaction Document or the Contemplated Transactions. Except for
the Company Stockholder Approval, no other corporate proceeding, including pursuant to the Laws of the State of Delaware or the listing standards of
the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”), on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is necessary to authorize or adopt this
Agreement and each other Company Transaction Document, or to consummate the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions (except for the filing of
the appropriate merger documents, the Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement as required by applicable Law). The Company has duly executed
and delivered this Agreement and each other Company Transaction Document, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent,
Merger Sub and any other counterparty thereto, this Agreement and each other Company Transaction Document constitute its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES
Section 7.01. Investigation.
(a) Upon Parent’s reasonable advance request to the Company, for the purposes of facilitating the Contemplated Transaction or preparing
for the post-Closing integration of the Company and Parent, the Company shall afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours during the Pre-Closing Period to the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ personnel and properties, Contracts, commitments, books and
records and any report, schedule or other documents filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Law and with such additional
financial, operating and other data and information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however,
that such access shall be in a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to afford such access to Parent and its Representatives if, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, it would cause a loss of privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would constitute a violation of any
applicable Law or a breach of any Contract to which it is a party, would result in the disclosure of any valuations of the Company or Parent in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions or portions of the minutes of the meetings of the Company Board or any committee thereof (including any
presentations or other materials prepared by or for the Company Board or any committee thereof) where the Company Board or such committee, as
applicable, discussed the Contemplated Transactions or any similar transaction between the Company and any other Person, would result in the
disclosure of any information in connection with any litigation or similar dispute between the Parties, would expose the Company to violations of Privacy
Laws, or would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets; provided, in each case, that the Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to find
an alternative way to provide the access or information contemplated by this Section 7.01(a) to Parent and its Representatives, as applicable, that does
not cause such loss, constitute such violation or breach or result in such disclosure or exposure, and provided, further that in the event the Company
restricts access or information pursuant to the foregoing exceptions, the Company shall provide written notice of the reason for such restriction.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to Section 7.01(c) and Section 7.01(f), promptly following the date
hereof, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide Parent with full and complete copies of each Material Contract. Nothing in this Section
7.01(a) shall be construed so as to limit Parent’s ability to exercise any of its rights or remedies pursuant to this Agreement.
(b) Upon the Company’s reasonable advance request to Parent, for the purposes of facilitating the Contemplated Transaction or preparing
for the post-Closing integration of the Company and Parent, Parent shall afford to the Company and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours during the Pre-Closing Period to Parent’s and its Subsidiaries’ personnel and properties, Contracts, commitments, books and records and
any report, schedule or other documents filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Law and with such additional financial,
operating and other data and information regarding Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the Company may reasonably request, provided, however, that such
access shall be in a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to afford such access to the Company and its Representatives if, in the reasonable
judgment of Parent, it would cause a loss of privilege to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, would constitute a violation of any applicable Law or a breach
of any Contract to which it is a party, would result in the disclosure of any valuations of the Company or Parent in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions or portions of the minutes of the meetings of the Parent Board or any committee thereof (including any presentations or other materials
prepared by or for the Parent Board or any committee thereof) where the Parent Board or such committee, as applicable, discussed the Contemplated
Transactions or any similar transaction between Parent and any other Person, would result in the disclosure of any information in connection with any
litigation or similar dispute between the Parties, would expose Parent to violations of Privacy Laws, or would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets;
provided, in each case, that Parent has used commercially reasonable efforts to find an alternative way to provide the access or information
 
A-56
Table of Contents
contemplated by this Section 7.01(b) to the Company and its Representatives, as applicable, that does not cause such loss, constitute such violation or
breach or result in such disclosure or exposure, and provided, further, that, in the event Parent restricts access or information pursuant to the foregoing
exceptions, Parent shall provide written notice of the reason for such restriction. Nothing in this Section 7.01(b) shall be construed so as to limit the
Company’s ability to exercise any of its rights or remedies pursuant to this Agreement.
(c) Disclosure of any information pursuant to this Section 7.01 or Section 7.07 may be limited to external counsel for Parent or the Company,
as applicable, to the extent the disclosing Party determines doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust
Laws. Disclosure of any information pursuant to this Section 7.01 or Section 7.07 shall be subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense
agreement the parties may mutually determine to enter into.  
(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of
any occurrence of a Parent Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, provided that the failure to make any such
notification shall have not relieve or otherwise have any effect on the obligations of any Party to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.01, any physical access may be limited by the disclosing Party to the extent
the disclosing Party determines in good faith that such limitation is necessary in light of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures, including if providing
such access would reasonably be expected to pose a material risk to the general health and safety of employees of the disclosing Party or the applicable
Subsidiary thereof. Nothing herein shall authorize any Party or its Representatives to undertake any environmental testing or sampling at any of the
properties owned, operated or leased by the other Party or its Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result from requests for access.
(f) The Parties hereby agree that all information provided to them or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, including the information provided pursuant to Section 7.01(a), shall be deemed to be Confidential
Information, as such term is defined in, and shall be treated in accordance with, that certain confidentiality letter agreement between Parent and the
Company dated as of October 22, 2021 (as it may be amended, the “Confidentiality Agreement”) and, to the extent applicable, that certain Clean Team
Agreement between Parent and the Company dated as of January 6, 2023 (as it may be amended, the “Clean Team Agreement”) and shall be used solely
to effectuate the Contemplated Transactions, including with respect to planning for integration, or exercising any of the Parties’ rights or remedies under
the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company agrees that it will not use any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.01 for any competitive purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions or the
exercise of either Party’s rights or remedies under this Agreement and preparation for the post-Closing integration of the Company and Parent.
Section 7.02. Registration Statement; Proxy Statement.
(a) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, and in any event within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, (i) Parent
and the Company shall jointly prepare a joint proxy statement (the “Joint Proxy Statement”) in preliminary form, which shall, subject to Section 7.04 and

and file with the SEC (x) a registration statement on Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be included and (y) a prospectus relating to the

mailed to the Company Stockholders or when the Registration Statement becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in such efforts, to
have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, including the Merger. In furtherance thereof, Parent and the
Company will work together in good faith, including with each Party’s Representatives (including by providing reasonable access to relevant data,
schedules and work papers), to prepare financial statements, financial information and such other information as required to be included in the
Registration Statement.
(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other and provide, and require its Representatives to provide the
other party and its Representatives, with all true, correct and complete information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is required by

and the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective independent accounting firms to deliver consent letters regarding the
inclusion of their opinions with respect to the Company’s or Parent’s, as applicable, financial statements that are included in the Registration Statement,
which such consent letter shall be customary in scope and substance for consent letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.
(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to mail the Joint Proxy Statement to its respective
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws and other applicable Laws in connection with the issuance of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, and each Party shall furnish all information concerning the Company, Parent and the
holders of capital stock of the Company and Parent, as applicable, as may be reasonably requested by another Party in connection with any such action
and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
material correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement may be made by Parent, or with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement may be made by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, without providing the Company (in the case of Parent) or Parent
(in the case of the Company) a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation shall not apply
with respect to the Company Annual Meeting Portion, the Parent Annual Meeting Portion and documents filed by a party that are incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement; and provided, further, that this approval right shall not apply with respect to information
relating to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with this Agreement. Parent
shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable
in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. Each of Parent and the Company shall advise the other,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for the amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to either the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
 
A-58

information shall be promptly filed with the SEC, after the other Party has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to either the Parent Stockholders or the Company Stockholders, as applicable.
Section 7.03. Stockholders’ Meetings.
(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents to duly
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act, to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval (the “Company Stockholders’ Meeting”). Subject to Section
7.04, the Company will, through the Company Board, recommend that the Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of the Company Stockholders required by the Company Organizational Documents, the rules of NASDAQ or
applicable Law to obtain such approvals. The Company shall not (i) submit at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting any matter for approval of the
Company Stockholders other than those required for the Company Stockholder Approval (and other than matters of procedure and matters required by or
advisable under applicable Law to be voted on by the Company Stockholders in connection therewith) or (ii) hold a stockholder meeting for any purpose
prior to the occurrence of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting; provided that the Company may (x) combine its annual meeting of stockholders with the
Company Stockholders’ Meeting and submit such additional matters at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting as it is required to present or has
customarily presented at its prior annual meetings (the portion, if any, of the Joint Proxy Statement relating solely to the Company’s annual meeting, the
“Company Annual Meeting Portion”) or (y) if the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the date that is twenty five (25) Business Days
before the date that is thirteen (13) months after the date the Company held its annual meeting of stockholders in 2022, hold its annual meeting of
stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting; provided, further, however, that subject to Section 7.03(c), in no event shall the Company
Stockholders’ Meeting be held on a date that is more than 30 days following the date on which the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. The Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub.
(b) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and Parent’s Organizational Documents to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Parent Stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under
the Securities Act, to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval (the “Parent Stockholders’ Meeting”). Subject to Section 7.06, Parent will, through the
Parent Board, recommend that the Parent Stockholders approve the proposal to issue the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the Parent Stockholders proxies in favor of the issuance of the
aggregate Merger Consideration and to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the Parent Stockholders required by
Parent’s Organizational Documents, the rules of NYSE or applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Parent shall not (i) submit at the Parent Stockholders’
Meeting any matter for approval of Parent Stockholders other than those required for the Parent Stockholder Approval (and other than matters of
procedure and matters required by or advisable under applicable Law to be voted on by the Parent Stockholders in connection therewith) or (ii) hold a
stockholder meeting for any purpose prior to the occurrence of the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting; provided that Parent may (x) combine its annual
meeting of stockholders with the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting and submit such additional matters at the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting as it is required to
present or has customarily presented at its prior annual meetings (the portion, if any, of the Joint Proxy Statement relating solely to Parent’s annual
meeting, the “Parent Annual Meeting Portion”) or (y) if the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the date that is twenty five (25) Business
Days before the date that is thirteen (13) months after the date Parent held its annual meeting of stockholders in 2022; provided, further, however, that
subject to Section 7.03(c), in no event shall the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting be held on a date that is more than 30 days following the date on which the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.

(c) The Company and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to schedule and hold the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and
the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting, as applicable, on the same date and as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act; provided, that the Company or Parent, as applicable, may, after reasonable consultation with the Company or Parent, as
applicable, postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholders’ Meeting or the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting, as applicable, and, if applicable, set a
new record date for such meeting, (i) if required by Law, (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes present in person or by proxy at such meeting to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval, as applicable, and such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
order to obtain the requisite number of affirmative votes in person or by proxy as of such later date, or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by the Company Stockholders or the Parent Stockholders, as applicable, prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting or the Parent
Stockholders’ Meeting, as applicable; provided, however, that neither the Company Stockholders’ Meeting nor the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting shall be
postponed or adjourned for more than ten (10) Business Days in the aggregate from the originally scheduled date of such meeting without the prior
written consent of the other Party or on any occasion to a date after the date that is ten (10) Business Days before the End Date (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Section 7.04. Non-Solicitation by Company; Company Board Recommendation.
(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its directors and Subsidiaries not to, and shall instruct its and their respective Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, seek or solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) or take
any other action that is reasonably expected to promote, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate or engage in discussions (except to notify a Person that
makes an inquiry or offer with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal of the existence of the provisions of this Section 7.04 or to clarify whether any
such inquiry, offer or proposal constitutes a Company Acquisition Proposal) or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data relating
to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person
that has made or could reasonably be expected to make, or in connection with, a Company Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreement,
including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement,
with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to this Section 7.04).
The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cause to be terminated
any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with or involving any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates ) conducted heretofore by
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or any of its or their respective Representatives, with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection therewith, the Company shall immediately discontinue access by
any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) to any data room (virtual or otherwise) established by the Company or its Representatives for such
purpose. Within two (2) Business Days from the date hereof, the Company shall request the return or destruction of all confidential, non-public
information provided to Third Parties that have entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or who have
otherwise been provided with confidential, non-public information since January 1, 2022 relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, until obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board may take any
actions described in clause (ii) of this Section 7.04(a) with respect to Third Party if, (x) the Company receives a written Company Acquisition Proposal
from such Third Party (and such Company Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated in violation of
this Section 7.04(a)) and (y) such proposal constitutes, or the Company Board determines in good faith after
 
A-60
Table of Contents
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such proposal is or could reasonably expected to lead to, a Company Superior
Proposal; provided, that the Company may deliver non-public information to such Third Party pursuant to this sentence only pursuant to an Acceptable
Company Confidentiality Agreement with respect to the Company. Nothing contained in this Section 7.04 shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rules 14d-9,
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure if the Company Board has determined in
good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company Stockholders; provided, that this sentence shall not permit the Company Board to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, except to the extent permitted by Section 7.04(b) or Section 7.04(c).
(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof may directly or indirectly (i) withhold, withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee of the Merger; (ii) propose publicly to recommend,
adopt or approve any Company Acquisition Proposal; (iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement; or (iv) fail to
reaffirm or re-publish the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of being requested by Parent to do so or, if earlier, not later
than two (2) Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (any action described in this sentence being referred to as a “Company
Adverse Recommendation Change”); provided, that such ten (10) Business Day period shall be extended for an additional five (5) Business Days
following any material modification to any Company Acquisition Proposal occurring after the receipt of Parent’s written request, and Parent shall be
entitled to make such a written request for reaffirmation or republication only once for each Company Acquisition Proposal. A “stop, look and listen”
disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act in connection with a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change. A change of the Company Board Recommendation to “neutral” is a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and subject to the Company’s compliance in all
material respects with the provisions of Section 7.03 and this Section 7.04, in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has
determined in its reasonable discretion is a Company Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn and did not result from a breach of Section 7.04(a),
the Company Board may make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(c)(ii); provided,
however, that the Company may not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(c)(ii) in
response to a Company Superior Proposal (x) until four (4) Business Days after the Company provides written notice to Parent advising Parent that the
Company Board has received a Company Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal,
identifying the Person or group making such Company Superior Proposal and including copies of all documents pertaining to such Company Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice
hereunder shall require a new notice as provided herein, but with respect to any such subsequent notices references to a “four (4) Business Day period”
shall be deemed references to a “two (2) Business Day period”); (y) if during such four (4) or two (2) Business Day period (the “Company Notice
Period”), Parent proposes any alternative transaction in writing (including any modifications to the terms of this Agreement), unless the Company Board
determines in good faith, after good faith negotiations between the Company and Parent (if such negotiations are requested by Parent) during such four
(4) or two (2) Business Day Company Notice Period (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisor and taking into
account all financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions of such alternative transaction proposal and expected timing of consummation and the
relative risks of non-consummation of the alternative transaction proposal and the Company Superior Proposal) that such alternative transaction
proposed by Parent in writing is not at least as favorable to the Company and the Company Stockholders as the Company Superior Proposal and (z)
unless the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that the failure to make a
Company
 
A-61
Table of Contents
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that (i) the Company shall first notify Parent in
writing at least four (4) Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed
description of the reasons therefor, (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with Parent
and its Representatives during such four (4) Business Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement, and (iii) the Company Board shall not effect any Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless, after the four (4) Business Day period
described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into
account any written proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement during such four Business Day period, that the failure to take such action
would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(d) The Parties agree that in addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 7.04, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours, the Company shall advise Parent in writing of any request for information or any Company
Acquisition Proposal received from any Person and the material terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal, and the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements, received by the Company in connection
with any of the foregoing and the identity of the Person or group making any such request, Company Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom any
discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it shall substantially concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning itself or its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person or group in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal which was not
previously provided to Parent. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status of any Company
Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of the parties and price involved and any changes to any material terms and conditions thereof).
Section 7.05. Non Solicitation by Parent. Parent shall not, and shall cause its directors and Subsidiaries not to, and shall instruct its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, seek or solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing
non-public information) or take any other action that is reasonably expected to promote, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or submission
of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate or engage in discussions
(except to notify a Person that makes an inquiry or offer with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal of the existence of the provisions of this Section
7.05 or to clarify whether any such inquiry, offer or proposal constitutes a Parent Acquisition Proposal) or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public
information or data relating to, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
any Person that has made or could reasonably be expected to make, or in connection with, a Parent Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreement,
including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement,
with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Parent Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to this Section 7.05). Parent
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cause to be terminated any solicitation,
encouragement, discussion or negotiation with or involving any Person (other than the Company and its Affiliates) conducted heretofore by Parent or
any Subsidiary thereof or any of its or their respective Representatives, with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or which could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection therewith, Parent shall immediately discontinue access by any Person (other than
Company and its Affiliates) to any data room (virtual or otherwise) established by Parent or its Representatives for such purpose. Within two (2)
Business Days from the date hereof, Parent shall request the return or destruction of all confidential, non-public information provided to Third Parties
that
 
A-62
Table of Contents
have entered into confidentiality agreements with Parent or any Subsidiary thereof or who have otherwise been provided with confidential, non-public
information since January 1, 2022 relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, until obtaining
the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent and the Parent Board may take any actions described in clause (ii) of this Section 7.05 with respect to Third Party
if (x) Parent receives a written Parent Acquisition Proposal from such Third Party (and such Parent Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, sought,
solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated in violation of this Section 7.05) and (y) such proposal constitutes, or the Parent Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such proposal is or could reasonably expected to lead to, a Parent
Superior Proposal; provided, that Parent may deliver non-public information to such Third Party pursuant to this sentence only pursuant to an
Acceptable Parent Confidentiality Agreement with respect to Parent. Nothing contained in this Section 7.05 shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from
(i) taking and disclosing to the Parent Stockholders a position with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure if the Parent Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Parent
Stockholders; provided, that this sentence shall not permit the Parent Board to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, except to the extent
permitted by Section 7.06(a).
Section 7.06. Parent Board Recommendation.
(a) Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof may directly or indirectly (a) withhold, withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to the Company) or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Company), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Parent Board or any such committee of the Merger, (b) propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (c) fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, or (d) fail to reaffirm or re-
publish the Parent Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of being requested by the Company to do so or, if earlier, not later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting (any action described in this sentence being referred to as a “Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change”), provided, that such ten (10) Business Day period shall be extended for an additional five (5) Business Days following any material modification
to any Parent Acquisition Proposal occurring after the receipt of the Company’s written request, and the Company shall be entitled to make such a written
request for reaffirmation or republication only once for each Parent Acquisition Proposal. A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act in connection with a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. A
change of the Parent Board Recommendation to “neutral” is a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior
to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, and subject to Parent compliance in all material respects with the provisions of Section 7.03, Section 7.05
and this Section 7.06, in response to a Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Parent Board has determined in its reasonable discretion is a Parent Superior
Proposal that has not been withdrawn and did not result from a breach of Section 7.05, the Parent Board may make such a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(iii); provided, however, that Parent may not make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(iii) in response to a Parent Superior Proposal (x) until four (4) Business
Days after Parent provides written notice to the Company advising the Company that the Parent Board has received a Parent Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Parent Superior Proposal, identifying the Person or group making such Parent Superior Proposal and
including copies of all documents pertaining to such Parent Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other
material terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice as provided herein, but with respect to any
such subsequent notices references to a “four (4) Business Day period” shall be deemed references to a “two (2) Business Day period”); (y) if during
such four (4) or two (2) Business Day period (the “Parent Notice Period”), the Company proposes any alternative transaction in writing (including any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement), unless the Parent Board determines in good faith, after good faith negotiations between Parent and the
Company (if such negotiations are requested by
 
A-63

the Company) during such four (4) or two (2) Business Day Parent Notice Period (after consultation with Parent’s outside legal counsel and financial
advisor and taking into account all financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions of such alternative transaction proposal and expected timing of
consummation and the relative risks of non-consummation of the alternative transaction proposal and the Parent Superior Proposal) that such alternative
transaction proposed by the Company in writing is not at least as favorable to Parent and the Parent Stockholders as the Parent Superior Proposal and (z)
unless the Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that the failure to make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Parent Stockholders under applicable Law.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board may effect a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that (i) Parent shall first notify the Company in writing at least
four (4) Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the
reasons therefor, (ii) if requested by the Company, Parent shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with the Company and its
Representatives during such four (4) Business Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this
Agreement, and (iii) the Parent Board shall not effect any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless, after the four (4) Business Day period
described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account
any written proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement during such four Business Day period, that the failure to take such action
would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(c) The Parties agree that in addition to the other obligations of Parent set forth in Section 7.05 and this Section 7.06, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours, Parent shall advise the Company in writing of any request for information
or any Parent Acquisition Proposal received from any Person and the material terms and conditions of such Parent Acquisition Proposal, and Parent shall
promptly provide to the Company copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements received by the Company in
connection with any of the foregoing and the identity of the Person or group making any such request, Parent Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with
whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place. Parent agrees that it shall substantially concurrently provide to the Company any non-public
information concerning itself or its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person or group in connection with any Parent Acquisition Proposal which was
not previously provided to the Company. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status of any Parent
Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of the parties and price involved and any changes to any material terms and conditions thereof).
Section 7.07. Regulatory Approvals; Additional Agreements; Performance of Merger Sub.
(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days, the Company
and Parent each shall file, or shall cause to be filed, with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
Notification and Report Forms relating to the Merger and any other Contemplated Transaction. The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, (i) use reasonable best efforts to file, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, all other filings,
notifications, or other documents required to be filed with or as requested by any Governmental Body pursuant to any Antitrust Law with respect to the
Merger and any other Contemplated Transaction, and (ii) cooperate with the other Party in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any
other filings or notifications or other Consents required to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with the Merger
and any other Contemplated Transaction.
(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and to cause their respective directors, executive officers and other Representatives to take, all actions, to file, or
cause to be filed, all documents and to
 
A-64

do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger and any other Contemplated Transaction as soon as reasonably practicable, including (i) obtaining all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, Consents, clearances, decisions, declarations, approvals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods
from Governmental Bodies and making all necessary registrations and filings and taking all steps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain any such
Consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a waiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Body in connection with any applicable Law; (ii) obtaining all necessary Consents, authorizations, approvals or
waivers from third parties; (iii) defending any lawsuit or other legal proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Body or
third party challenging this Agreement or seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit or make illegal consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transaction and contesting any Order that enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal consummation of the Merger or any of the
other Contemplated Transaction, including, resolving any objections of or challenge made by any Governmental Body or third party to the Merger or any
other Contemplated Transaction under any Antitrust Law; (iv) refraining from taking any other action that would reasonably be expected to impede,
interfere with, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger; and (v) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and any other Contemplated Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and in furtherance of
and consistent with Parent’s reasonable best efforts under this Section 7.07, Parent shall, and shall cause to be taken, all actions and shall do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that is asserted by any Governmental
Body, to obtain the consent or cooperation of any other Person, and to permit and cause the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(e),
and Section 8.01(d), in each of the foregoing cases, to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the End
Date, including (i) negotiating, making proposals with respect to, committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
lease, license, divestiture or disposition of any assets, equity securities, rights, product lines, or businesses of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement, (iv) creating any relationship, contractual right or obligation of the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and
(vi) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions with respect to the businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or that would impose any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct their respective
businesses or own such assets or limit or impair the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a “Remedy Action”); provided, however, (A) Parent shall not be required to propose, commit to, effect or agree to, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate or other disposition of any business, asset, property or product

combination (whether structured as a merger, business combination, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction) or the acquisition of any assets,
licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of any Person that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the receipt of the
Required Regulatory Approval or to otherwise prevent, materially delay, impede or impair the consummation of the Merger by the End Date.
Section 7.08. Employment and Labor Matters.
(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date that is six (6) months following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide each Company Employee with the following: (i) annual base salary or wages, as applicable, that are
no less than the annual base salary or wages, as applicable, in effect for each such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target
cash incentive opportunities that are no less than the target cash incentive opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, (iii) target
long-term incentive opportunities that are no less than the target long-term incentive opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of Parent,
and (iv) employee benefits and other compensation (other than severance or termination benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the

addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date that is six (6) months thereafter, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, provide each Company Employee with severance and termination benefits as set forth on Section 7.08(a) of the Company Disclosure

such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Plan, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide
each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance and deductibles paid under a Company Plan that

A-66
Table of Contents
Plan, to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Plan with respect to such plan year, in satisfying any applicable
deductible, co-payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plan that provides health care benefits, and (iii) recognize all
service of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into
account under the analogous Company Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent
it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan, or (C) for purposes of any
benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.
(c) If requested by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (a “Company 401(k) Plan”) or any other Company Plan (other than the Executive
Severance Plan) to be terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. If
Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan or any other Company Plan (other than the Executive Severance Plan) be terminated, (i) the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to Parent’s reasonable
prior review and comment), and (ii) if applicable, Parent shall cause the Company Employees to be eligible to participate, as soon as administratively
practicable after the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (a “Parent 401(k) Plan”). The Parties shall
take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to any Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit the Company
Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning
of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof. Furthermore, if reasonably requested by
Parent, the Company shall take preparatory actions in connection with proposed terminations of other Company Plans (other than the Executive
Severance Plan) pursuant to integration planning actions undertaken by the Parties. Without limitation of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the
Company shall take the actions described on Section 7.08(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(d) All material resolutions, notices and other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this Section
7.08 shall be subject to Parent’s reasonable prior review and comment. Prior to making any material, broad-based, written communications to the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the Merger or the other
Contemplated Transactions, each Party shall provide the other Party with a copy of the intended communication, such Party shall have a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication.
(e) With respect to the Company ESPP, the Company shall ensure that (i) no new offering periods under the Company ESPP will commence
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, (ii) there will be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions permitted to
be made by the participants under the Company ESPP during the current offering period, except those made in accordance with payroll deduction
elections that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iii) no individuals shall commence participation in the Company ESPP during the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date. To the extent applicable, no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, in the case of any
outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP, any then-current offering period under the Company ESPP shall end and each participant’s
accumulated payroll deductions shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. Shares
of Company Common Stock held in participants’ Company ESPP account balances immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be treated the same as all
other shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.01. The Company shall ensure that the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately
prior to the Effective Time contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. As promptly as possible following the purchase of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the foregoing, the Company shall return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account
under the Company ESPP after such purchase.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.08, express or implied (i) shall be deemed to be an amendment to any particular Company Plan or
other particular employee benefit plan, (ii) shall be construed to require Company, or any of its Subsidiaries to establish, amend, assume, maintain or
modify any particular employee benefit plan (including any Plan), program, agreement or arrangement or prohibit Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries from amending, modifying or terminating any particular employee benefit plan (including any Plan), program, agreement or

Subsidiaries from terminating the employment of any employee at any time.
Section 7.09. Indemnification of Officers and Directors.
(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the present and former directors, officers, and employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Organizational Documents or the Organizational Documents of the Company’s Subsidiaries, and indemnification
agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof and set forth on Section 7.09(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the organizational documents of the Company’s Subsidiaries to contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from liabilities of present and former directors,
officers, and employees of Company and/or its Subsidiaries than are currently provided in the Company Organizational Documents and the organizational
documents of the Company’s Subsidiaries, which provisions may not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to such matters and (ii) six (6)
years from the Effective Time, and, in the event that any Action is pending or asserted or made during such period, until the disposition of any such
Action, unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable Law.
(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any agreement or Company Plan, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is or was a current or former
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or was serving, at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, as a director, trustee or officer of any other entity or any Company Plan (each, together with such person’s heirs, successors, or legal
representatives, an “Indemnified Party”), against all obligations to pay any threatened, asserted, pending or completed judgment, damages, settlement,
losses, liabilities, or fine or penalty, interest and reasonable expenses (including legal expenses and other reasonable expenses that may be incurred by
any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.09) incurred in connection with any
Action (such amounts, the “Claim Expenses,” and such claims made against any Indemnified Party, a “D&O Claim”), whether civil, criminal,
administrative, arbitrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal, by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or an officer, trustee or director of another entity or Company Plan if such service was at the request of the Company,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Time (including with respect to any acts, facts, events or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the consummation of any other Contemplated Transactions, including the consideration and approval
thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith), to the fullest extent provided for under applicable Law, the Company Organizational
Documents, the organizational documents of the Company’s Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a tail policy or
policies under the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained at such time by the Company, which tail policy or policies (i) will
be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to
 
A-68
Table of Contents
claims arising from acts, errors or omissions that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time and (ii) will provide coverage and amounts that are at
least as protective to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by such existing policies and contain other terms and conditions and contain
other terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered individuals as the terms and conditions in such existing policies; provided, that the
total annual premium for such tail policy or policies shall not be in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the Effective
Time (the “Maximum Premium”). In the event the Company does not obtain such tail policy or policies prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain such tail policy or policies, provided that the total annual premium for such tail policy or policies shall not be in excess of the
Maximum Premium; and provided, further, that if such tail policy or policies cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual
premiums in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained
by paying an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Parent shall cause such tail policy or policies (whether obtained by the Company, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation) to be maintained in full force and effect for their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation.
(d) This Section 7.09 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to benefit, and is enforceable by, any Indemnified Party.
The indemnification and advancement provided for in this Section 7.09 is not exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnified Party is entitled
whether pursuant to Law, Contract, or otherwise. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting from such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers all or majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall make
proper provision such that the respective successors and assigns of Parent and Surviving Corporation assume the applicable obligations set forth in this
Section 7.09.
(e) Each of the Indemnified Parties or other Persons who are beneficiaries under the “tail” policy referred to in this Section 7.09 (and, after
the death of any of the foregoing Persons, such Person’s heirs, successors, executors, administrators and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.09, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 7.09 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.
Section 7.10. Public Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release, and thereafter Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or court process. The restrictions of this Section 7.10 do
not apply to communications (i) in connection with and following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 7.04 or a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 7.06; (ii) in connection with any Action regarding a dispute between the Parties
regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) if the information contained therein substantially reiterates (or is
consistent with) previous releases, public disclosures or public statements made by the Company and/or Parent in compliance with this Section 7.10.

Listing Application covering the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to this Agreement to be listed on NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time.

and the Company and the members of its respective board of directors, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, shall grant such approvals and
take such actions, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, as are necessary so that the Contemplated Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise, to the extent permissible
under applicable Law, act to eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the Contemplated Transactions.
Section 7.13. Section 16 Matters. Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, cause the Parent Board to approve the issuance of the Merger
Consideration with respect to any employees of the Company who, as a result of their relationship with Parent as of or following the Effective Time, are
subject or will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent necessary for such issuance to be an exempt
acquisition pursuant to SEC Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall approve the disposition of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by those directors and officers of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent necessary for such disposition to be an exempt disposition pursuant to SEC Rule 16b-3. 
Section 7.14. Transaction Litigation. Each of the Company and Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the other Party (including
by providing copies of all pleadings and any material correspondence with respect thereto) of any Transaction Litigation and shall keep the other Party
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Each of the Company and Parent shall provide the other Party with the opportunity to participate
in the defense of any Transaction Litigation with respect to the first Party or the Contemplated Transactions. For purposes of this Section 7.14,
“participate” means that the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall keep the other Party reasonably apprised of the proposed strategy and other
significant decisions with respect to any Transaction Litigation, and the other Party may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction
Litigation which the first Party shall consider in good faith. Prior to the Effective Time, other than with respect to any Transaction Litigation where the
parties are adverse to each other or in the context of any Transaction Litigation related to or arising out of a Company Acquisition Proposal or a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, neither the Company nor Parent shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to comprise, settle or come to
an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which, with respect to any such settlement that
only requires payment of monetary amounts by the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.14, (a) in the event of any conflict with any other covenant or agreement contained in Section
7.07 that expressly addresses the subject matter of this Section 7.14, Section 7.07 shall govern and control, and (b) this Section 7.14 shall be in addition to
and not limit or otherwise modify the Parties’ respective obligations under Section 7.04, Section 7.05 and Section 7.06.
Section 7.15. Cooperation. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall direct its respective Representatives to, use its commercially reasonable
efforts, subject to applicable Laws and Section 7.01, to cooperate with the other party in connection with planning the integration of the business
operations of Parent and the Company.
Section 7.16. Tax Matters.
(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Agreement is intended to constitute, and the Parties hereto hereby adopt this
Agreement as, a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code and within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g) (the “Intended Tax Treatment”). Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties shall (i) not take any action or fail to take any action, in either case, that
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment and
 
A-70
Table of Contents
(ii) report the Merger for all Tax purposes consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment unless otherwise required by a Governmental Body as a result of a
“determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts and shall
cooperate with one another to obtain (x) the opinion of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz or another nationally recognized tax counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Company (“Company Tax Counsel”), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to
the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the Merger will qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (y) any opinion(s) of Company Tax Counsel to be issued in connection with the
declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement by the SEC regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Merger. In connection with
the foregoing, (i) Parent shall deliver to Company Tax Counsel a duly executed officer’s certificate substantially in the form set forth in Schedule 7.16(a) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter (the “Parent Tax Certificate”) and (ii) the Company shall deliver to Company Tax Counsel a duly executed officer’s certificate
substantially in the form set forth in Schedule 7.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the “Company Tax Certificate”), in the case of each of clause (i)
and (ii), at such times as counsel shall reasonably request (including in connection with the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and at the
Closing). Parent and the Company shall also provide such other information as reasonably requested by Company Tax Counsel for purposes of rendering
any opinion described in this Section 7.16(a). Company Tax Counsel shall be entitled to receive such reasonably requested information as Company Tax
Counsel shall determine for purposes of rendering such opinion. Company Tax Counsel shall be entitled to rely on the Parent Tax Certificate, the
Company Tax Certificate and any other information as Company Tax Counsel shall determine for purposes of rendering such opinion.  
(b) The Parties agree that the tax year of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes will end at the close of the Closing Date and that
the Company will join the U.S. federal consolidated tax return in which Parent is the common parent as of the opening of the next day. Parent shall post a
duly completed IRS Form 8937 on its website not later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date.
Section 7.17. Payoff Letters. At the written request of Parent, prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent an executed payoff letter from the administrative agent under the Company Credit
Agreement, which payoff letter shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and (a) set forth the amounts required to be paid in order to pay in full
all such amounts outstanding pursuant to the Company Credit Agreement as of the Closing (other than contingent obligations as to which no claim has
been asserted) (the “Payoff Amount”) and (b) provide that, upon payment in full of such amounts, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under the Company Credit Agreement (other than contingent obligations as to which no claim has been asserted) shall be terminated and all Liens on the
assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company securing amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement shall be released (the
“Credit Agreement Termination”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (x) in no event shall this Section 7.17 require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to cause the Credit Agreement Termination unless the Closing shall have occurred and (y) Parent shall pay, or shall cause one or more of
its Subsidiaries to pay, the Payoff Amount in full on behalf of the Company on the Closing Date.
Section 7.18. Company Convertible Notes. Prior to the Effective Time, within the time periods required by the terms of each Indenture, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions required by such Indenture to be performed by the
Company at or prior to the Effective Time as a result of the consummation of the Merger, including the giving of any notices that may be required by
Parent and the delivery to the trustee, of any documents or instruments required to be delivered at or prior to the Effective Time to such trustee, in each
case by such Indenture as a result of the consummation of the Merger; provided, that the Company shall, to the extent practicable, deliver a draft of any

in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, pursuant to each such Indenture and (ii) cause each the trustee under the Indentures
to execute and deliver at the Effective Time any such supplemental indentures, in each case required by the terms of such Indenture as a result of the

mutually determine, and use commercially reasonable efforts to implement, any necessary, appropriate or desirable elections under, or amendments,
adjustments, or waivers to, the Company Call Options and the Company Warrants, in each case in connection with the execution of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger, in order to allow the Company Call Options and Company Warrants to remain outstanding following the Closing (but
exercisable for Parent Common Stock) (subject to the rights of the counterparties thereto); provided, that nothing in this Section 7.19 shall require the
Company or Parent to (A) pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any payment in connection with any Company Call Options or
Company Warrants prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time or (B) agree to any election, amendment, adjustment, waiver or any other change or

Section 10.11. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement, and the Parties shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid
provision that gives effect to the intent of the Parties to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.
Section 10.12. Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed by the Company, Parent, or Merger Sub in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
Company, Parent, or Merger Sub and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Except as set forth in Section
9.03, it is accordingly agreed that (a) the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof against Parent or Merger Sub in any court having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, including damages in the event of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s Fraud or
Intentional and Material Breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy or posting any bond
or other undertaking and (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the
Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof against the Company in any court having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent or Merger Sub is entitled at law or in equity, including damages in the event of the Company’s Fraud or Intentional and
Material Breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy or posting any bond or other
undertaking. The Parties further agree not to oppose the granting of an injunction, specific enforcement or other equitable relief on the basis that any
other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The
Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 10.12 are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would enter into this Agreement.

covenants under this Agreement and covenants and agrees not to seek any injunction, order or other equitable remedy with respect to the performance
of the Stockholders’ obligations hereunder or the voting of the Covered Shares.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to Globus Medical, Inc. (the “Company”) of the 0.75 shares of Class A
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of the Company to be issued in exchange for each share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the “NuVasive Common Stock”), of NuVasive, Inc. (“NuVasive”) (the “Exchange Ratio”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of February 8, 2023 (the “Agreement”), by and among the Company, Zebra Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, and NuVasive.
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its
affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest,
may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit
default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, NuVasive and any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including affiliates of Mr.
David C. Paul, a significant shareholder of the Company (the “Significant Shareholder”), or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, all of
which are contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify
us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to
the Company, NuVasive, the Significant Shareholder and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking may receive
compensation.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to shareholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-
K of the Company and NuVasive for the five years ended December 31, 2021; certain interim reports to shareholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
of the Company and NuVasive; certain other communications from the Company and NuVasive to their respective shareholders; certain publicly available
research analyst reports for the Company and NuVasive; certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for NuVasive prepared by its management; and
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company standalone and pro forma for the Transaction and certain financial analyses and
forecasts for NuVasive, in each case, as prepared by the management of the Company and approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”),
including certain operating synergies projected by the management of the

Company to result from the Transaction, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Synergies”). We have also held discussions with members of the
senior managements of the Company and NuVasive regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and
future prospects of NuVasive and with the members of senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business
operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company and the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the Transaction;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Company Common Stock and the shares of NuVasive Common Stock; compared certain
financial and stock market information for the Company and NuVasive with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are
publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the healthcare industry and in other industries; and performed
such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts, including the Synergies, have been reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation
or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or NuVasive
or any of their respective subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the
Company or NuVasive or on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We also have assumed that the Transaction
will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in
any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This
opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the Company, as of the date hereof, of the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the
Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or
aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including,
the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other
constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors
or employees of the Company or NuVasive, or any class of such persons in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Exchange Ratio
pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Company Common Stock or NuVasive
Common Stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, NuVasive or the
Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or NuVasive or the ability of the Company or NuVasive to
pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect
on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion
based on circumstances,

developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and

recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This
