"Resource REIT, Inc._20220314_DEFM14A_19942780_4408792.Pdf",The Special Meeting,"The Special Meeting (page 25)
The Proposals
The special meeting of our stockholders will be held on May 16, 2022 at 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the
virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RSRL2022SM. At the special meeting, holders of our common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (“common stock”), will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the merger (the “merger
proposal”), (2) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the “advisory compensation proposal”), and (3) a proposal to approve any
adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve
the merger proposal (the “adjournment proposal”).
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on March 3, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of
and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast one
vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record
date, there were 166,259,239 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence virtually via the special meeting website or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled
to be cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the
special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present
at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later date (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement,
including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not be held, without Parent’s consent, on a date that is more than 30 days after the
date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled or more than 120 days from the original record date).
Required Vote
Completion of the merger requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a
majority of all the votes of our common stock entitled to be cast on the
2Table of Contents
merger proposal (the “stockholder approval”). Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our common
stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual
special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST”
the merger proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail
to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will not have any
effect on the outcome of such proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of such
proposals.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 1,375,532 shares of common
stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.8% of the voting power of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Our directors
and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares of common stock that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor
of the advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.
Under the terms of our charter, the merger also requires approval of the holders of at least two-third of the outstanding shares of our convertible
stock, par value $0.01 per share (“convertible stock”) entitled to vote on the merger (excluding shares of convertible stock held by the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company (collectively, “excluded convertible stock”), which are not entitled to vote on the merger). On January 23, 2022, the
holders of 13,536 shares of our convertible stock, representing approximately 72.7% of the voting power of our convertible stock entitled to vote on
the merger, including our executive officers, certain employees and our former president, executed written consents to approve the merger in
accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) and our charter and bylaws.
Proxies and Revocation
Any holder of record of our common stock entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of common stock by returning the
enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by attending the virtual special meeting and
voting during the live webcast. If the shares of common stock that you own are held in “street name” by your broker, you should instruct your
broker on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your broker.
Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by your delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy card, by authorizing your proxy
by telephone or through the Internet at a later date than your previously authorized proxy, by your filing a written revocation of your proxy with our
Corporate Secretary or by your voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting alone will not be sufficient to revoke a
previously authorized proxy.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, on the closing date, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub and the separate existence of the
Company will cease. Merger Sub will continue as the Surviving Entity in the merger. We and Merger Sub will cause articles of merger to be executed
and filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland and cause a certificate of merger to be executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The merger will become effective upon the later of the

acceptance for record of the articles of merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, the filing of the certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or on such other date and time (not to exceed 30 days from the date the articles of merger
are accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland) as may be agreed between the parties to the merger
agreement and specified in the articles of merger and certificate of merger. We use the term “merger effective time” in this proxy statement to refer to
the time the merger becomes effective.

On January 23, 2022, Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (“Lazard”) rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written
opinion, dated January 23, 2022, to our board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors,
qualifications and limitations set forth in the written opinion, the common stock merger consideration (as defined below) to be paid to the holders of
common stock (other than holders of excluded common stock (as defined below)) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated January 23, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered
and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit

reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read Lazard’s opinion and this section carefully and in their entirety.
Lazard’s engagement and its opinion were for the benefit of our board of directors (in its capacity as such) and Lazard’s opinion was rendered to our
board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger and addressed only the fairness, as of the date of the opinion, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of common stock (other than the holders of excluded common stock) of the common stock merger consideration to be
paid to such holders in the merger. Lazard’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how
such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the merger or any matter relating thereto.

Common Stock
The merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of common stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than shares of common stock held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by
Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub (collectively, “excluded common stock” and, together with the excluded convertible
stock, the “excluded stock”)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $14.75 per share,
without interest (such per share amount, the “common stock merger consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded common
stock will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a
consequence of, the merger. If we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid
the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the common stock merger
consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock.
Convertible Stock
The merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of convertible stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than excluded convertible stock) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $1,846.76 per share, without interest (such per share amount, the “convertible stock merger consideration” and,
together with the common stock merger consideration, the “merger consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded convertible
stock will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a
consequence of, the merger.
Time Vested Restricted Stock
The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of unvested time vested
restricted common stock (“time vested restricted stock”) granted pursuant to the Resource REIT, Inc. 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended
(the “Long-Term Incentive Plan”), including shares held by our directors and executive officers, will automatically become fully vested and all
restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter the shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered
outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will only have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock
merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Additionally, in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements, in no
event later than five business days after the merger effective time, we will pay to each holder of time vested restricted stock an amount equal to all
accrued and unpaid cash dividends up to, and including, the merger effective time, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Performance Restricted Stock
The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of unvested performance-based
restricted common stock (“performance restricted stock”) granted pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, including shares held by our executive
officers, will automatically become vested assuming target-level achievement of all applicable performance-based vesting requirements and all
restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter the shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered
outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will only have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock

In connection with the closing of the merger, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $2.5 billion to be paid to the holders of common stock,
convertible stock, time vested restricted stock and performance restricted stock (other than excluded stock). Parent has informed us that in
connection with the closing of the merger, Parent expects to assume our structured credit facility and to cause the outstanding indebtedness under
our revolving credit facility, if any, to be prepaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans to be repaid or remain
outstanding. As of February 25, 2022, we had approximately $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of consolidated secured indebtedness,
including approximately $495 million outstanding under our structured credit facility and approximately $715 million in mortgage loans outstanding.
As of February 25, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
Parent has informed us that it currently intends to pursue obtaining debt financing to be provided in connection with the merger. In addition, it is
expected that BREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Sponsor”), which is the operating partnership of BREIT, and its
affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered
by such debt financing.
Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing may
be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and
expenses related to the financing and the merger. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the potential
debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned by us, certain
escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable collateral,
and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the merger being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings.
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the merger. We have agreed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide, all customary
cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in connection with the arrangement of debt financing with respect to us or our subsidiaries,
or our or our subsidiaries’ real property. For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement—Financing Cooperation” and “The
Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger.”

Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among
other matters, in reaching its decision to approve the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. See the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” for information about interests

defined below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Stockholders’ Meeting”) or inquiry (as defined below in the section entitled “The

engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person information in connection
with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry, or resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, we may participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, and furnish information (including
non-public information) to, any person that has made, renewed or delivered to us a bona fide written competing proposal after the date of the merger
agreement and prior to obtaining the stockholder approval (that did not result from a breach of our obligations described in the sections entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals” and “The Merger Agreement—Obligation of Our Board of Directors
with Respect to Its Recommendation”), if our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) that such competing proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal
(as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals”). Under certain
circumstances and after following certain procedures and adhering to certain restrictions, we are permitted to terminate the merger agreement if our
board of directors approves, and substantially concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement, we enter into, a definitive agreement

In connection with the merger agreement, the Sponsor entered into a limited guarantee in our favor to guarantee Parent’s payment obligations with
respect to the parent termination payment and certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under the merger agreement,
subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the limited guarantee.
The maximum aggregate liability of the Sponsor under the limited guarantee will not exceed $258 million, plus all reasonable and documented third-
party costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) actually incurred by us relating to any litigation or other proceeding
brought by us to enforce our rights under the limited guarantee if we prevail in such litigation or proceeding.
We cannot seek specific performance to require Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the merger and, except with respect to enforcing
confidentiality provisions, our sole and exclusive remedy against Parent or Merger Sub relating to any breach of the merger agreement or otherwise
will be the right to receive the parent termination payment and certain expense reimbursements and other costs under the conditions described in the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Payments—Parent Termination Payment.” Parent and Merger Sub may, however, seek
specific performance to require us to consummate the merger.

We are unaware of any material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required for the execution of the merger
agreement or the completion of the merger, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger by the State Department of Assessments

We are organized as a corporation under Maryland law. Holders of our stock may not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of
an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by the MGCL, our
charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such rights unless our board of directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors, determines that the rights apply. Our board of directors has made no such determination. However, our common stockholders can vote
against the merger proposal.

The receipt of the common stock merger consideration for each share of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the
difference, if any, between the common stock merger consideration you receive and your adjusted tax basis in your shares. In addition, under certain
circumstances, we may be required to withhold a portion of your merger consideration under applicable tax laws, including pursuant to the Foreign
Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend
on your particular tax situation. We encourage you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the merger to you.",18,18

"Resource REIT, Inc._20220314_DEFM14A_19942780_4408792.Pdf",QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following questions and answers briefly address some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the proposed merger. These
questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the exhibits and the additional documents to which it refers, including the merger agreement, a
copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A.
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
A:
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company and its subsidiaries by affiliates of BREIT pursuant to the merger agreement. Once the
merger proposal has been approved by the holders of our common stock and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement have been
satisfied or waived, at the merger effective time, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the Surviving
Entity. For additional information about the merger, please review the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A and
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the
principal document governing the merger.
Q:
As a holder of common stock, what will I receive in the merger?
A:
For each outstanding share of common stock that you own immediately prior to the merger effective time, you will receive $14.75 in cash, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
What will holders of convertible stock receive in the merger?
A:
For each outstanding share of convertible stock owned immediately prior to the merger effective time, the holder thereof will receive $1,846.76 in
cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
Will I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the common stock that I own?
A:
Under the terms of the merger agreement, we are permitted to declare and pay our regular quarterly dividends per share of common stock for the
first and second quarters of 2022 in accordance with past practice and in an amount not to exceed $0.07 per share. We are also permitted to declare
and pay dividends on our common stock required for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the incurrence of any
income or excise taxes under the Code (with any such additional required dividend resulting in a corresponding decrease to the common stock
merger consideration). We may not otherwise declare, set aside or pay any dividends, or make any other actual, constructive or deemed
distributions, subject to limited exceptions described in the third bullet of the second paragraph in the section titled “The Merger Agreement—
Conduct of Our Business Pending the Merger.”
Q:
What will happen to my shares of time vested restricted stock and performance restricted stock?
A:
Time Vested Restricted Stock. Effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of time vested restricted stock will
automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter the shares of common stock
represented thereby will only have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock merger consideration, less any applicable
withholding taxes. Additionally, we will pay to each holder of time vested restricted stock an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash
dividends up to, and including, the merger effective time, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Performance Restricted Stock. Effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of performance restricted stock will
automatically become vested assuming target-level achievement
12Table of Contents
of all applicable performance-based vesting requirements and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter the shares of
common stock represented thereby will only have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock merger consideration, less any
applicable withholding taxes. Additionally, we will pay to each holder of performance restricted stock an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
cash dividends up to, and including, the merger effective time, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
What will happen to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan and Share Redemption Program?
A:
In connection with the proposed merger, on January 23, 2022, our board of directors approved the suspension of our Distribution Reinvestment
Plan (the “Distribution Reinvestment Plan”) and our Fifth Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program, dated February 3, 2021 (the “Share
Redemption Program”), effective immediately.
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
If the holders of our common stock vote to approve the merger proposal, and assuming that the other conditions to the merger are satisfied or
waived, it is anticipated that the merger will be completed in the second quarter of 2022. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the merger
will take place on the third business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger described under the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger” (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the closing of the
merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing) or on such other date as agreed in writing by us and Parent.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger proposal is not approved by our common stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will
not receive any payment for their common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, we will remain an independent company, our common
stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, and our common stock, convertible stock, time vested restricted stock and
performance restricted stock will remain outstanding. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, we will be required
to pay Parent the company termination payment. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay us the parent termination payment
upon termination of the merger agreement.
Q:
If the merger is completed, how do I obtain the common stock merger consideration for my shares?
A:
Following the completion of the merger, your common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the common
stock merger consideration. In accordance with, and as required by the paying agent’s customary procedures, you may receive an instruction
request letter, including instructions for effecting the exchange of your shares for the common stock merger consideration.
Q:
When and where is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will be held on May 16, 2022 at 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special meeting,
stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RSRL2022SM.
Q:
Who can vote and attend the special meeting?
A:
All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on March 3, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of
and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast one
vote on each
13
Table of Contents
matter presented at the special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, there
were 166,259,239 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Q:
How do I attend the virtual special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will be held in a virtual-only format on May 16, 2022 at 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time. You will not be able to physically attend the
special meeting. To access the virtual meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RSRL2022SM. The special meeting
will start promptly at 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, and online access will begin at 1:45 p.m., Eastern Time. To log in to the virtual meeting, you will be
required to enter a control number, included on your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive, which will allow you
to participate in the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder as of the record date.
Q:
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the merger proposal?
A:
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes of our
common stock entitled to be cast on the merger proposal. Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our
common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting
instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Q:
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the advisory compensation proposal?
A:
Approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of
this proposal, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will
have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
Q:
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the adjournment proposal?
A:
Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this
proposal, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have
no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
Q:
Why is my vote important?
A:
If you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote at the virtual special meeting, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary
quorum to hold the special meeting. In addition, because the merger proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of our
common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes of our common stock entitled to be cast on the merger proposal, your failure to authorize
your proxy or voting instructions or to vote at the virtual special meeting will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Q:
How does the common stock merger consideration compare to our net asset value?
A:
The common stock merger consideration of $14.75 per share represents a premium of approximately 63% over our most recently published net asset
value (“NAV”) of $9.06 per share, which was determined by our board of directors as of January 28, 2021.
14
Table of Contents
Q:
How does our board of directors recommend that I vote?
A:
Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the
adjournment proposal.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related compensation payable to our
named executive officers?
A:
In July 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to
approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
corporate transactions such as the merger.
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory compensation proposal?
A:
The vote to approve the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Approval of
this proposal is a not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our
board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the advisory compensation proposal, if the merger is completed, our named executive
officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.
Q:
Do any of the Company’s directors and executive officers have any interest in the merger that is different than mine?
A:
Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
generally. See the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” for information about the
interests that our directors and executive officers have in the merger that are different than yours.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, including the exhibits attached to this proxy statement,
please vote your shares of common stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. Holders of our common stock will be entitled to
one vote for each share of common stock owned as of the record date.
Q:
How do I cast my vote?
A:
If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote at the virtual special meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares
at the virtual special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope, or, if you prefer, by following the instructions on your proxy card for telephonic or Internet
proxy authorization. If the telephone or Internet option is available to you, we strongly encourage you to use it because it is faster and less costly.
Registered stockholders can transmit their voting instructions by telephone by calling (800) 690-6903 or on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com.
Telephone and Internet voting are available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day immediately prior to the special meeting. Have
your proxy card with you if you are going to authorize your proxy by telephone or through the Internet. To authorize your proxy by mail, please
complete sign, date and mail your proxy card in the envelope provided.

Table of Contents
Q:
How do I cast my vote if my shares of common stock are held of record in “street name”?
A:
If you own common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with
the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, since brokers, banks and other nominees
do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement. If you have not received such
voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you
directions on how to vote your common stock. If you hold your common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and wish to vote at the
virtual special meeting, you must obtain a “legal proxy,” executed in your favor, from the broker, bank or other nominee (which may take several
days).
Q:
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?
A:
With respect to the merger proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your
shares in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST”
the merger proposal. With respect to the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast
your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker,
bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
Q:
How will proxy holders vote my shares of common stock?
A:
If you properly authorize a proxy prior to the virtual special meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct. If you authorize a
proxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and
“FOR” the adjournment proposal. Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the
virtual special meeting.
Q:
What happens if I sell my common stock before the special meeting?
A:
If you held common stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective time, you will retain your right to vote at the special
meeting, but not the right to receive the common stock merger consideration for such shares. The right to receive the common stock merger
consideration when the merger becomes effective will pass to the person who owns the shares you previously owned.
Q:
Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it is
exercised by filing with our Corporate Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending and voting at
the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you
have instructed a broker to vote your shares, the foregoing options for changing your vote do not apply and instead you must follow the
instructions received from your broker to change your vote.
Q:
Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?
A:
Yes. The receipt of the common stock merger consideration for each share of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured
by the difference, if
16
Table of Contents
any, between the common stock merger consideration you receive and your adjusted tax basis in your common stock. In addition, under certain
circumstances, we may be required to withhold a portion of your common stock merger consideration under applicable tax laws, including FIRPTA.
See the section entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” for a more complete discussion of the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your
particular tax situation. We encourage you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the merger to you.
Q:
What rights do I have if I oppose the merger?
A:
If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the merger proposal. You are not, however, entitled to exercise
any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in connection
with the merger because, as permitted by the MGCL, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise any such rights unless our
board of directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors, determines that the rights apply. Our board of directors has made no
such determination. See the section entitled “No Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal.”
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed
with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov when
filed.
Q:
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the virtual special meeting?
A:
If you are unable to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your
proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet.
Q:
Have any stockholders already agreed to approve the merger?
A:
Yes. Under the terms of our charter, the merger also requires approval of the holders of at least two-third of the outstanding shares of our
convertible stock entitled to vote on the merger (excluding shares of excluded convertible stock, which are not entitled to vote on the merger). On
January 23, 2022, the holders of 13,536 shares of our convertible stock, representing approximately 72.7% of the voting power of our convertible
stock entitled to vote on the merger, including our executive officers, certain employees and our former president, executed written consents to
approve the merger in accordance with the MGCL and our charter and bylaws. There are no other agreements between Parent, Merger Sub or other
affiliates of Blackstone, on the one hand, and any of our stockholders, on the other hand, in which a stockholder has agreed to vote in favor of the
approval of the merger proposal.
Q:
Where can I find more information about the Company?
A:
We file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.resourcereit.com. The
information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this proxy statement or
any other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC. You can also request copies of these documents from us. See the section entitled
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview,
telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers
17
Table of Contents
and other employees, for which they will not receive additional compensation. We have engaged Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.
(“Broadridge”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $450,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
and we have agreed to indemnify Broadridge against certain losses, costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations
holding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees, that are beneficially owned by others to send or cause to be sent proxy materials
to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners and will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing.

This proxy statement, including the exhibits, contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act). Also, documents we subsequently file
with the SEC and incorporate by reference may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements
about the expected benefits of the merger, the expected timing and completion of the merger and our future business, performance and opportunities.
Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on reasonable assumptions, there can be
no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, and you should not rely on
them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods which may be incorrect or imprecise, and we
may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all).
Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable
by use of the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “may,” “plan,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “likely” or similar
expressions. You should not rely on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are, in
some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect actual results, performances or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results to
differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to:
•
risks associated with our ability to obtain the stockholder approval and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to closing in the
merger agreement;
•
the timing of the closing of the merger, including the risks that a condition to closing would not be satisfied within the expected timeframe,
or at all, or that the closing of the merger will not occur;
•
the outcome of the legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the merger agreement;
•
unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the merger;
•
the response of business partners and competitors to the announcement of the merger;
•
potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the merger;
•
risks associated with the disruption of management’s attention from ongoing business operations due to the merger;
•
our exclusive remedy against the counterparties to the merger agreement with respect to any breach of the merger agreement being to seek
payment of the parent termination payment, which may not be adequate to cover our damages;
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement and, under certain
circumstances, require us to pay the company termination payment;
•
our restricted ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement;
•
the continuing adverse effect of the ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the related measures on our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance, particularly our ability to collect rent, the personal financial condition of our
tenants and their ability to pay rent, and the real estate market and the global economy and financial markets;
•
changes in national, regional and local economic conditions and market conditions;
•
availability of suitable investment opportunities;
19Table of Contents
•
changes in financial markets and interest rates;
•
the availability and terms of future financing and capital;
•
the nature and extent of future competition;
•
legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect our business;
•
our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT; and
•
the additional risks and factors discussed in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time, including those discussed under the heading
“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as updated in our subsequent Quarterly Reports

There can be no assurance that the merger will in fact be consummated in the expected time frame, on the expected terms or at all. There can be no
assurance as to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other potential future outbreaks of infectious diseases on our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows and performance and those of our tenants, as well as on the economy and real estate and financial markets, which may impact the
timing or occurrence of the merger. While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We
disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see the section entitled
“Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as updated in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on

MERGER PROPOSAL
We are asking our common stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub.
For detailed information regarding the merger proposal, see the information about the merger and the merger agreement throughout this proxy statement,
including the information set forth in the sections entitled “The Merger” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Exhibit A to this proxy statement.
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes of our
common stock entitled to be cast on the merger proposal. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, but do not
indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 1, your shares will be voted in accordance with the
recommendation of our board of directors, which is “FOR” this Proposal 1. Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of
votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at
the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting
“AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Approval of the merger proposal is a condition to the completion of the merger. In the event the merger proposal is not approved, the merger cannot be
completed.
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

disclosure includes the Golden Parachute Compensation Table required pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”
Adoption of the above resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. If you

This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors to be exercised at a
special meeting to be held on May 16, 2022 at 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special meeting, stockholders
should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RSRL2022SM. The special meeting will be held in a virtual-only meeting format. You will be required to
enter a control number, included on your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive, which will allow you to participate in
the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder as of the record date.
At the special meeting, holders of our common stock will be asked to consider and vote on:
1.
a proposal to approve the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub;
2.
a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger; and
3.
a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes
at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal.
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting. The affirmative vote
of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes of our common stock entitled to be cast on the merger proposal is required
to approve the merger proposal and for the merger to occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement, which we
encourage you to read carefully in its entirety.

All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on March 3, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and
attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on
each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, there were
166,259,239 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting will
constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. Virtual attendance at the special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at
the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes
of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later
date.",32,32

Completion of the merger requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority
of all the votes of our common stock entitled to be cast on the merger proposal. Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the
number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares
or vote at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as
voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on
the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to
25Table of Contents
completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special
meeting, or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes
cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
Accordingly, in order for your shares to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must either return the enclosed proxy card, authorize your proxy
or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet or vote at the virtual special meeting.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 1,375,532 shares of common
stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.8% of the voting power of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Our directors and
executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares of common stock that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of the
advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.
Under the terms of our charter, the merger also requires approval of the holders of at least two-third of the outstanding shares of our convertible stock
entitled to vote on the merger (excluding shares of excluded convertible stock, which are not entitled to vote on the merger). On January 23, 2022, the
holders of 13,536 shares of our convertible stock, representing approximately 72.7% of the voting power of our convertible stock entitled to vote on the
merger, including our executive officers, certain employees and our former president, executed written consents to approve the merger in accordance with
the MGCL and our charter and bylaws.
Votes cast by proxy or at the virtual special meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of election for the special meeting.
The inspector of election will also determine the number of shares of common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy.",32,33
"Resource REIT, Inc._20220314_DEFM14A_19942780_4408792.Pdf",How to Authorize a Proxy,"How to Authorize a Proxy
Holders of record of our common stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of the following methods:
•
mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail;
•
authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions included with your proxy
card; or
•
attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast.
Regardless of whether you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares of common stock as described
above as promptly as possible.
A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker, trust or other
nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular
proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if you own common stock through a broker, bank or other
nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker,
bank or other nominee provides to you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three
proposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your common stock following the
directions contained in such voting instruction card. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such
voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your common stock. If you hold your
26Table of Contents
common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a “legal proxy,” executed in your
favor, from the broker, bank or other nominee (which may take several days). Because approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes of our common stock entitled to be cast on the merger proposal, the failure to
provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal. Because
the approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on
such proposal, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to
provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is
present.

If you authorize a proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted at the special meeting as you indicate on your proxy. If no instructions are indicated
when you authorize your proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors. Our board
of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
You may revoke your proxy at any time, but only before the proxy is voted at the virtual special meeting, in any of three ways:
•
by delivering, prior to the date of the special meeting, a written revocation of your proxy dated after the date of the proxy that is being
revoked to our Corporate Secretary at Resource REIT, Inc., 1845 Walnut Street, 17th Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103;
•
by delivering to our Corporate Secretary a later-dated, duly executed proxy or by authorizing your proxy by telephone or by Internet at a
date after the date of the previously authorized proxy relating to the same shares of common stock; or
•
by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting.
Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy. If you own shares of common stock
through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may revoke or change previously granted voting instructions by following the instructions provided by the
broker, bank or other nominee that is the registered owner of the shares.
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting.

We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview,
telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees, for which they will not receive additional compensation. We have
engaged Broadridge to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $450,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and we have

Background of the Merger",36,36
"Resource REIT, Inc._20220314_DEFM14A_19942780_4408792.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
As part of its ongoing oversight, direction and management of the Company, our board of directors and management team regularly review and discuss
the Company’s performance, business plan, strategic direction and future prospects. These discussions have periodically, in the ordinary course of
business, included evaluation of potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. In particular, our board of directors has been focused on
positioning the Company for a successful liquidity event for some time given the Company’s status as a non-traded REIT and the fact that, under the
terms of our charter, we are required to consider listing our common stock or liquidating the Company before February 2022, which is the sixth
anniversary of the termination of our initial public offering. We, Resource Real Estate Opportunity REIT, Inc. (“REIT I”) and Resource Apartment REIT III,
Inc. (“REIT III”) were originally externally advised by the same sponsor and, in January 2021, we completed mergers with REIT I and REIT III with a view
to improving our ability to execute a successful liquidity event for our stockholders. Those mergers increased our size, lowered our cost of capital and, as
a result of the merger with REIT I and a previously executed self-administration transaction, made us self-managed, all of which we believed would
increase opportunities for stockholder liquidity.
After several months of operations as a self-managed Company and following the integration of the portfolios of REIT I and REIT III, we initiated a plan
to market and sell certain properties in less desirable geographies and to use the proceeds to pay down debt to improve our prospects for a successful
listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange. These properties were marketed on a staggered basis during the last three quarters of 2021.
Potential buyers for those properties consistently provided us with indications of interest reflecting a significant premium as compared to the valuations
for those properties obtained from the third-party valuation firm that assisted with our calculation of our NAV at the time of the mergers with REIT I and
REIT III. Given the favorable market conditions, on August 25, 2021, our board of directors, with the assistance of management, discussed potential
benefits from listing our common stock on a national securities exchange, including providing our existing stockholders with liquidity and an opportunity
to participate in our future earnings and growth. Our board of directors and management also reviewed plans for beginning discussions with financial
advisors regarding a potential listing of our common stock as well as a potential sale of the Company. Our board of directors concurred with
management’s recommendation to meet with financial advisors and explore potential avenues for obtaining liquidity for our stockholders.
In September 2021, members of our management met with nine separate financial advisors to discuss our prospects for a listing of our common stock or a
sale of the Company. On September 23, 2021, at a meeting with our board of directors, members of our management summarized the feedback from various
potential financial advisors, noting, among other things, the view of these financial advisors regarding (1) the favorable market conditions for a listing of
our common stock or a sale of the Company, (2) a projected initial listing price of $9.00 to $10.00 per share of common stock based on an offering of $250
million to $500 million of common stock, and (3) the potential to receive offers to acquire the Company at estimated prices of $12.00 to $13.00 per share of
common stock or higher. Management recommended exploring the potential sale of the Company before incurring the expense of pursuing a listing of our
common stock on a national securities exchange and, specifically, recommended engaging Lazard as our financial adviser to assist in our evaluation of
strategic alternatives and a potential sale process. After considering management’s recommendations, the overall reputation, experience and
qualifications of Lazard and the other financial advisors, as well as their knowledge of the real estate market and our business and operations in particular,
our board of directors concurred with management’s recommendation to engage Lazard as our financial advisor with respect to the potential process and
transaction.
29Table of Contents
On October 7, 2021, we executed an engagement letter with Lazard pursuant to which, as part of this engagement, at the request of our board of directors,
Lazard would evaluate whether the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock (other than excluded
common stock) in a sale transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
On October 18, 2021, our board of directors met with members of our management to discuss, among other things, the favorable pricing of certain
properties that we were marketing for sale and other factors that indicated market conditions continued to be favorable for property sales. Based on input
from the various financial advisors with which management met in September 2021, management and our board of directors also discussed certain risks
associated with a listing of our common stock and continuing as a publicly traded company, including risks related to potential volatility in the market
price and trading volume of our common stock, the amount of institutional investor demand for our common stock, and our expected leverage levels,
access to capital and ability to grow through the acquisition of suitable properties.
On October 20, 2021, our board of directors met to discuss, among other things, the exploration of a potential sale of the Company. Members of our
management and representatives of Lazard were present. The representatives of Lazard reviewed current market conditions and the proposed process for
soliciting indications of interest for a sale of the Company. Our board of directors discussed the strategic alternatives potentially available to us,
including remaining as an independent public company, pursuing a listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange and a potential sale of
the Company. Our board of directors and the representatives of Lazard also discussed certain risks and benefits of commencing a sale process in which
parties would be invited to review confidential information and submit indications of interest with respect to a potential sale of the Company, including
risks related to potential disruptions to our business and management’s attention from ongoing operations, loss of key employees and the need to
disclose proprietary and confidential information to current and potential competitors, and the benefits of obtaining near-term liquidity and potential
certainty of value for our stockholders. After discussion of the potential risks associated with a listing of our common stock discussed above and the
potential risks and benefits of a sale process, our board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of our stockholders to take steps to
further explore a potential sale of the Company, including establishing a formal sale process involving a broad outreach to potential bidders.
Between October 18 and December 1, 2021, at the direction of our board of directors, representatives of Lazard contacted 65 potential bidders to
participate in a formal sale process for the Company, including both strategic bidders and financial sponsors, 33 of which executed a confidentiality
agreement with us, including Blackstone. The parties that did not enter into a confidentiality agreement indicated that they were not interested in
pursuing a transaction with us at that time for various reasons, including, among others, concerns regarding the potential size of the transaction, the level
of expected competition from other potential bidders and the expected pricing and associated return profile of the transaction. Beginning on November 1,
2021, each bidder that signed a confidentiality agreement was given access to an electronic data room containing customary due diligence information
regarding us and our properties.
On November 9, 2021, at the direction of our board of directors, representatives of Lazard distributed to potential bidders an initial bid process letter. The
letter asked potential bidders to submit a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest for a potential acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of our
common stock and convertible stock by December 1, 2021. The potential bidders were also asked to share their expected sources of equity and debt
financing and the primary methodologies used and assumptions made to arrive at their proposed purchase price, among other things. Each potential
bidder was informed that its invitation to participate in a second round of bidding would be based, in our sole discretion, on a variety of factors, including
the potential bidder’s proposed purchase price and an assessment of its ability to complete the transaction expeditiously with minimal execution risk.
On December 1, 2021, 11 potential bidders submitted written indications of interest to us, including two strategic bidders and nine financial sponsors
(including Blackstone), as described below.

On December 6, 2021, a financial news organization reported that we were soliciting interests from potential bidders in connection with a possible sale of
the Company.
After the financial news article was published on December 6, 2021, four additional potential bidders contacted representatives of Lazard and were
subsequently invited to participate in the sale process, two of which executed a confidentiality agreement with us and were given access to the electronic
data room. In total, 35 potential bidders executed confidentiality agreements with us.
On December 8, 2021, our board of directors held a meeting to discuss, among other things, the written indications of interest that we received. Members
of our management and representatives of Lazard and DLA Piper, our outside legal counsel, were present. Representatives of Lazard reviewed the initial
indications of interest, noting that 11 written indications of interest were received at prices ranging from $11.45 to $13.00 per share of common stock (two
of which were primarily stock consideration proposals from other public companies and nine of which were all-cash consideration proposals from
financial sponsors, including an all-cash proposal from Blackstone at a price of $12.05 per share of common stock). The Lazard representatives added that
several bidders that submitted written indications of interest verbally communicated a potential willingness to pay more than $13.00 per share of common
stock. After further discussion, our board of directors unanimously determined that the prospects of favorable merger terms were sufficiently high to
warrant proceeding to a second round with a select group of bidders, targeting definitive proposals in mid-January, and directed our management and
Lazard to advance the sale process accordingly.
Following the meeting of our board of directors on December 8, 2021, representatives of Lazard conducted telephonic meetings with potential second-
round participants. With input from our board of directors and management and based on an assessment of each bidder’s ability to make a compelling
offer at a price in excess of $13.00 per share of common stock and complete a merger with minimal execution risk, four potential bidders were invited to
participate in a second round of bidding, consisting of Blackstone and two additional financial sponsors (which we refer to as Bidder A and Bidder B) and
one strategic bidder (which we refer to as Bidder C). Throughout December and early January, the potential bidders continued to conduct due diligence
on the Company, including through telephone calls and videoconferences with our management and advisors.
Between December 8 and 29, 2021, we provided additional customary due diligence information to Blackstone, Bidder A, Bidder B and Bidder C and their
respective advisors, arranged site visits at certain of our properties and made members of senior management available to such parties to address their
questions.
On December 29, 2021, a draft merger agreement prepared by DLA Piper was made available in the data room. The initial draft merger agreement
contemplated, among other things, a customary all-cash merger, our ability to continue paying regular dividends on our common stock, a company
termination payment equal to 2% of the equity value of the transaction and a parent termination payment equal to 12% of the equity value of the
transaction. The merger agreement also contemplated, and representatives of Lazard conveyed to bidders, that the amount of consideration to be paid to
holders of our convertible stock in the merger, who under our charter are entitled to separately vote upon the approval of the merger, would be calculated
utilizing the formula set forth in our charter based on the agreed-upon amount of consideration payable to the holders of our common stock. Drafts of an
equity commitment letter and limited guarantee were concurrently provided to the financial sponsors.
On January 4, 2022, representatives of Lazard distributed, on our behalf, second round bid process letters to each of Blackstone, Bidder A, Bidder B and
Bidder C. The letter asked each of these bidders to submit definitive proposals by January 19, 2022 to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our
common stock and convertible stock, which proposals were to include a definitive form of merger agreement that they were prepared to execute, as well as
to specify sources of financing, including commitment letters in final form. The bidders were also asked to submit marked up drafts of our proposed
merger agreement by January 12, 2022 and were informed that we and DLA Piper would provide feedback on the merger agreement mark-ups in advance
of the January 19, 2022 deadline.

Table of Contents
On January 5, 2022, in order to induce Bidder B to continue to participate in the sale process, we executed an expense reimbursement letter with Bidder B,
pursuant to which we agreed to reimburse certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Subsequently, Bidder B communicated to representatives of Lazard
that it was unable to proceed with an offer to acquire the Company. No payments became due to Bidder B under the terms of the expense reimbursement
letter.
On January 12, 2022, each of Blackstone, Bidder A and Bidder C, or their respective representatives, submitted marked up drafts of our proposed merger
agreement and related transaction documents. Blackstone’s draft of the merger agreement contemplated, among other things, a company termination
payment equal to 3.25% of the equity value of the transaction, a parent termination payment equal to 9% of the equity value of the transaction, that we
would not be entitled to specifically enforce the merger agreement, and that we would be permitted to pay regular quarterly dividends on our common
stock for the first and second quarters of 2022. From January 12 through January 19, 2022, DLA Piper and counsel to each of the bidders, including
Blackstone, held multiple calls and continued to exchange comments on the transaction documents.
On January 19, 2022, we received the following second-round proposals from Blackstone, Bidder A and Bidder C:
•
Blackstone proposed to acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction at a price of $14.65 per share of common stock. Blackstone’s
proposal also stated that it had completed all of its confirmatory due diligence, was prepared to sign a definitive merger agreement and had
sufficient discretionary equity capital to complete the transaction without any partners or financing contingency. Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett LLP (“Simpson Thacher”), outside counsel to Blackstone, also provided further revised mark-ups of the merger agreement, equity
commitment letter and limited guarantee, as well as a mark-up of the Company’s disclosure schedules to the merger agreement. The revised
merger agreement from Blackstone contemplated a company termination payment equal to 3% of the equity value of the transaction and a
parent termination payment equal to 10% of the equity value of the transaction.
•
Bidder A proposed to acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction at a price of $14.10 per share of common stock, and indicated that they
were unable to increase their offer price materially. Bidder A’s proposal also stated that it had completed all of the due diligence needed to
execute the merger agreement (subject only to certain confirmatory diligence that it did not expect to impact timing), and was prepared to
execute a definitive merger agreement. Bidder A also provided a revised mark-up of the merger agreement and drafts of debt and equity
commitment letters and a limited guarantee. The revised merger agreement from Bidder A contemplated, among other things, a company
termination payment equal to approximately 4% of the equity value of the transaction, a parent termination payment equal to 8% of the
equity value of the transaction, that we would be entitled to specifically enforce the merger agreement (subject to certain customary terms
and conditions) and that we would be permitted to pay regular quarterly dividends on our common stock in accordance with past practice
(including a prorated dividend for the portion of any quarter in which the closing occurs).
•
Bidder C proposed to acquire the Company in an all-stock merger with a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Bidder C common stock for the
outstanding shares of our common stock, resulting in an implied price range of $13.92 to $14.02 per share of our common stock based on a
range of various volume weighted average stock prices for Bidder C over the preceding 10- to 20-day period. Bidder C’s proposal also stated
that it had substantially completed its due diligence (subject to any further information provided), was prepared to negotiate, finalize and
execute a definitive merger agreement as soon as possible, had sufficient authorized but unissued shares to complete the transaction, and
would not require a stockholder vote, any third-party capital or any financing contingency to complete the transaction.
On January 19, 2022, Bidder C verbally communicated and, on January 20, 2022, submitted a revised proposal to acquire the Company in an all-stock
merger with a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Bidder C common stock for the outstanding shares of our common stock, resulting an implied price range
of $14.85 to
32
Table of Contents
$15.00 per share of our common stock based on a range of various volume weighted average stock prices for Bidder C over the preceding 10-to 20-day
period. In addition, on January 20, 2022, Bidder C provided a revised mark-up of the merger agreement. The revised merger agreement from Bidder C
contemplated, among other things, a company termination payment equal to 2.75% of the equity value of the transaction, that we would be entitled to
specifically enforce the merger agreement (subject to certain customary terms and conditions) and that we would be permitted to pay regular quarterly
dividends on our common stock in accordance with past practice.
On January 20, 2022, representatives of Lazard continued discussions with Blackstone, Bidder A and Bidder C, and communicated to Bidder A that it
needed to improve its proposed offer price. As previously noted, Bidder A had indicated that they were unable to increase their offer price materially and,
thereafter, there were no further discussions with Bidder A. Throughout the day on January 20, 2022, representatives of DLA Piper continued their review
and negotiation of merger agreement provisions and related documentation with representatives of Simpson Thacher and outside counsel to Bidder C.
On January 21, 2022, our board of directors met to discuss the sale process. Members of our management and representatives of Lazard and DLA Piper
were present. Representatives of Lazard reviewed the terms of the second-round proposals to acquire the Company from Blackstone and Bidder C,
including certain financial aspects of the proposals, and updated our board of directors as to the discussions they had with each of Blackstone and
Bidder C. Representatives of DLA Piper reviewed with our board of directors the proposed terms of the merger agreements with each of Blackstone and
Bidder C, summarized the key execution risks and material open issues associated with each proposal and suggested areas for further negotiation.
Representatives of DLA Piper also reviewed with our board of directors their fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale of the Company. Our
board of directors also discussed (1) the merits of paying retention and transaction bonuses to motivate and retain employees and officers through the
closing of the merger and (2) the other interests of management in the merger, including the value of our convertible stock under our charter. Our board of
directors also reviewed and discussed certain relationships between Blackstone and its affiliates and DLA Piper and the disclosure of material
relationships between Blackstone and its affiliates and Lazard over the last two years provided to our board of directors in advance of the meeting.
With input from representatives of Lazard and DLA Piper, our board of directors continued to compare the merits of Blackstone’s proposal to that of
Bidder C. Representatives of Lazard indicated that, based on a range of various volume weighted average stock prices for Bidder C over the preceding 10-
to 20-day period, the value of Bidder C’s consideration amounted to an implied price range of $14.85 to $15.00 per share of our common stock. In addition,
as of the date of the meeting, the value of Bidder C’s consideration amounted to an implied price of $14.41 per share of our common stock based on
Bidder C’s most recent closing price. Our board of directors noted with favor the certainty of the value of Blackstone’s all-cash offer of $14.65 per share of
common stock, Blackstone’s proven ability to complete large acquisition transactions on the agreed terms, as well as the nearly completed Blackstone
transaction documentation. Our board of directors also discussed certain positive aspects of Bidder C’s proposal, including the offer price, the potential
to benefit from any stock price appreciation prior to closing, the opportunity to participate in the long-term growth of the combined company and the
willingness of Bidder C to agree to specific performance remedies in the draft merger agreement, in contrast to Blackstone’s proposal, which provided that
our exclusive remedy is the receipt of the parent termination payment in certain circumstances. Our board of directors, however, also discussed certain
concerns associated with the all-stock consideration offered by Bidder C, including, among others, that Bidder C’s proposal used a fixed exchange ratio
pursuant to which our stockholders would receive a specific fraction of a Bidder C share of common stock for each share of our common stock regardless
of the value of Bidder C’s common Stock at the time of closing and, given that a transaction with Bidder C would likely take several months to close, our
stockholders would have no certainty of the value of the consideration they would receive at closing. After this discussion of various advantages and
disadvantages of the proposals from Blackstone and Bidder C, our board of directors concluded that Blackstone’s all-cash offer was more advantageous
to our stockholders for the reasons stated herein, and therefore determined to pursue further negotiations with Blackstone. Given the strength of Bidder
C’s proposal, however, our board of directors instructed representatives of Lazard to encourage Blackstone to increase its purchase price and the amount
of the parent termination payment.

Additionally, at the meeting of our board of directors on January 21, 2022, the members of the special committee of the board provided an update on the
status of their investigation of the facts, claims and circumstances that were the subject of the Stockholder Demand Letter (as defined below). As
previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 3, 2021, our board of directors increased the size of the board and
appointed Paula Baiman Brown and Alan F. Riffkin to serve as independent directors and members of the special committee of the board. The purpose of
this special committee was to impartially consider the allegations of breaches of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct by our directors and directors
of our predecessor entities (the “Stockholder Demand Letter”), and the special committee was granted the exclusive authority to consider and determine
whether or not the prosecution of any claims described in the Stockholder Demand Letter was in our best interest and what action we should take with
respect thereto. During the meeting on January 21, 2022, the members of the special committee indicated that the committee had nearly completed its
investigation and analysis of the allegations set forth in the Stockholder Demand Letter and expected to be in a position to report its final conclusions to
the board at its next meeting. The members of the special committee also described the committee’s process in evaluating the allegations, noting the
engagement of separate counsel, meetings of committee members, interviews with relevant personnel and external advisors and document review. The
members of the special committee reported their preliminary conclusions that (1) the claims alleged in the Stockholder Demand Letter (and subsequent
correspondence from the stockholder) had no merit, (2) even if they had potential merit, the costs and disruption of prosecuting those claims did not
justify pursuit of them, especially in light of the defenses to those claims, the speculative nature of any damages and the costs of prosecuting them and
(3) even if the claims alleged in the Stockholder Demand Letter had merit and the defenses to those claims were rejected, the maximum potential value of
those claims did not justify us proceeding with those claims in lieu of the proposed sale transactions being considered by our board of directors, which, if
consummated, would likely extinguish those claims. As part of their due diligence review, bidders in the sale process, including Blackstone, Bidder A and
Bidder C, were made aware of the Stockholder Demand Letter.
All members of our management then left the meeting and the independent directors met in executive session and continued discussions.
Representatives of Lazard and DLA Piper were in attendance. The independent directors, including all of the members of the compensation committee of
the board, discussed the proposed retention and transaction bonuses and the other interests of management in the proposed merger.
Following the meeting on January 21, 2022, at the direction of our board of directors, representatives of Lazard had a discussion with representatives of
Blackstone in which they proposed an increase in Blackstone’s purchase price to $14.75 per share of common stock and an increase in the amount of the
parent termination payment to 10.5% of the equity value of the transaction (representing approximately $80 million at the increased price) in exchange for
an increase in the amount of the company termination payment to 3.25% of the equity value of the transaction (representing approximately $258 million at
the increased price). In a subsequent discussion on January 21, 2022, representatives of Blackstone confirmed they were willing to move forward with
negotiating and finalizing a definitive merger agreement on the proposed terms.
Throughout the afternoon and evening of January 21, 2022, representatives of DLA Piper and Simpson Thacher exchanged drafts of the merger
agreement and related transaction documents. On January 22, 2022, representatives of DLA Piper and Simpson Thacher had a call to resolve open issues
on the merger agreement and, thereafter, continued to exchange further revised drafts of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.
Throughout the process, the key issues negotiated with Blackstone with respect to the merger agreement and related agreements included, among other
things, the representations and warranties to be made by the parties, the restrictions on the conduct of our business until completion of the transaction,
the conditions to completion of the mergers, our ability to participate in discussions or negotiations with third parties relating to unsolicited acquisition
proposals, the right of our board of directors to change its recommendation that stockholders approve the merger in response to a superior proposal or
otherwise, our right to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal under certain conditions, and the remedies available to the parties,
including the circumstances in which the company termination payment and parent termination payment would be payable.

On the morning of January 23, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting to discuss the final terms of the proposed transaction with Blackstone.
Members of our management and representatives of Lazard and DLA Piper were present. Management and the representatives of Lazard and DLA Piper
updated our board of directors on the discussions with Blackstone since the last board meeting and described the changes in Blackstone’s offer, noting,
among other things, the following: (1) an increase in the common stock merger consideration to $14.75 per share, resulting in convertible stock merger
consideration of $1,846.76 per share, (2) an increase in the company termination payment to $80 million or 3.25% of the equity value of the transaction,
and (3) an increase in the parent termination payment to $258 million or 10.5% of the equity value of the transaction. Representatives of DLA Piper also
provided a presentation regarding the terms of the merger agreement and related documents.
Representatives of Lazard next reviewed the financial analyses supporting its fairness opinion. After discussion among our board of directors,
representatives of Lazard delivered to our board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion, dated January
23, 2022, to our board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors
considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken described in Lazard’s written opinion, the $14.75 in cash per outstanding share of
common stock to be paid to the holders of common stock (other than holders of excluded common stock) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.
Additionally, the members of the special committee of the board reported that the committee had completed its interviews and analysis of the claims set
forth in the Stockholder Demand Letter and confirmed the preliminary conclusions of the committee that were conveyed at the meeting of our board of
directors held on January 21, 2022.
After further discussion of the merits of the merger, and taking into account the fairness opinion delivered by Lazard, and other factors described below
in greater detail under the section entitled “—Reasons for the Merger,” including our board of directors’ belief that the merger is more favorable to our
stockholders than other strategic transactions available to us, including remaining as an independent public company and listing our common stock, our
board of directors voted unanimously to adopt resolutions which, among other things, approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and recommended that our stockholders approve the merger.
During the course of the day on January 23, 2022, the parties finalized the transaction documents and proposed form of press release announcing the
execution of the merger agreement. Subsequently on January 23, 2022, the Company and Blackstone executed the merger agreement and all signatories to
the equity commitment letter and limited guarantee executed such agreements and the requisite holders of our convertible stock executed written
consents approving the merger in accordance with the MGCL and our charter and bylaws.
On the morning of January 24, 2022, before the opening of the markets, we issued a press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.
Reasons for the Merger",36,42
"Resource REIT, Inc._20220314_DEFM14A_19942780_4408792.Pdf",Reasons for the Merger,"Reasons for the Merger
In reaching its unanimous decision to determine and declare that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to recommend that our stockholders approve the merger, our board of directors consulted with
members of our management, as well as our financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors
which our board of directors viewed as supporting its decisions:
•
we conducted a thorough and diligent sale process, inviting 69 potential bidders to participate in the sale process, of which 35 potential
bidders executed confidentiality agreements, and only Blackstone,
35Table of Contents
Bidder A, Bidder B and Bidder C engaged in significant negotiations with us at highly competitive pricing levels;
•
at the conclusion of the sale process, Blackstone’s acquisition proposal was more favorable than the proposal presented by Bidder C for the
following reasons, among others:
•
a strategic transaction with Bidder C would be subject to a greater degree of uncertainty, because, among other things, Bidder C’s
proposal used a fixed exchange ratio pursuant to which our stockholders would receive a specific fraction of a Bidder C share of
common stock for each share of our common stock regardless of the value of Bidder C’s common stock at the time of the closing of a
transaction with Bidder C and, given that a transaction with Bidder C would take several months to close, our stockholders would
have relatively less certainty of the value of the consideration they would receive at the closing of the transaction; and
•
using the most recent closing price of Bidder C’s common stock, the value of Bidder C’s consideration amounted to an implied price of
$14.41 per share of our common stock;
•
our board of directors’ belief that, in light of our thorough and diligent sale process, the feedback we received from participants in the
process regarding their ability to pay sufficiently attractive merger consideration and the definitive proposals submitted by Blackstone and
Bidder A, it was unlikely that any other party would be willing to acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction for common stock merger
consideration in excess of $14.75 per share, and that further extending the deadline for proposals or otherwise soliciting other potential
buyers would not yield proposals of greater value or with increased certainty of closing;
•
the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the
closing of the merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent value from our
standalone business plan or other possible strategic alternatives involving transactions in which all or a portion of the consideration would
be payable in stock, such as with Bidder C;
•
the merger consideration was the result of arm’s-length negotiations between us and Blackstone, including several negotiated price
increases from the price in Blackstone’s initial indication of interest received on December 1, 2021 of $12.05 per share of our common stock,
and our board of directors’ belief that the merger consideration represented the highest price that Blackstone was willing to pay;
•
the common stock merger consideration of $14.75 per share represents a premium of approximately 63% over our most recently published
net asset value of $9.06 per share, which was determined by our board of directors as of January 28, 2021;
•
our board of directors’ knowledge of our business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, as well as its knowledge of the
current and prospective environment in which we operate, including economic and market conditions;
•
the risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company and being able to raise new equity capital and expand our
portfolio through acquisitions;
•
the belief that the merger is more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic alternatives available to us, including remaining as an
independent public company and listing our common stock on a national securities exchange, the feasibility of such alternatives and the
significant risks and uncertainties associated with pursuing such alternatives;
•
favorable conditions for sale transactions in the real estate markets generally and the multifamily sector specifically, including prices for real
estate assets being at or near historical highs, the low interest rate environment and the possibility that interest rates may rise in the near
future;
•
the high probability that the merger would be completed based on, among other things, Blackstone’s substantial available capital, proven
ability to complete large acquisition transactions and extensive experience in the real estate industry, the lack of a financing condition, and
the $258 million parent
36
Table of Contents
termination payment payable to us if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances (representing approximately 10.5% of our
equity value and 6.9% of our enterprise value), which payment is guaranteed by the Sponsor;
•
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which were reviewed by our board of directors with our financial and legal advisors, and
the fact that such terms were the product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties;
•
the financial analysis of Lazard presented to our board of directors and the oral opinion of Lazard rendered to our board of directors,
subsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion, dated January 23, 2022, to our board of directors, to the effect that, as of such
date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations and qualifications on
the review undertaken described in Lazard’s written opinion, the common stock merger consideration of $14.75 per share in cash to be paid
to the holders of common stock (other than holders of excluded common stock) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders (as more fully described below in the sections entitled “—Opinion of Our Financial Advisor—Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co.
LLC”);
•
our ability under the merger agreement, in response to unsolicited competing proposals, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations
with, third parties in certain circumstances;
•
the fact that the $80 million company termination payment payable by us in certain circumstances (representing approximately 3.25% of our
equity value and 2.2% of our enterprise value) was viewed by our board of directors, after consultation with our financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, as reasonable and not likely to preclude any other party from making a competing proposal;
•
our board of directors’ ability, under certain circumstances under, to (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify its recommendation that our
stockholders approve the merger proposal, subject to payment of the $80 million company termination payment if Parent elects to terminate
the merger agreement in such circumstance, or (ii) terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
the implementation of a superior proposal, subject to payment of the $80 million company termination payment; and
•
the fact that the merger would be subject to the stockholder approval, and holders of our common stock would be free to reject the merger
by voting against the merger for any reason, including if a higher offer were to be made prior to the special meeting (although we may be
required to pay the $80 million company termination payment under certain circumstances if we subsequently were to enter into a definitive
agreement relating to, or to consummate, a competing proposal).
Our board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement:
•
our inability to solicit competing proposals and the possibility that the $80 million company termination payment payable upon the
termination of the merger agreement could discourage other potential bidders from making a competing proposal to acquire the Company;
•
following the merger, we will no longer exist as an independent public company and our existing stockholders will not participate in any
future earnings or growth we might have achieved on a stand-alone basis or as a combined company;
•
the risk that an alternative transaction or different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial to our stockholders than the
proposed merger with Blackstone;
•
the merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, due to a failure of certain conditions precedent to the closing of the
merger, including the risk that our stockholders do not approve the merger proposal;
37
Table of Contents
•
if either Parent or Merger Sub fails, or threatens to fail, to satisfy its obligations under the merger agreement, we are not entitled to
specifically enforce the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter, and that our exclusive remedy, available if the merger agreement is
terminated in certain circumstances, would be limited to the $258 million parent termination payment (the payment of which is guaranteed by
the Sponsor);
•
the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking
business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the merger;
•
an all-cash merger would be taxable to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
under Maryland law, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or similar rights of an objecting stockholder in
connection with the merger;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger agreement and completing the merger and the substantial time
and effort of management required to consummate the merger and related disruptions to the operation of our business;
•
the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or the failure to complete the merger, may have
an adverse impact on our employees and our existing and prospective business relationships with third parties; and
•
some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders
generally (see “—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”).
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by our board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material factors
considered by our board of directors. In reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, our board of directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to, and did not make specific assessments
of, the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. Our board of directors did not reach any specific
conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered.
The above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contains forward-looking
statements and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”",42,45

We do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future performance due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting
financial performance for future periods and the likelihood that the

underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized. However, in connection with our evaluation of potential strategic alternatives and specifically
the merger, our management prepared certain forward-looking financial projections for the Company on a consolidated basis for fiscal years ending
December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2027 (the “Company financial projections”).
The following table summarizes the Company financial projections that were provided to our board of directors and to Lazard, and which our board of
directors directed Lazard to use and rely upon in connection with its financial analyses and opinion to our board of directors as described below in the
section entitled “ —Opinion of Our Financial Advisor.”

Net Effective Rent was calculated as gross rent less any tenant concessions.
(3)
Total Revenue was calculated as Net Effective Rent less vacancy loss, bad debt and any revenue recorded for nonrevenue units, and plus utilities
income and any other ancillary property-level income.
(4)
Net operating income (“NOI”) was calculated as Total Revenue less (a) property operating expenses, including payroll, utilities, maintenance,
landscaping, snow removal, turnover costs, marketing and property general and administrative expenses, real estate taxes, property management
fees, insurance, franchise taxes and professional fees and (b) other non-recurring and miscellaneous other expenses (i.e., major plumbing, electrical
repair, roof repair, mold remediation, tree trimming and exterior paint touch-ups).
(5)
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) was calculated as NOI less general and
administrative expenses and stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation was included as a cash expense because no share count
expansion was forecasted during the periods presented.
(6)
Unlevered Free Cash Flow was calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less certain recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and value-add capital
expenditures.
(7)
In accordance with the definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), funds from operations (“FFO”) was
calculated as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from the sale of
certain real estate assets and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly
attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity.
(8)
Management funds from operations (“MFFO”) was calculated as FFO excluding certain debt prepayment and financing costs.
In addition, the following table summarizes certain other projections provided to prospective bidders, including Blackstone, in connection with their due

Important Information About the Financial Projections
The financial projections are included solely to give our stockholders access to certain information that was made available to our board of directors,
Lazard and certain bidders, including Blackstone, and, with respect to the Company financial projections, used by Lazard in connection with its financial
analysis and fairness opinion. The financial projections have not been updated following January 21, 2022 to reflect our current views of our future
financial performance, and should not be treated as guidance with respect to projected results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 or any other
period. The financial projections are subjective in many respects and, in the case of the Company financial projections, were prepared solely for our
internal use and for Lazard for use in connection with its financial analysis and fairness opinion, and in the case of the bidder projections, were prepared
solely to assist prospective bidders in connection with their due diligence review. The financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public
disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or GAAP. Our independent registered public
accounting firm has not compiled, examined, audited, or performed any procedures with respect to the financial projections, and has not expressed any
opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this information or its achievability. The inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement
does not constitute an admission or representation by us that the information is material.
Certain of the above financial data were not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including NOI, Adjusted EBITDA, Unlevered Free Cash Flow, FFO and
MFFO. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our financial results and believe that they enhance investors’ understanding of our
financial performance and the comparability of our results to prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or
as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from others in
the industry and Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are not necessarily comparable with similar titles used by other companies.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Lazard for purposes of its opinion to our board of directors as described below
in the section entitled “—Opinion of Our Financial Advisor” or by our board of directors or Blackstone in connection with their consideration of the
merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the financial projections above.
40
Table of Contents
In the view of our management, the financial projections were prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting management’s best available estimates and
judgments regarding our future financial performance at the time they were prepared.
The financial projections, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables, estimates and assumptions that necessarily
involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult
or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond our control. The financial projections were developed under the assumption of continued
standalone operation, do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the financial projections were
prepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the merger or any effects of the merger. Further, the financial projections do not
prepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the merger or any effects of the merger. Further, the financial projections do not
take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be consummated and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. The
financial projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Given that the financial projections cover
multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. Important factors that may affect actual results and
the achievability of the financial projections include, but are not limited to, local market conditions, general economic conditions and disruptions in the
financial, debt, capital, credit or securities markets, developing industry dynamics, competition, our ability to obtain financing, development and
redevelopment costs, changes in business strategy and those risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2020, as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC. For additional information on factors that may cause our future financial
results to materially vary from the projected results summarized above, see the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements.”
The financial projections also reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based
on actual results, revised prospects for our business, changes in general business or economic conditions, certain accounting assumptions, timing of
business investments, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax or other laws or regulations or any other
transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated when the financial projections were prepared. In addition, the
financial projections may be affected by our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable period. Accordingly, actual
results will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the financial projections. The financial projections should be evaluated, if at all, in
conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in our public filings with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the
financial results in the financial projections will be realized, or that future actual financial results will not materially vary from those estimated in the
financial projections.
The inclusion of the financial projections and accompanying narrative in the tables above should not be regarded as an indication that we, Blackstone,
our or its affiliates and/or any of our or their respective officers, directors, advisors or other representatives consider the financial projections to be
necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. None of us, Blackstone, our or its affiliates nor any
of our or their respective officers, directors, advisors or other representatives gives any of our stockholders or any other person any assurance that
actual results will not differ materially from the financial projections, and we, Blackstone, our or its affiliates and/or our or their respective officers,
directors, advisors or other representatives undertake no obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the financial projections to reflect
circumstances existing after the dates on which the financial projections were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that
any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying the financial projections are shown to be in error or are no longer appropriate. Some or all of the
assumptions that have been made in connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial
projections were prepared. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the financial projections, which were prepared as of an earlier
date. None of us, our affiliates and/or our or their respective officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to
any of

our stockholders regarding our ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the financial projections or that the financial projections
will be achieved.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the financial projections, our stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any,
reliance on the financial projections.",45,49

Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC
On January 23, 2022, Lazard rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion, dated January 23, 2022, to our
board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in the
written opinion, the common stock merger consideration to be paid to the holders of common stock (other than holders of excluded common stock) in the
merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated January 23, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit B and is
hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of Lazard’s opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read Lazard’s opinion and this section carefully and in their entirety.
Lazard’s opinion was rendered to our board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger and addressed only the fairness, as of the date of
the opinion, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock (other than holders of excluded common stock) of the common stock merger
consideration to be paid to such holders in the merger. Lazard’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the merger or any matter relating thereto.
In connection with its opinion, Lazard:
•
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated January 22, 2022, of the merger agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to the Company;
•
reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to Lazard by the Company relating to the business of the Company;
•
held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company with respect to the business and prospects of the Company;
•
reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business Lazard believed to be generally relevant in
evaluating the business of the Company;
•
reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business Lazard believed to be generally
relevant in evaluating the business of the Company; and
•
conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Lazard deemed appropriate.
Lazard assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent verification of such information.
Lazard did not conduct any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or concerning
the solvency or fair value of the Company, and Lazard was not furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. With respect to the financial
42Table of Contents
forecasts utilized in Lazard’s analyses, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Company, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of the Company. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and
expressed no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based.
Lazard’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Lazard,
as of the date of the opinion. Lazard assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the
date of the opinion. Lazard’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which
the Company might have engaged or the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the merger.
In rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Company, that the merger would be consummated on the terms described in the merger
agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions. Representatives of the Company advised Lazard, and Lazard assumed,
that the merger agreement, as executed, conforms to the draft reviewed by Lazard in all material respects. Lazard also assumed, with the consent of the
Company, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third-party approvals and consents for the merger would not have an adverse effect
on the Company or the merger. Lazard did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the merger, nor did Lazard’s
opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Lazard understood that the Company had obtained such advice as it deemed
necessary from qualified professionals. Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the common stock merger
consideration to the extent expressly specified in the opinion) of the merger, including, without limitation, the convertible stock merger consideration, the
form or structure of the merger or any other agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the merger. In addition,
Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any directors,
officers or employees of any parties to the merger, or class of such persons, relative to the common stock merger consideration or otherwise.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Lazard performed certain financial analyses and reviews of certain information that Lazard deemed appropriate in
connection with rendering its opinion as summarized below. The summary of the analyses and reviews provided below is not a complete description of
the analyses and reviews underlying Lazard’s opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and review and the application of those methods to particular circumstances, and,
therefore, is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Considering selected portions of these analyses and reviews or the
summary set forth below without considering the analyses and reviews as a whole, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the analyses and
reviews underlying Lazard’s opinion. In arriving at its opinion, Lazard considered the results of all of its analyses and reviews and did not attribute any
particular weight to any particular analysis or review, or application thereof considered by it; rather, Lazard made its determination as to fairness on the
basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses and reviews.
For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Lazard considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. No company, business or transaction used in Lazard’s analyses and reviews, as a
comparison, is identical to the Company, its business or the merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely
mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and
other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions used in Lazard’s analyses and
reviews. The estimates contained in Lazard’s analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review are not
necessarily indicative of actual results or values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by Lazard’s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not
43
Table of Contents
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and
the results derived from, Lazard’s analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
Summary of Lazard Financial Analyses
The summary of the analyses and reviews provided below includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Lazard’s
analyses and reviews, the tables below must be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of Lazard’s analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full description of the analyses and
reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Lazard’s
analyses and reviews.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or
before January 21, 2022, the last trading day before the financial presentation of Lazard dated January 23, 2022, and is not necessarily indicative of current
market conditions. Lazard has been instructed by our board of directors to use the Company financial projections as a basis for its analyses.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company by calculating the estimated present value (as of June 30, 2022) of the stand-alone
unlevered, free cash flows that the Company was forecasted to generate during period from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2026 based on the
Company financial projections. Lazard also calculated a range of estimated terminal values for the Company by applying a selected range of exit
capitalization rates of 4.25% to 5.0% to the stand-alone cash NOI attributable to the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027, which range
of exit capitalization rates was selected based on Lazard’s professional judgment and experience, taking into account, among other things, current and
historical implied capitalization rates for selected comparable companies and trends in the overall economy generally and in the industries and sectors in
which the Company operates. The cash flows and range of terminal values were then discounted to present value (as of June 30, 2022) using a selected
range of discount rates of 6.5% to 8.0% derived from a weighted average cost of capital calculation utilizing the capital asset pricing model. This analysis
indicated an implied enterprise value range for the Company, from which Lazard then calculated an implied equity value range for the Company by adding
the value of the Company’s tangible other assets and subtracting the value of the Company’s tangible liabilities as of June 30, 2022, based on the
Company financial projections.
This analysis resulted in a range of implied per share equity values per share of $11.71 to $15.52, as compared to (1) the most recent published NAV of the
Company of $9.06 per share, which was determined by our board of directors as of January 28, 2021, and (2) the common stock merger consideration of
$14.75 per share.
Selected Public Companies Analysis
Lazard reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of the following six selected publicly traded companies that, given certain
business and financial characteristics, Lazard considered generally relevant for purposes of analysis.
•
Camden Property Trust
•
Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.
•
UDR, Inc.
•
Independence Realty Trust, Inc.

Table of Contents
•
NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc.
•
Centerspace
For each of the selected companies, Lazard calculated and compared, among other things, the ratio of its stock price as of January 21, 2022 to its 2022 and
2023 estimated funds from operations per share (the “FFO multiple”). Financial data for the selected companies were based on publicly available Wall
Street research analysts’ estimates. The results of this analysis are summarized in the following table:
Low
High
Median
Mean
2022 FFO Multiple
21.7x
27.8x
25.1x
24.7x
2023 FFO Multiple
20.6x
24.7x
23.2x
22.7x
Based on its professional judgment after taking into account, among other things, such observed multiples, Lazard selected a range of 2022 FFO multiples
of 23.1x to 27.1x and 2023 FFO multiples of 21.2x to 25.2x for the Company. Lazard applied such 2022 FFO multiple range and 2023 FFO multiple range
derived from the selected companies to the Company’s 2022 estimated FFO per share of the Company common stock and 2023 estimated FFO per share of
the Company common stock, respectively, each as set out in the Company financial projections. This analysis resulted in a range of implied values per
share of the Company common stock of $10.75 to $12.60 implied by the 2022 FFO multiple range and $11.65 to $13.86 implied by the 2023 FFO multiple
range, as compared to (1) the most recent published NAV of the Company of $9.06 per share, which was determined by our board of directors as of
January 28, 2021, and (2) the common stock merger consideration of $14.75.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Lazard analyzed certain publicly available information relating to certain all-cash acquisition transactions announced since April 2015 involving publicly-
traded residential real estate target companies in the United States in which the implied transaction value was greater than $1 billion. The selected
transactions are listed in the following table:

While none of the target companies in the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Company and none of the selected transactions is directly
comparable to the merger, the target companies in the selected transactions are companies with certain operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may
be considered similar to certain operations of the Company and, as such, for purposes of the analysis, the selected transactions may be considered
similar to the merger.
Using publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates, for each of the selected transactions, Lazard observed the next twelve months FFO
multiple (“NTM FFO multiple”). The results of this review are summarized in the following table:

Based on the analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected transactions and its experience and professional judgment, Lazard selected a range
of NTM FFO multiples of 20.0x to 30.0x and applied this range to the Company’s projected 2022 FFO per common share, as set out in the Company
financial projections, to calculate a range of implied per share values of $9.29 to $13.92, as compared to (1) the most recent published NAV of the
Company of $9.06 per share, which was determined by our board of directors as of January 28, 2021 and (2) the common stock merger consideration of
$14.75.
Miscellaneous
Lazard is an internationally recognized investment banking firm providing a full range of financial advisory and other services. Lazard was selected to act
as our financial advisor based on its overall qualifications, expertise and reputation in investment banking and mergers and acquisitions generally and in
the real estate industry specifically, as well as its familiarity with the business of the Company.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Lazard provided our board of directors with financial advisory services in connection with the merger, and the
Company agreed to pay Lazard the following fees: (1) quarterly advisory fees of $250,000 payable every 90 days after the date of the engagement letter;
(2) an opinion fee of $2.5 million payable upon rendering by Lazard of its written opinion to our board of directors; and (3) a sale transaction fee equal to
$15.0 million, plus an estimated incentive fee equal to approximately $10 million payable upon consummation of the merger (against which the quarterly
advisory fees and opinion fee will be credited). The Company also agreed to reimburse Lazard for certain expenses incurred in connection with Lazard’s
engagement and to indemnify Lazard and certain related persons under certain circumstances against various liabilities that may arise from or be related
to Lazard’s engagement, including certain liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws.
Lazard, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, leveraged buyouts, and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Lazard in the past has provided, currently is providing and in the future may provide certain
investment banking and financial advisory services to Blackstone and certain of its affiliates, for which it has received and may receive compensation,
including advising a portfolio company of Blackstone on capital advisory matters and several portfolio companies of Blackstone with respect to potential
sale or acquisition transactions, and, during the past two years, having advised (1) Blackstone Infrastructure Partners in its 2022 announced
contemplated investment in Invenergy and with respect to an additional matter in 2021, (2) BME Building Materials Europe in its 2021 acquisition of St.
Gobain Building Distribution, (3) Aqua Finance in its 2021 announced contemplated sale transaction and certain other advisory matters prior thereto, (4)
APG Asset Management and Blackstone in the 2021 acquisition of GCP Student Living plc, (5) Gavilan Resources in its 2021 restructuring proceedings
(and prior thereto Blackstone Energy Partners on matters related thereto), (6) Blackstone Tactical Opportunities in its 2020 investment into SUNZ
Insurance and sale of a stake in FGL Holdings, and (7) Blackstone in its 2020 sale of a stake in De Nora. The aggregate amount of fees paid to Lazard for
financial advisory services to Blackstone and its known affiliates in the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard’s opinion was between $25 and $30
million. In addition, in the ordinary course, Lazard and its affiliates and employees may trade securities of the Company, Blackstone and certain of their
respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, and
may also trade and hold securities on behalf of the Company, Blackstone and certain of their respective affiliates. The issuance of the Lazard opinion was
approved by the opinion committee of Lazard. The information disclosed in this paragraph is based upon information provided to us by Lazard.

used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and
expenses related to the financing and the merger. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the potential debt
financing would be secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned by us, certain escrows and
reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable collateral, and that such debt
financing would be conditioned on the merger being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings.
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the merger. We have agreed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide, all customary
cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in connection with the arrangement of debt financing with respect to us or our subsidiaries, or our
or our subsidiaries’ real property. For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement—Financing Cooperation” and “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Merger.”",53,54

In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to approve the merger and the merger agreement and the other proposals described above,
our stockholders should be aware that our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of our stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in reaching its decision to approve the merger and the merger agreement. These interests are discussed below.
Convertible Stock
Pursuant to our charter, shares of our convertible stock have no current stated economic value unless and until the occurrence of certain “triggering
events,” such as a listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange, the receipt by our common stockholders of a specified return or a
liquidation of the Company, when such shares of convertible stock become convertible into shares of our common stock. The consummation of the
merger will result in a triggering event, and the merger agreement accordingly provides that, at the merger effective time, each outstanding share of
convertible stock (other than excluded convertible stock), including shares held by our directors and executive officers, will be automatically cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the convertible stock merger consideration of $1,846.76 per share, less any applicable
withholding taxes. Such convertible stock merger consideration represents the amount of consideration that would have been received by the holder
thereof had such share of convertible stock been converted into shares of our common stock under the terms of our charter immediately prior to the
merger effective time. As of February 25, 2022, Alan F. Feldman, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President,
47Table of Contents
Thomas C. Elliott, our Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer, Marshall P. Hayes, our Chief Investment Officer and Senior Vice
President, and Shelle Weisbaum, our Chief Legal Officer, Senior Vice President and Secretary owned 4,200, 798, 1,398 and 600 shares of convertible stock,
respectively.
Time Vested Restricted Stock
The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of time vested restricted stock
granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, including shares held by our directors and executive officers, will automatically become fully vested and all
restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter the shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for
all purposes under the merger agreement and will only have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock merger consideration, less
any applicable withholding taxes. Additionally, in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements, but in no event later than five business
days after the merger effective time, we will pay to each holder of time vested restricted stock an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends
up to, and including, the merger effective time, less any applicable withholding taxes.
As of February 25, 2022, our directors and executive officers collectively owned 644,715 shares of time vested restricted stock, including 315,532 shares of
time vested restricted stock granted to our directors and executive officers in January 2022. The following table sets forth the number of shares of time
vested restricted stock held by our directors and executive officers as of February 25, 2022, as well as the value of those shares based on the common
stock merger consideration of $14.75 per share.

Performance Restricted Stock
The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of performance restricted stock
granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, including shares held by our executive officers, will automatically become vested assuming target-level
achievement of all applicable performance-based vesting requirements and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter the
shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will only have the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Additionally, in accordance with the

Each employment agreement has an initial term continuing until December 31, 2023 and will automatically renew for additional one-year periods thereafter,
unless either we or the applicable executive officer provides advance written notice of our or his or her intent not to renew or unless sooner terminated in
accordance with the terms thereof.
Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements, the executive officers are entitled to, among other things:
•
for each of Messrs. Feldman and Elliott and Ms. Weisbaum an annual base salary of $700,000, $500,000 and $300,000, respectively, subject

•
with respect to each calendar year during the term beginning after calendar year 2020, each executive officer will be eligible to receive
an annual long-term equity incentive award;
•
payments and benefits upon termination of employment by us without “cause” or by the executive with “good reason,” which payments
and benefits are increased or enhanced if such termination occurs within 12 months following the consummation of a “change of control”
(as such terms are defined in the applicable employment agreed), as follows:
•
upon termination of the executive officer’s employment by us without “cause” or by the executive officer with “good reason” or
termination of the executive officer’s employment by us upon expiration of the term of the employment agreement: (1) base salary

49
Table of Contents
the executive officer is entitled under any benefits plan; (2) any Incentive Bonus earned for the prior calendar year, but not yet paid;
(3) the Incentive Bonus for the calendar year in which the termination occurs, pro-rated for the amount of time the executive officer
was employed during such calendar year, assuming target-level performance; (4) any unvested time-based equity incentive awards
will immediately vest; (5) a pro-rated portion of any performance-based equity incentive awards will remain outstanding and eligible
to vest based on actual performance through the last day of the performance period, based on the number of days during the
performance period that the executive officer was employed; (6) a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times for Messrs. Feldman and
Elliott and 1.0 times for Ms. Weisbaum (or 2.0 times for Messrs. Feldman and Elliott and 1.5 times for Ms. Weisbaum in the case of a

the Incentive Bonus paid to the executive officer for the prior three calendar years preceding the year in which such termination
occurs (or, (i) if the executive officer was eligible to earn an Incentive Bonus for only two fiscal years completed prior to the date of
termination, the amount of such average Incentive Bonus deemed to have been earned, if any, for the prior two fiscal years, (ii) if the
executive officer was eligible to earn an Incentive Bonus for only one fiscal year completed prior to the date of termination, the
amount of such Incentive Bonus, if any, deemed to have been earned for such fiscal year, or (iii) if the executive officer has not been
employed long enough to be eligible to earn an Incentive Bonus, then the amount of the executive officer’s target Incentive Bonus
for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs); and (7) continued health coverage under our health plan for a period of 18
months following the date of termination; and
•
upon termination of the executive officer’s employment by us without “cause” or by the executive officer with “good reason” or
terminated by us upon expiration of the term of the applicable employment agreement, in each case, within 12 months following the
consummation of a “change in control”: all of the benefits and payments described in the bullet for termination without “cause” or
with “good reason” or termination by us upon expiration of the term of the applicable employment agreement above, except that the
lump sum payment set forth in clause (6) thereof will be equal to 3.0 times for Messrs. Feldman and Elliott and 2.0 times for Ms.
Weisbaum the sum of (A) the annual base salary then in effect plus (B) the average of the Incentive Bonus paid to the executive
officer for the prior three calendar years preceding the year in which such termination occurs.
Each employment agreement also provides that the executive officer will be subject to customary non-compete, non-solicitation and other restrictive
covenants.
The table below under the section entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits” reflects the amount of severance payments and
benefits that our executive officers would be entitled to receive under the applicable employment agreement upon termination of such executive officer’s
employment by us without “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason” following the merger.
Employee Retention/Transaction Bonuses
In recognition of the additional work that has been done and will need to be performed to successfully consummate the merger, and in order to encourage
retention of key employees through the consummation of the merger, on January 23, 2022, the compensation committee of our board of directors
approved the 2022 Employee Retention/Transaction Bonus Plan (the “Bonus Plan”) pursuant to which we will provide cash retention/transaction
bonuses to our employees, subject to continued employment with us through the closing date. The aggregate value of the awards payable to employees
under the Bonus Plan is $10,000,000. Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to pay, on or promptly following the closing date, the amounts due to
employees under the Bonus Plan upon expiration of the seven-day revocation period following the execution and delivery by the applicable participant of
a release agreement. For our executive officers, Messrs. Feldman, Elliott and Hayes and Ms. Weisbaum, the amount of the bonus will be $2,450,000,
$1,500,000, $1,500,000 and $750,000, respectively.

Indemnification of Our Directors and Executive Officers
The merger agreement provides that, during the period commencing as of the merger effective time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the merger
effective time, the Surviving Entity will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to: (1) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of our current or
former manager, director, officer and trustee (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action arising out of or
pertaining to any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Party’s capacity as a manager, director, officer or trustee arising out
of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the merger effective time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Merger Effective Time),
including such alleged acts or omissions with respect to the merger agreement, the merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this merger
agreement; and (2) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such action the expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and any expenses
incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to indemnification) of any Indemnified Party, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by law.
The parties have agreed not to terminate or modify the obligations described above regarding indemnification of indemnified persons in such a manner as
to adversely affect in any material respect such indemnified persons, and such obligations must be assumed by any successor entity to the Surviving
Entity as a result of any consolidation or merger or transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of its properties and assets.
The merger agreement also provides that, prior to the merger effective time, we will bind, effective at the merger effective time, extended coverage under
our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy by obtaining a prepaid six-year “tail”/extended period on our existing directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies (or with insurers on terms and conditions no less favorable than such policies), which prepaid policies provide such persons currently
covered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the merger effective time, for an overall additional premium not to exceed 300% of the total annual premiums at the last renewal; provided, that we will
reasonably cooperate and consult with Parent prior to the purchase of any such tail policy; provided, further, that if Parent can procure a “tail” policy on
superior terms or on equivalent terms, but at a lower price, as compared to any such policy that may be procured by us, then, subject to certain terms and
conditions, Parent may obtain such policy effective as of the merger effective time, in which case we will not obtain such policy. Additionally, Parent and
the Surviving Entity are required to fulfill and honor in all respects our obligations pursuant to specified agreements in effect as of the date of the merger
agreement between us and any indemnified party; and any indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision
set forth in our or our subsidiaries’ organizational documents as in effect on the date of the merger agreement.

advisory vote of our common stockholders as described above under the heading “Proposal 2: Advisory Compensation Proposal.”
The amounts in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date,

This figure represents the sum of (a) the amount of the applicable named executive officer’s retention bonus under the Bonus Plan and (b) with
respect to each of Messrs. Feldman and Elliott and Ms. Weisbaum, the cash severance payment and pro-rated Incentive Bonus for 2022 in
accordance with the employment agreements.
The cash severance payment, as further described above under the section entitled “—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—Employment Agreements,” is an amount equal to the sum of the named executive officer’s annual base salary then in effect, plus the
average of the Incentive Bonus paid to the named executive officer for the prior three calendar years (as adjusted for such lesser number of years
that the named executive officer has been employed by us), multiplied by (a) 3.0 for Messrs. Feldman and Elliott and (b) 2.0 times for Ms.
Weisbaum. The calculations in the table are based on each named executive officer’s 2022 annual base salary ($700,000 for Mr. Feldman, $500,000
for Mr. Elliott and $300,000 for Ms. Weisbaum) and each named executive officer’s average Incentive Bonus for the prior three years (as adjusted
for such lesser period that the executive has been employed by us) ($1,156,250 for Mr. Feldman, $843,750 for Mr. Elliott and $337,500 for Ms.
Weisbaum). The pro-rated Incentive Bonus for 2022 included in this column is $729,966, $521,404 and $250,274 for Messrs. Feldman and Elliott and
Ms. Weisbaum, respectively. The cash severance payment and pro-rated Incentive Bonus for 2022 are required to be paid in a lump sum upon
expiration of the seven-day revocation period following the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims.
The amounts included in this column with respect to bonuses under the Bonus Plan are “single trigger” benefits that will be paid promptly
following the closing date upon expiration of the seven-day revocation period following the execution and delivery by the applicable named
executive officer of a reason agreement. The amounts included in this column with respect to the cash severance payment and pro-rated Incentive
Bonus for 2022 are “double trigger” benefits (i.e., they are conditioned upon both the completion of the merger and a qualifying termination of
employment during the 12-month period following the merger).

The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to common stockholders whose shares are surrendered
in the merger in exchange for the right to receive the common stock merger consideration as described herein. This discussion is based on current law, is
for general information only and is not tax advice. This discussion is based on the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations, and administrative and judicial
interpretations thereof, each as in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change or to different interpretations, possibly with retroactive
effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. We have not requested, and do not
plan to request, any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), concerning our tax treatment or the tax treatment of the merger, and the
statements in this proxy statement are not binding on the IRS or any court. We can provide no assurance that the tax consequences contained in this
discussion will not be challenged by the IRS, or if challenged, will be sustained by a court.
This discussion does not address (1) U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes, (2) state, local or non-U.S. taxes, (3) tax reporting requirements or (4)
withholding taxes under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as FATCA). This discussion assumes that shares
of our common stock are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does not
address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances or to persons that are
subject to special tax rules and does not address the tax
53Table of Contents
consequences of the merger to holders of the time-based restricted stock or equity received as compensation. In addition, this discussion does not
address the tax treatment of special classes of common stockholders, including, for example:
•
banks and other financial institutions;
•
insurance companies;
•
regulated investment companies;
•
REITs;
•
tax-exempt entities or persons holding our common stock in a tax-deferred or tax advantaged account;
•
persons acting as nominees or otherwise not as beneficial owners;
•
mutual funds;
•
subchapter S corporations;
•
dealers in securities or currencies;
•
traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings;
•
persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
persons holding our common stock as part of a hedge or conversion transaction or as part of a “straddle” or a constructive sale;
•
U.S. expatriates;
•
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
•
holders that are subject to “applicable financial statement” rules under Section 451(b) of the Code;
•
holders who acquired our common stock as compensation;
•
holders that are properly classified as a partnership or otherwise as a pass-through entity under the Code;
•
non-U.S. governments;
•
qualified foreign pension funds, as defined in Section 897(l) of the Code;
•
qualified stockholders, as defined in Section 897(k) of the Code; and
•
“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax.
If any entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of its partners or members
generally will depend upon the status of the partner or member and the activities of the entity. If you are a partner of a partnership or a member of a limited
liability company or other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that entity is holding our common stock, you should
consult your tax advisors. Moreover, each holder should consult its tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to it of the merger in
light of its own particular situation, as well as any consequences of the merger to such holder arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.
For purposes of this section, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state or political subdivision thereof;
•
a trust (1) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and with respect to which one or more “United
States persons” (as defined under the Code) have the authority to
54
Table of Contents
control all substantial decisions, or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United
States person; or
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.
As used in this section, a “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is not a U.S. holder or an entity treated as a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not binding on the IRS. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or
that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any described herein.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RULES APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER AND DISPOSING OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND TO REITS
GENERALLY ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND COMPLEX. HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS
REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL,
STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS, AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS, IN LIGHT OF THEIR
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
Tax Treatment of the Merger
The merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a taxable sale by the Company of all of its
assets to the regarded owner of Merger Sub in return for the merger consideration and the assumption of the Company’s liabilities, followed by the
distribution of such merger consideration under Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code. We will be deemed to have distributed the merger consideration
to our stockholders in connection with the deemed liquidation. The liquidating distribution will be treated as a dividend for purposes of the dividend paid
deduction to the extent of our earnings and profits and thus will be sufficient to satisfy our requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income for
the taxable year of the merger.
Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Common Stockholders
General. The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for their shares pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (and also may be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income and other tax laws). In general, a U.S. holder of our
common stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between:
•
the amount of cash received in exchange for our common stock; and
•
the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common stock.
Gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of shares, with a block consisting of shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction.
Assuming that the shares constitute capital assets in the hands of the U.S. holders, this gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-
term capital gain or loss if at the time of the merger the shares have been held for more than one year. An individual U.S. holder will be subject to tax on
net capital gain at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20% (under current law, which as noted below may change and which change may have a
retroactive effective date). Additionally, a 3.8% Medicare unearned contribution tax will apply to any gain recognized by individuals, trusts and estates
whose income exceeds certain threshold levels. Capital gains of corporate U.S. holders generally are taxable at the regular tax rate applicable to
corporations. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized in the exchange is subject to limitations under the Code. In addition, the IRS has the authority
to prescribe, but has not yet prescribed, regulations that would apply a tax rate of 25% to a portion of capital gain realized by a non-corporate stockholder
on the sale of REIT shares that would correspond to the REIT’s “unrecaptured section 1250 gain.”

Special Rule for U.S. Holders Who Have Held our Common Stock for Less than Six Months. A U.S. holder who has held our common stock for less
than six months at the time of the merger, taking into account the holding period rules of Section 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss
on the exchange of our common stock in the merger, will be treated as recognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends
received from us, or such holder’s share of any designated retained capital gains, with respect to such shares.
Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Common Stockholders
General. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to a non-U.S. holder will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt of the
common stock merger consideration is treated as a distribution from us to our stockholders that is attributable to gain from the sale of “United States real
property interests.” The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it intends to (1) take the position that under current law a non-U.S. holder’s receipt of a
liquidating distribution from a REIT (including the receipt of cash in exchange for Company shares in the merger, which will be treated as a deemed
liquidation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is generally subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to the extent attributable to gain from the sale
of United States real property interests, and (2) issue regulations that will be effective for transactions occurring on or after June 13, 2007, clarifying this
treatment. Although legislation effectively overriding Notice 2007-55 has previously been proposed, it is not possible to say if or when any such
legislation will be enacted. As a result, the following paragraphs provide alternative discussions of the tax consequences that would arise to the extent
the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 does or does not apply. Notwithstanding the discussion in the following paragraphs, we intend to take the
position that the cash received in exchange for our common stock will be subject to tax in accordance with Notice 2007-55 as described in more detail
below. In general, the provisions governing the taxation of distributions by REITs can be less favorable to non-U.S. holders than the taxation of sales or
exchanges of REIT shares by non-U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these provisions.
Distribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests. To the extent the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and to the
extent cash received by non-U.S. holders in the merger is attributable to gain from the deemed sale of our United States real property interests (which we
expect to be a substantial portion of such cash), then such amount will be treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or
business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis. A corporate non-U.S. holder will also be subject to
the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty). In addition, 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in
the Treasury Regulations) of any such amounts paid to a non-U.S. holder will be withheld and remitted to the IRS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 does not apply, or if a non-U.S. holder has not owned more than 10% of our common stock at any time
during the one-year period ending on the date of the merger and our common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations,
on an established securities market located in the United States, the 21% withholding tax described above would not apply, and such non-U.S. holder
would instead be subject to the rules described below in the section entitled “—Taxable Sale of our Common Stock.” However, we believe that our
common stock is not regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States as of the date of this proxy statement and therefore, this
10% exception will not be applicable to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock.
Taxable Sale of our Common Stock. Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below and to the discussion of distribution of gain from the
disposition of United States real property interests above, if the merger is treated as a taxable sale of our common stock, a non-U.S. holder should not be
subject to U.S. federal income taxation on any gain or loss from the merger unless: (1) the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if an applicable income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment
maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States; (2) the non-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the merger and certain other requirements are met; or (3) such shares constitute a “United States real property interest” under FIRPTA.
56
Table of Contents
A non-U.S. holder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States will generally be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be subject to
the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described in
clause (1) of the previous paragraph.
A non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and who meets certain other
requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the merger, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. In addition, the non-
U.S. holder may be subject to applicable alternative minimum taxes.
If a non-U.S. holder’s share constitutes a United States real property interest under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by such holder in the merger will be
treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder’s common stock generally will not constitute a U.S. real property interest
if either (1) we are a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the merger effective time, or (2) both (a) that class of our shares is regularly
traded on an established securities market at the date of the merger and (b) the non-U.S. holder holds 10% or less of the total fair market value of that
class of shares at all times during the shorter of (i) the five-year period ending with the effective date of the merger and (ii) the non-U.S. holder’s holding
period for the shares. As discussed above, we believe that our common stock is not regularly traded on an established securities market as of the date of
this proxy statement and therefore the 10% exception will not apply to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock. A “qualified investment entity” includes a
REIT. Assuming we qualify as a REIT, we will be a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the merger effective time if non-U.S. holders
held directly or indirectly less than 50% in value of our common stock at all times during the five-year period ending with the merger effective time. While
we believe that we have been and currently are “domestically controlled” as of the date of this proxy statement, no assurances can be given that the
actual ownership of our shares will be sufficient for us to qualify as a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the merger effective time.
Income Tax Treaties. If a non-U.S. holder is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States, the non-U.S. holder may be able
to mitigate certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above, such as the branch profits tax. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax
advisor regarding possible relief under an applicable income tax treaty.
U.S. Withholding Tax. As described above, it is unclear whether the receipt of the common stock merger consideration by a non-U.S. holder will be
treated as a sale or exchange of our common stock or as a distribution from us that is attributable to gain from the deemed sale of our United States real
property interests in the merger. Accordingly, we intend to withhold U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in applicable
Treasury Regulations) from the portion of the common stock merger consideration that is, or is treated as, attributable to gain from the sale of United
States real property interests and paid to a non-U.S. holder unless the receipt of the common stock merger consideration by a non-U.S. holder is treated
as a sale or exchange of our common stock and we determine that we are domestically controlled at the merger effective time.
A non-U.S. holder may be entitled to a refund or credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, with respect to any amount withheld
pursuant to FIRPTA, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding withholding tax considerations.
57
Table of Contents
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, and information reporting may apply to the cash received pursuant to the exchange of our common stock
in the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a holder who:
•
in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on an
IRS Form W-9 or successor form;
•
in the case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes an applicable IRS Form W-8 or successor form; or
•
is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with other applicable rules and certification requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld under these rules may be credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability and may entitle the holder to a refund if required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Possible Legislative Changes—Possible Change in Tax Rates
This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the
date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences (including applicable tax
rates) different from those summarized above. We cannot assure you that a change in law, including the possibility of major tax legislation, possibly with
retroactive application, will not alter significantly the tax considerations (including applicable tax rates) that we describe herein. We have not sought and
do not plan to seek any ruling from the IRS, with respect to statements made and the conclusions reached in the above discussion, and there can be no
assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions.

Common Stock
At the merger effective time, each share of common stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time
(other than excluded common stock) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock
merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded common stock will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist with no
consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the merger. If we declare a dividend on our common stock to
maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under
the merger agreement, the common stock merger consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the

Convertible Stock
At the merger effective time, each share of convertible stock, or fraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective
time (other than excluded convertible stock) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
convertible stock merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded convertible stock will be automatically cancelled and will cease to
exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the merger.

rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter the shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger
agreement and will only have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock merger consideration, less any applicable withholding

Prior to the merger effective time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a paying agent reasonably acceptable to us, a cash amount that,
when taken together with available cash of the Company that deposited with the paying agent at the merger effective time, is sufficient in the aggregate
to enable the paying agent to make the payments of the merger consideration to holders of common stock and holders of convertible stock, as applicable,
outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time. At the merger effective time, Parent will deposit with the Surviving Entity cash in the amount
necessary, together with the other funds of the Surviving Entity, to make the payments to holders of time vested restricted stock and performance
restricted stock, including the common stock merger consideration and all accrued and unpaid cash dividends, as applicable, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Entity to make such payments through the Surviving Entity’s payroll as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five business days
after the merger effective time, or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
Within five business days after the merger effective time, the paying agent will (1) in accordance with, and as required by the paying agent’s customary
procedures, mail to each holder of record of book-entry shares that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, represented outstanding shares of
common stock or convertible stock, an instruction request letter, including instructions for effecting the exchange of book-entry shares for the applicable
merger consideration, and (2) subject to the requirements set forth in the merger agreement, make delivery and disbursement of the applicable merger
consideration out of the exchange fund to the holders of book-entry shares representing common stock or convertible stock, as applicable, that were
converted into the right to receive the common stock merger consideration or the convertible stock merger consideration, respectively, in each case less
any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. The exchange of book-entry shares representing common stock and
convertible stock will be effected in accordance with the paying agent’s customary procedures with respect to book-entry securities.
On or after the first anniversary of the merger effective time, the Surviving Entity will be entitled to cause the paying agent to deliver to the Surviving
Entity any funds made available by Parent to the paying agent which have not been disbursed to holders of book-entry shares, and thereafter such
holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Entity with respect to the cash amounts payable upon surrender of their book-entry shares. None of
Parent, the Surviving Entity or the paying agent or any other person will be liable to any holder of common stock or convertible stock, as applicable, for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any amounts remaining

stock or convertible stock, as applicable, immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
governmental authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest
of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.
As of the merger effective time, our stock transfer books will be closed, and thereafter, there will be no further registration of transfers of any of our
common stock or convertible stock on our records. If, after the merger effective time, book-entry shares representing common stock or convertible stock,
as applicable, are presented to the Surviving Entity for transfer, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in the merger agreement.
Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity or the paying agent (and any affiliates or designees of the foregoing) will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the merger consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the merger agreement to any person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local or foreign tax law.

Under the merger agreement, we are required, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date that this proxy statement is cleared by the SEC, in
accordance with applicable law and our governing documents, to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting
for the purpose of obtaining the stockholder approval.
We are required to, through our board of directors, recommend to holders of our common stock that they vote in favor of the merger proposal so that we
may obtain the stockholder approval of the merger proposal, include such recommendation of our board of directors in the proxy statement and solicit
and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the stockholder approval of the merger proposal by our common stockholders, except to the extent that
our board of directors has effected an adverse recommendation change, as permitted by and determined in accordance with the provisions described
below under the section entitled “—Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation.” Without the prior written consent of
Parent, (1) the approval of the merger will be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable law to be voted on by
our stockholders in connection with the merger agreement or the approval of the merger) that we will propose to be acted on by our stockholders at the
special meeting and (2) we will not submit to the vote of our stockholders any competing proposal. We will cooperate with and keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis regarding our solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the proxy statement to our
stockholders. Unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, our obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
special meeting will not be affected by an adverse recommendation change.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, after consultation with Parent, we may adjourn or postpone the special
meeting, if, on the date for which the special meeting is scheduled, we have not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of common
stock to obtain the stockholder approval, whether or not a quorum is present, to the extent required by applicable law to provide any required disclosure
to our stockholders or to the extent necessary to solicit additional proxies; provided, that, without the prior written consent of Parent, the special meeting
will not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the special meeting was originally scheduled (excluding
any adjournments or postponements required by applicable law) or more than 120 days from the record date for the special meeting.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “competing proposal” means any proposal or offer from any person or group, whether in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, relating to any:
•
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving us or one or more of our subsidiaries
representing 15% or more of our consolidated assets, taken as a whole (as determined on a book value basis, including indebtedness
secured solely by such assets);
•
sale or other disposition, by merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or any similar transaction, of any of our or our
subsidiaries’ assets representing 15% or more of our consolidated assets, taken as a whole (as determined on a book value basis, including
indebtedness secured solely by such assets);
•
issue, sale or other disposition by us or any of our subsidiaries of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, such securities)
representing 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or of the votes associated with the outstanding shares of common
stock;
•
tender offer or exchange offer in which any person or group will acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under
the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of 15% or more of the votes associated with the outstanding shares of
common stock;
•
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar type of transaction with respect to us in which any person or group,
or the direct or indirect stockholders thereof, will acquire beneficial
69Table of Contents
ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (or equity of the resulting company); or
•
transaction that is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions.
The term “competing proposal,” however, does not include (1) the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or (2)
any merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction solely among us and one or more of our wholly
owned subsidiaries or solely among our wholly owned subsidiaries.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective
subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law or pursuant to any contract to consummate and make
effective, as promptly as practicable, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including:
•
taking all actions necessary to cause the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied;
•
preparing and filing any applications, notices, registrations and requests as may be required or advisable to be filed with or submitted to
any governmental authority in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
•
obtaining all necessary or advisable actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from governmental entities or other persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the
making of all necessary or advisable registrations and filings (including filings with governmental entities, if any) and the taking of all

with respect to the merger so as to enable the closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible; and
•
executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of the merger agreement.
None of the parties, however, will have any obligation (1) to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of such party, any of its subsidiaries or their affiliates or (2) otherwise to take or commit to
take any actions that would limit the freedom of such party, its subsidiaries or their affiliates with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their
businesses, product lines or assets. Nothing in the merger agreement requires Parent or any affiliates of Parent, including Blackstone, to agree or
otherwise be required to take any action, including any action with respect to any affiliates of Parent (including Blackstone and any investment funds or
investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by, Blackstone or any portfolio company (as such term is
70Table of Contents
commonly understood in the private equity industry) or investment of Blackstone or of any such investment fund or investment vehicle), or any interest
therein (in each case other than with respect to Parent and Merger Sub and their subsidiaries (including, following the closing, the Surviving Entity and
its subsidiaries)).
Each party to the merger agreement will, and will cause their respective subsidiaries to:
•
give any notices to third parties and use, and cause each of their respective subsidiaries to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third-party consents that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement;
•
furnish to the other party the necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation
of any required applications, notices, registrations and requests as may be required or advisable to be filed with any governmental
authority; and
•
cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a governmental authority, including promptly informing the other party of such inquiry,
consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a governmental authority, and supplying each other with copies
of all material correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any governmental authority with respect to the merger
agreement.
To the extent reasonably practicable, the parties will have the right to review in advance, and each of the parties will consult the others on, all the
information relating to the other and each of their affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any governmental
authority in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except that confidential competitively
sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchange.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any person with respect
to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent, we will not, and Parent and
Merger Sub will not be obligated to, pay or commit to pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration,
make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such person. Subject to the immediately foregoing sentence, the
parties will cooperate with respect to reasonable accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.
The parties to the merger agreement and their respective representatives will give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any governmental authority in connection with the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the merger agreement, the
merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Each party to the merger agreement has agreed to give prompt notice to the other party regarding any action, lawsuit or other legal proceeding relating to
the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to keep the other parties informed on a reasonably
current basis with respect to the status thereof (including by promptly furnishing to the other parties such information relating to such action, lawsuit or
other legal proceeding as may be reasonably requested, subject to the preservation of privilege). We will give Parent the opportunity to reasonably
participate in the defense and settlement of any such action, lawsuit or other legal proceeding against us, our subsidiaries or our directors, officers or
partners relating to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, will give due consideration to Parent’s advice with
respect to such action, lawsuit or other legal proceeding and no such settlement will be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any competing proposal or inquiry (as described below), (2) immediately
terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access granted to any such person and its representatives and (3) request the return or destruction by
such person and its representatives of all non-public information concerning the us or our subsidiaries. We have further agreed that, except as permitted
by certain exceptions described below, we will not, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage, provide any non-public information to, or take any other action for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry;
•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person information in

lead to a competing proposal or requiring us to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (any such contract, an “alternative acquisition agreement”); or
•
resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, we may, directly or indirectly through one or more of our representatives, (1) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, furnish information (including non-public information) relating to us and our subsidiaries or (2) afford access to our
business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, in each case, pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality
agreement, to, any person that has made, renewed or delivered to us a bona fide written competing proposal after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the stockholder approval (that did not result from a breach of our obligations described under this section “—Restriction on Solicitation of
Competing Proposals” and in the section entitled “—Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation”) or to such person’s
representatives; provided, that:
•
our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such competing
proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal; and
•
we will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if we take any such actions and, subject to applicable law, any
non-public information concerning us or our subsidiaries that is provided to such person or its representatives that was not previously
provided to Parent or its representatives will be provided or made available to Parent promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) following
such time as it is provided or made available to such person.
If we receive a competing proposal or inquiry, we will:
•
promptly (and in any event no later than 24 hours) after receipt of such competing proposal or inquiry, advise Parent in writing of the receipt
of such competing proposal or inquiry, the identity of the person or group making such competing proposal or inquiry and the material
terms and conditions thereof, and provide to Parent copies of any such competing proposal or inquiry made in writing and any written
documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and correspondence relating thereto); and
•
keep Parent advised, on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours), of all material developments, discussions or
negotiations regarding any competing proposal or inquiry and the status
72Table of Contents
of such competing proposal or inquiry, including notifying Parent of any change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of
any competing proposal or inquiry and providing Parent copies of any written documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and
correspondence relating thereto, except that we may redact the documentation and terms and conditions of any such competing proposal or
inquiry, to the extent we determine in good faith, after consultation with our outside legal counsel, that such redactions are required by
existing contractual obligations to protect confidential information of the business or operations of the person making such competing
proposal or inquiry.
Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may, after the date of the merger agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit
us from providing such information to Parent.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “inquiry” means any inquiry, indication of interest or request for information or discussions from any person or
group that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a competing proposal.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means a written competing proposal made by any person or group (except for purposes of
this definition, the references in the definition of “competing proposal” to 15% will be replaced with 50%) that our board of directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into consideration (1) all of the terms and conditions of the
competing proposal and the merger agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent) and (2) the feasibility and certainty of consummation of
such competing proposal on the terms proposed (taking into account all legal, financial, financing, regulatory approvals, conditionality, breakup fee
provisions and other aspects of such competing proposal and conditions to consummation thereof that our board of directors deems relevant)) would
result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of common stock (solely in their capacities as
stockholders) than the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent) and is
reasonably likely to be consummated.
In addition, the merger agreement provides that we may not, nor may we permit any of our subsidiaries to, release any person from, or waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill or confidentiality provision with respect to a competing proposal or inquiry or similar
matter in any contract to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party; provided, that, if our board of directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the duties of our board
of directors under applicable law, we may grant a limited waiver of any standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit any person to make a
non-public competing proposal to our board of directors and, to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, thereafter negotiate and enter into any
transaction in connection therewith. The merger agreement also provides that neither we nor our board of directors will take any action to exempt any
person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their affiliates) from or render inapplicable the “Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit” (including by establishing or
increasing an “Excepted Holder Limit”), as such terms are defined in our charter, or any takeover statute, in each case, unless such actions are taken
concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with the provisions described in the first bullet point in the section entitled “—
Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by the Company.”

Except in the circumstances and pursuant to the procedures described below, neither our board of directors nor any committee thereof will:
•
fail to recommend to our stockholders that the stockholder approval be given or fail to include in this proxy statement its recommendation
that our common stockholders approve the merger;
73Table of Contents
•
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, its recommendation
that our common stockholders approve the merger;
•
take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer;
•
adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to or agree to adopt, approve or recommend to our stockholders any competing
proposal; or
•
authorize, cause or permit us or any of our subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.
We refer to any action in the first four bullets above as an “adverse recommendation change.”
Prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, if (1) we are not in breach of our obligations described in the section entitled “—Restriction on Solicitation of
Competing Proposals” in any material respect and under this section “—Obligation of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation” and
(2) we receive an unsolicited bona fide written competing proposal that our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a superior proposal, then our board of directors is permitted to make an adverse recommendation
change or terminate the merger agreement in accordance with its terms in order to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of such superior proposal (as described in the second bullet in the section entitled “—Termination of the Merger Agreement—
Termination by the Company,”) or both, if and only if:
•
our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel), that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law;
•
we have given Parent at least four business days prior written notice of our intention to take such actions (which notice will include the
identity of the person making such competing proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof, as well as copies of any written
proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements providing for such superior proposal);
•
during the four business day period commencing on the date of Parent’s receipt of such superior proposal notice (the “match period”), we
have negotiated, and caused our representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires
to so negotiate) to enable Parent to propose in writing revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that our board of
directors would no longer determine that such competing proposal constitutes a superior proposal or the failure to make an adverse
recommendation change and/or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement in response to such superior proposal would be inconsistent
with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law; and
•
at the end of the match period, our board of directors has considered any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing
by Parent and has determined in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the competing
proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a superior proposal and that the failure to make an adverse recommendation change
and/or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement in response to such superior proposal would continue to be inconsistent with the
duties of our board of directors under applicable Law, in each case, if the revisions proposed by Parent were given effect; provided, that, in
the event of any change to the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material
terms of such superior proposal, we will, in each case, be required to deliver to Parent an additional written notice consistent with that
described in the third bullet above and the match period will recommence (provided that any such new match period will be a period of two
business days following receipt by Parent of any such additional notice) and we will be required to comply with the bullet immediately
above and this bullet anew.

Prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, our board of directors may effect an adverse recommendation change, other than in connection with a
superior proposal, in response to an intervening event if:
•
our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect an adverse recommendation change would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law;
•
we have provided prior written notice to Parent at least four business days in advance to the effect that our board of directors has so
determined and resolved to effect such adverse recommendation change, which notice will specify and describe the facts and circumstances
relating to the applicable intervening event in reasonable detail and the factual bases for our board of directors’ determination that such
events or circumstances constitute an intervening event;
•
prior to effecting such an adverse recommendation change, we and our representations have negotiated with Parent and its representatives
in good faith during the four-business day period following Parent’s receipt of such notice (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate)
to allow Parent to propose such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement to obviate the need to effect an adverse
recommendation change in response to such intervening event; and
•
at the end of such four business day period, our board of directors determines (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside
legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement) in good faith that
the failure to make an adverse recommendation change in response to such intervening event would continue to be inconsistent with the
duties of our board of directors under applicable law if the revisions proposed by Parent were given effect.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “intervening event” means a change in circumstances or development occurring or arising after the date of the
merger agreement that materially affects the business, assets or operations of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that was not known to or
reasonably foreseeable (or, if known, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) by our board of directors prior to
the execution of the merger agreement, which change in circumstances or development becomes known to our board of directors prior to the receipt of
the stockholder approval; provided, however, that none of the following will constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been an
intervening event:
•
the receipt, existence or terms of any competing proposal, any inquiry or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof;
•
the fact that, in and of itself, we meet or exceed any internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other
financial or operating metrics for any period; or
•
any event, change, effect, development or occurrence that would fall within any of the exceptions to the definition of a “material adverse
effect.”
Nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits us, our board of directors or our representatives from:
•
taking and disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any “stop, look
and listen” communication to our stockholders pending disclosure of our position thereunder; provided, that any such disclosure does not
contain an adverse recommendation change;
•
disclosing to our stockholders any factual information regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations or the fact that a
competing proposal has been made, the identity of the person making such competing proposal or the material terms of such competing
proposal, in each case, that our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with our outside legal counsel) that

such disclosure is required under applicable law, and disclosure under this bullet will not limit or otherwise affect our or our board of
directors’ obligations (or the obligations of any committee thereof) under the merger agreement and no such disclosure will, taken by itself,
be deemed to be an adverse recommendation change; or
•
communicating in writing with any person (or its representatives) to the extent necessary to direct such person to our obligations under the
merger agreement; provided, that (1) our board of directors (or any committee thereof) will not make any adverse recommendation change,
except in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, and (2) any such statement or disclosure made by us or our board of directors
(or a committee thereof) pursuant to this bullet must be subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and that nothing in the
foregoing will be deemed to permit us or our board of directors (or any committee thereof) to effect an adverse recommendation change.

From and after the Merger Effective Time and for a period of not less than 12 months after the closing date, solely during any period of employment,
Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Entity to, provide to each of our employees who continues employment with Parent or the Surviving Entity
following the merger effective time (each, a “continuing employee”) with (1) a base salary and annual cash bonus opportunity that are each no less
favorable than the base salary and annual cash bonus opportunity, in each case, as provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the
merger effective time and (2) severance, paid-time off, qualified retirement and health insurance benefits that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, than
as provided to each such continuing employee immediately prior to the merger effective time.
Parent will ensure that, as of the merger effective time, each continuing employee receives full credit (solely for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits) for service with us (or predecessor employers to the extent we provide such past service credit)
under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, in which such employees became
participants; provided, however, that the foregoing will not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. As of the merger effective time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Entity to, credit to
continuing employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any of our applicable benefit plans as of the merger effective
time.
With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entity for the benefit of continuing employees, Parent will (1)
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of
any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan, and (2) cause each continuing employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by
such continuing employee under any similar benefit plan for the plan year that includes the merger effective time for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained
by Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, for the plan year in which the merger effective time occurs.
With respect to each benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entity in which any of our employees participate,
and except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, service with us or any of our subsidiaries and any predecessor of us or any of our
subsidiaries will be treated as service with Parent or the Surviving Entity (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable),
benefit accrual, and entitlement to benefits including vacation and severance ) (but not for accrual of or entitlement to defined benefit pension benefits
which may be in effect from time to time), to the extent such service was recognized by us as of the date of the merger agreement. Parent will, or will cause
the Surviving Entity to, credit unused vacation time credited to company employees through the merger effective time under our and our subsidiaries’
vacation time policies.

If you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of common stock in street name, your broker or bank may have sent you a notice that your
household will receive only one annual report and proxy statement for each company in which you hold shares through that broker or bank. This practice
of sending only one copy of proxy materials is known as “householding.” If you did not respond that you did not want to participate in householding,
you were deemed to have consented to the process. If the foregoing procedures apply to you, your broker has sent one copy of this proxy statement to
your address. You may revoke your consent to householding at any time by sending your name, the name of your brokerage firm and your account
number to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717 or calling (866) 540-7095. The revocation of your
consent to householding will be effective 30 days following its receipt. In any event, if you did not receive an individual copy of this proxy statement, we
will promptly send a copy to you if you address your written request to Resource REIT, Inc., 1845 Walnut Street, 17th Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

(b) such other place or date as may be agreed in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to
herein as the “Closing Date.”

executed and filed with the SDAT in accordance with the MGCL (the “Articles of Merger”) and a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger to be

the SDAT) as may be agreed between the Parties and specified in the Articles of Merger and Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the “Merger
Effective Time”).

Company prior to the Merger Effective Time: (a) the name of the Surviving Entity shall be “Rapids Merger Sub LLC”; (b) the certificate of formation of

of the Surviving Entity and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.
Section 2.7 Tax Treatment of Merger. The Parties intend that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and, where applicable, state and local income tax
purposes), the Merger shall be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of all of the Company’s assets to Merger Sub (or if Merger Sub is a disregarded
entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the regarded owner of Merger Sub) in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration to be provided to
the holders of equity interests in the Company and the assumption of all of the Company’s liabilities, followed by a distribution of such Merger
Consideration to the holders of equity interests in the Company in liquidation of the Company pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code, and

Effective Time, shall be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, an amount in cash

respect thereto in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger.
(iv) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and then held by the Parent

any right inure or be made with respect thereto in connection with or as a consequence of the Merger.
(v) Each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be unaffected

respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law.
(c) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Merger Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Convertible Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall
have occurred, then the Common Stock Consideration or the Convertible Stock Consideration, as applicable, shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to proportionally reflect such change to provide the holders thereof the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 3.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
Section 3.2 Payment Procedures.
(a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall appoint DST Systems, Inc., or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company,
to act as paying agent with respect to the Merger (the “Paying Agent”). At or prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent a cash amount in U.S. dollars that, when taken together with available cash of the Acquired Companies that is
deposited with the Paying Agent at the Merger Effective Time, is sufficient in the aggregate to enable the Paying Agent to make the payments of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) and Section 3.1(a)(ii) to holders of Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Stock, as
applicable, outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent shall make payments of the Merger
Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. Any and all interest earned on cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be
paid to the Surviving Entity.
(b) Within five Business Days after the Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall cause the Paying Agent to (i) in accordance with, and
as required by the Paying Agent’s customary procedures, mail to each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares that, immediately prior to the Merger

customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree), including instructions for effecting the exchange of
Book-Entry Shares for the applicable Merger Consideration, and (ii) subject to the requirements of this Section 3.2(b), make, and the Paying Agent shall
make, delivery and disbursement of the applicable Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund to the holders of Book-Entry Shares representing
Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Stock, as applicable, that were converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration or
the Convertible
A-14
Table of Contents
Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) and Section 3.1(a)(ii), respectively (including, with respect to the Time Vested Restricted Stock and
Performance Restricted Stock, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.3(a) and (b), respectively), in each case less any applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment as provided in Section 3.4. The exchange of Book-Entry Shares representing Company Common Stock or
Company Convertible Stock, as applicable, shall be effected in accordance with the Paying Agent’s customary procedures with respect to book-entry
securities.
(c) On or after the first anniversary of the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to cause the Paying Agent to deliver to the
Surviving Entity any funds made available by Parent to the Paying Agent which have not been disbursed to holders of Book-Entry Shares representing
Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Stock, as applicable, and thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Entity with
respect to the cash amounts payable upon surrender of their Book-Entry Shares. None of Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Stock, as applicable, for any Merger Consideration or other
amounts properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Stock, as applicable, immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.
(d) As of the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Stock on the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this Article III upon surrender of Book-Entry Shares representing Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Stock, as applicable,
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Stock, as applicable, outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law. If, after the Merger Effective Time, Book-Entry Shares representing Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Stock, as
applicable, are presented to the Surviving Entity for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.
(e) After the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Entity. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Entity. Until the termination of the Exchange Fund, to the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the cash portion of the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt
payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Entity shall promptly replace or restore the cash portion of the Exchange
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the cash portion of the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient
to make all such payments.
Section 3.3 Company Compensatory Awards.
(a) Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, each outstanding share of unvested time-based restricted Company Common Stock (“Time Vested
Restricted Stock”) granted pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan shall, automatically and without any action required on the part of the holder
thereof, become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon shall lapse, and thereafter all shares of Company Common Stock
represented thereby shall be considered outstanding for all purposes under this Agreement and shall only have the right to receive, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the Common Stock Consideration (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such vesting or payment as provided in Section 3.4). In addition, in no event later than five Business Days after the Merger
A-15
Table of Contents
Effective Time, the Company shall pay each holder of Time Vested Restricted Stock an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends up to, and
including, the Merger Effective Time (less required withholdings as provided in Section 3.4) in accordance with the terms of the applicable award
agreement.
(b) Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, each outstanding award of unvested performance-based restricted Company Common Stock
(“Performance Restricted Stock”) granted pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan shall, automatically and without any action required on the part of
the holder thereof, become vested assuming target-level achievement of all applicable performance-based vesting requirements and all restrictions and
reacquisition rights thereon shall lapse, and thereafter all shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby shall be considered outstanding for all
purposes under this Agreement and shall only have the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the
Common Stock Consideration (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting or payment as provided in Section 3.4). In
addition, in no event later than five Business Days after the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall pay each holder of Performance Restricted Stock
an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends up to, and including, the Merger Effective Time (less required withholdings as provided in
Section 3.4) in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement.
(c) At or prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.3.
(d) As of the Merger Effective Time, the Long-Term Incentive Plan shall terminate, and the Company shall ensure that following the Merger Effective
Time, no participant in the Long-Term Incentive Plan or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity
securities of the Company, the Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary thereof.
(e) At the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Surviving Entity cash in the amount necessary, together with the other funds of the
Surviving Entity, to make the payments required under this Section 3.3, including all accrued and unpaid cash dividends on Company Compensatory
Awards, as applicable, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to make the payments required under this Section 3.3 through the Surviving Entity’s
payroll as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five Business Days after the Merger Effective Time, or at such later time as necessary to
avoid a violation and/or adverse Tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. For the avoidance doubt, Parent’s obligation to deposit cash shall
include amounts sufficient to satisfy the Company’s obligation to withhold from, and pay over to applicable taxing authorities, amounts with respect to
the payments required under this Section 3.3.
Section 3.4 Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, any Parent Party, the Surviving Entity, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent (and any Affiliates or
designees of the foregoing) and any other applicable withholding agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company Convertible
Stock or Company Compensatory Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under the Code or any
other provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.
Section 3.5 Dissenters Rights. No dissenters’ or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.
Section 3.6 General Effects of the Merger. At the Merger Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as set forth in this Agreement and as provided
in the applicable provisions of the MGCL and DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Merger Effective Time,
all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Entity, and
A-16

all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

the Merger, except where the failure to make any such filing or obtain any such consent would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No vote of
Parent’s equity holders is necessary to adopt this Agreement or to approve any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Section 5.4 Available Funds.
(a) Parent has received and accepted, and has delivered to the Company, a true, correct and complete fully executed copy of the Equity Commitment
Letter from the Sponsor to invest, subject to the terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein (being referred to as the
“Equity Financing”). The Equity Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, supplemented, amended or modified, no
terms thereunder have been waived, and no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, supplement, amendment, modification or waiver is
contemplated.
(b) Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
and the performance in all material respects by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, at the Closing, the net proceeds contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letter will be sufficient for the Parent Parties and the Surviving Entity to pay all amounts required to be paid in connection with
the Merger and Equity Commitment Letter (including payment of the Merger Consideration, repayment or refinancing of debt of any Acquired Company
contemplated by this Agreement, and payment of all other fees and Expenses and obligations required to be paid or satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger and the Equity Financing).
(c) The Equity Commitment Letter is enforceable against Parent and Sponsor in accordance with its terms, in each case, except as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the parties
A-35
Table of Contents
thereto, and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach under the Equity Commitment Letter. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
and the performance in all material respects by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any
of the conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amount of the Equity
Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date. The Equity Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent and
other conditions and contingencies to the obligations of Sponsor to make the full amount of the Equity Financing available to Parent on the terms therein.
There are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (written or oral) to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related
(directly or indirectly) to the Equity Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter that could affect the conditionality,
enforceability, availability, termination or amount of the Equity Financing.
(d) The obligations of the Parent Parties under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parent’s, Merger Sub’s, their respective
Affiliates’ or any other Person’s (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any of the Acquired Companies) ability to obtain the Equity Financing or any
other financing.
Section 5.5 Solvency. Assuming (a) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving effect to
the Merger, including the Equity Financing, and the payment of the Merger Consideration, (b) any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this
Agreement, (c) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article IV hereof, (d) payment of all amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger, (e) the financial projections or forecasts provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date
hereof have been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, and (f) payment of all related fees and Expenses, then,
after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Equity Financing, each of Parent and the Surviving Entity will
be Solvent as of the Merger Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Solvent”
when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (i) the amount of the “fair saleable value” of the assets of such Person
will, as of such date, exceed (A) the value of all “liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities,” as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including the probable amount of contingent and other liabilities) as such
debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged” and “able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature”
means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.
Section 5.6 Guarantee. Parent has furnished the Company with a duly executed, accurate and complete copy of the Guarantee. The Guarantee is in full
force and effect. The Guarantee is (a) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Sponsor, and (b) enforceable in accordance with its respective terms
against the Sponsor, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law). There is no breach or default under the Guarantee by the Sponsor, and no event has occurred that would constitute a breach or default (or with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or default) thereunder by the Sponsor.
Section 5.7 Absence of Certain Agreements. As of the date hereof, none of the Parent Parties nor any of their respective controlled Affiliates has entered
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case,
A-36
Table of Contents
whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), (a) pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive, in respect of Company Common Stock, consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company has agreed to vote to adopt this
Agreement or has agreed to vote against any Superior Proposal except pursuant to the consents relating to the Convertible Stock Approval, or (b)
pursuant to which any stockholder of any Acquired Company has agreed to make an investment in, or contribution to, any of the Parent Parties in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case that would not terminate and be void concurrently with any termination
of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings (in each case, whether oral or written) between the
Parent Parties, the Sponsor or any of their respective controlled Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company’s management or the
Company Board, on the other hand, that relate in any way to, or are in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the
Parent Parties or the Sponsor (or any of their respective controlled Affiliates) has entered into any Contract with any Person prohibiting or seeking to
prohibit such Person from providing or seeking to provide debt financing to any Person in connection with a transaction involving any Acquired
Company in connection with the Merger (provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit the establishment of customary “tree”
arrangements).
Section 5.8 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no Action or investigation to which any of the Parent Parties is a party (either as plaintiff or
defendant) pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent Parties, threatened before any Governmental Authority, and, to the knowledge of the Parent
Parties, there is no basis for any such Action or investigation, in each case, that is expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
hereof, none of the Parent Parties has been permanently or temporarily enjoined by any Order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority from
engaging in or continuing to conduct the business of such Parent Party that is expected by Parent to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Section 5.9 Compliance. Each of the Parent Parties is in, and since December 31, 2019 has been in, compliance with all Laws applicable to its businesses,
except where the failure to comply with such Laws has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of
the Parent Parties has, during the past five years: (a) received any written notice from any Governmental Authority regarding any material violation by the
Parent Parties of any Law; or (b) provided any written notice to any Governmental Authority regarding any material violation by any of the Parent Parties
of any Law, which notice in either case of clauses (a) and (b) remains outstanding or unresolved as of the date hereof, except for such notices that would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Section 5.10 Brokers. No broker, investment banker or other Person that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Parent Parties is
entitled to any broker’s, finder’s or other similar fee or commission payable by the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Section 5.11 Takeover Statutes. None of the Parent Parties or, to the knowledge of the Parent Parties, any of their respective Affiliates, beneficially owns
(as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any Company Capital Stock or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for Company Capital Stock, or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Company Capital Stock, other than pursuant to this Agreement. None of the Parent
Parties or any of their Subsidiaries or the “Affiliates” or, to the knowledge of the Parent Parties, the “associates” of any such person, within the past five
years, has been an “interested stockholder” of the Company, in each case as defined in Section 3-601 of the MGCL.
Section 5.12 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied in writing on or behalf of the Parent Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the time it is first mailed to the Company’s
stockholders, at the time of any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting or at the Merger
A-37

Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
Section 5.13 No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the representations or warranties expressly set forth in this Article V or any document,
agreement, certificate or other instrument contemplated hereby, none of the Parent Parties or any other Person on behalf of a Parent Party has made any
representation or warranty, expressed or implied, with respect to the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, future operating or financial results, estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, none of the Parent Parties or any other Person on behalf of a Parent Party makes or has made any representation or warranty to the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to the Parent Parties, except for the representations and warranties made by the Parent
Parties in this Article V or any document, agreement, certificate or other instrument contemplated hereby, any oral or written information presented to the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in the course of their due diligence of the Parent Parties, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the
course of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent Parties
acknowledge and agree that none of the Company or any other Person on behalf of the Company has made or is making any representations or
warranties relating to the Acquired Companies whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by the Company in Article IV or any
document, agreement, certificate or other instrument contemplated hereby, including any implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding any Acquired Company furnished or made available to the Parent Parties or any of their respective
Representatives.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and, after approval by Parent (which shall not

Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any

comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and promptly advise Parent and Merger Sub of any oral comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement; provided that, prior to responding to any comments of the SEC, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
consult and review such response and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments on such response reasonably proposed by Parent. Prior
to filing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto,
each of Parent and Merger Sub shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement,
including promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates as may be required, or otherwise reasonably requested by the Company, to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable Law. The Proxy

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their

necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such

mailed by the Company without affording Parent a reasonable opportunity in advance for consultation and review, and the Company shall consider in
good faith any comments on such materials reasonably proposed by Parent. Nothing in this Section 7.1(b) shall limit the obligations of any Party under
Section 7.1(a). For purposes of Section 4.23, Section 5.12 and this Section 7.1, any information concerning or related to the Company, its Affiliates or the
Stockholders Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company and any information concerning or related to Parent or its Affiliates will be

(c) As promptly as practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Company Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of

Statement and solicit and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board shall
have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by and determined in accordance with Section 7.3(d); provided, however, that the
Company’s obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting shall be unconditional unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms and shall not be affected by any Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 7.1(c), if, on a date for which the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right, after
consultation with Parent, to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Stockholders Meeting to the extent required by
applicable Law to provide any required disclosure to the Company’s stockholders or to the extent necessary to solicit additional proxies (provided,
however, that, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is (i) more than 30
days after the date for which the Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable
Law) or (ii) more than 120 days from the record date for the Stockholders Meeting); provided, further, the Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or
adjourned on the date the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled if the Company shall have received proxies in respect of an aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock, which have not been withdrawn, such that Stockholder Approval would be obtained at such meeting. The Company shall
cooperate with and keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the
dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders. Without the prior written consent of Parent, (x) the approval of the Merger shall be
the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company stockholders in connection with
this Agreement or the approval of the Merger) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders
Meeting and (y) the Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Competing Proposal.

Section 7.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality.
(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to and including the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of
the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective properties, offices, books, Contracts, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent and
its Representatives (i) any information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries (including with respect to any pending or threatened Action) as
Parent may reasonably request and (ii) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant
to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws. In connection with such reasonable access to information, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to participate in meetings and telephone conferences with Parent and its Representatives prior to the
mailing of any Proxy Statement, prior to the Stockholders Meeting and at such other times as may be reasonably requested. No investigation under this
Section 7.2(a) or otherwise shall affect any of the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement or any condition to the
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies of the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not be required by this Section 7.2(a) to provide Parent or its Representatives with access to or to disclose information (A) that would
violate the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this
Agreement in the ordinary course of business in accordance with this Agreement (provided, however, that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (provided, however, that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law), or (C) that would result in a loss or waiver of any
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (provided, however, that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow
for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege, including by means of entry into a customary joint defense agreement that would alleviate the loss of such privilege) or (D) for the purpose of
allowing Parties or their respective Representatives to collect samples of soil, air, water, groundwater or building materials. Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries that may result from the requests for access,
data and information hereunder.
(b) Each Party will hold, and will cause its respective Representatives to hold, any non-public information regarding the other Party obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.2, in confidence to the
extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect pursuant to the terms thereof, notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the termination thereof.
Section 7.3 No Solicitation of Transactions; Change in Recommendation.
(a) No Solicitation. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.3, during the Interim Period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
and its and their officers and directors to, and shall direct its other Representatives to, (i) immediately cease any activities, solicitation, encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons with respect to any Competing Proposal or Inquiry, immediately terminate all physical and electronic
dataroom access granted to any such Person or its Representatives and request the return or destruction by such Person and its Representatives of all
non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) not, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
encourage, provide any non-public information to, or take any other action for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Competing Proposal or
Inquiry, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person information in
connection with or for the purpose of
A-44
Table of Contents
encouraging or facilitating, any Competing Proposal or Inquiry, (C) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or other Contract (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to a Competing
Proposal or that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such Contract, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) or (D) resolve, propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing.
(b) Superior Proposals and Other Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.3, but subject to compliance with the
other provisions of this Section 7.3, at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Company
may, directly or indirectly through one or more of its Representatives, (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish information
(including non-public information) relating to any of the Acquired Companies to or (ii) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other non-public information, or to any personnel, of any of the Acquired Companies, in each case, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, to, any Person or group of Persons that has made, renewed or delivered to the Company a bona fide written Competing Proposal after the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval (that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.3) or to such Person’s
Representatives (including potential financing sources of such Person); provided, in each case, that the actions described in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) shall be permitted only if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that such Competing Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; provided,
further, that the Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company takes any of the actions described in
this Section 7.3(b) and, subject to applicable Law, any non-public information concerning any of the Acquired Companies that is provided to such Person
or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) that was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives shall be provided or made
available to Parent promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) following such time as it is provided or made available to such Person.
(c) Notices. If the Company receives any Competing Proposal or Inquiry, then the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any event no later than 24 hours)
after receipt of such Competing Proposal or Inquiry advise Parent in writing of the receipt of such Competing Proposal or Inquiry, the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making such Competing Proposal or Inquiry and the material terms and conditions thereof, and provide to Parent copies of
any such Competing Proposal or Inquiry made in writing and any written documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and correspondence
relating thereto) and (ii) keep Parent advised, on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours), of all material developments, discussions
or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal or Inquiry and the status of such Competing Proposal or Inquiry, including notifying Parent of any
change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of any Competing Proposal or Inquiry and providing Parent copies of any written
documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements and correspondence relating thereto); provided, that the Company may redact the
documentation and terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal or Inquiry, to the extent the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such redactions are required by existing contractual obligations to protect confidential information of the
business or operations of the Person making such Competing Proposal or Inquiry. The Company agrees that none of the Acquired Companies will enter
into any confidentiality or similar agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits any Acquired Company from providing any
information required to be provided to Parent in accordance with Sections 7.3(b) and (c) within the time periods contemplated hereby.
(d) No Change in Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except as expressly permitted by Section 7.3(e), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:
(i) (A) fail to recommend to its stockholders that the Stockholder Approval be given or fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
(B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, the Board Recommendation, (C)
take any
A-45
Table of Contents
formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer, or (D) adopt, approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to or agree to adopt, approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Competing Proposal (actions described in this
clause (i) being referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”); or
(ii) authorize, cause or permit any Acquired Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
(e) Adverse Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior
to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company has not breached Section 7.3(d) or this Section 7.3(e) and has not breached the other
provisions of this Section 7.3 in any material respect and has received an unsolicited bona fide written Competing Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this Section 7.3 and that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) (Superior Proposal) to substantially concurrently enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for
the implementation of such Competing Proposal; provided, however, that the Company Board shall not take any action described in this Section 7.3(e)
unless:
(i) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the duties of the directors of the Company Board under applicable Law; and
(ii) prior to making an Adverse Recommendation Change or so terminating this Agreement, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to take such actions (which notice shall include the information with respect to such Superior Proposal that is
specified in Section 7.3(c) as well as copies of any written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements providing for such Superior Proposal,
(B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good faith during the four
Business Day period following Parent’s receipt of such notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such fourth Business Day (the “Match
Period”) (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to propose in writing revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
that the Company Board would no longer determine that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the
duties of the directors of the Company Board under applicable Law and (C) at the end of the Match Period, the Company Board shall have considered
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with the
Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the Competing Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal and
that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in response to such Superior
Proposal would continue to be inconsistent with the duties of the directors of the Company Board under applicable Law, in each case, if the revisions
proposed by Parent were given effect; provided, that, in the event of any change to the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment
of consideration) or any other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, be required to deliver to Parent an additional
written notice consistent with that described in subclause (A) above and the Match Period shall recommence (provided that any such new Match Period
shall be a period of two Business Days following receipt by Parent of any such additional notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such
second Business Day) and the Company shall be required to comply with subclauses (B) and (C) above anew.
(f) Intervening Event. Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal, at any time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with the Company’s
A-46
Table of Contents
financial advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties of the directors of the Company Board under
applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not make such an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless:
(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board has (A) so
determined and (B) resolved to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 7.3(f), which notice will specify and describe the
facts and circumstances relating to the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail and the factual bases for the Company Board’s determination
that such events or circumstances constitute an Intervening Event;
(ii) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives must have negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith during the four Business Day period following Parent’s receipt of such notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time)
on such fourth Business Day (the “Notice of Intervening Event Period”) (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to allow Parent to propose
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to obviate the need to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event; and
(iii) following the Notice of Intervening Event Period, the Company Board shall have determined (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor
and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) in good faith that the
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would continue to be inconsistent with the duties of the
directors of the Company Board under applicable Law if the revisions proposed by Parent were given effect.
(g) Certain Disclosures. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Section 7.3, nothing in this Section 7.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company, the Company Board or their Representatives from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the stockholders of the Company pending disclosure of its
position thereunder; provided, that any such disclosure does not contain an Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) disclosing to the Company’s
stockholders any factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Acquired Companies or the fact that a
Competing Proposal has been made, the identity of the Person making such Competing Proposal or the material terms of such Competing Proposal, in
each case, that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel) that such disclosure is
required under applicable Law (it being understood that disclosure under this clause (ii) shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company
or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) under this Agreement and no such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change); or (iii) communicating in writing with any Person (or the Representatives of such Person) to the extent necessary to direct
such Person to the provisions of this Section 7.3; provided, however, that (A) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, except in accordance with Section 7.3(e), and (B) any such statement or disclosure made by the Company or the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) pursuant to this sentence must be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that nothing in the foregoing
will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change.
(h) Standstills and Ownership Limits. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any Person from, or waive, amend or modify
any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill or confidentiality provision with respect to a Competing Proposal or Inquiry or similar matter in
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; provided, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent
A-47
Table of Contents
with the duties of the directors of the Company Board under applicable Law, the Company may grant a limited waiver of any standstill provision solely to
the extent necessary to permit any Person to make a non-public Competing Proposal to the Company Board and, to the extent permitted by the other
subsections of this Section 7.3, thereafter negotiate and enter into any transaction in connection therewith. The Company and the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates) from or render in applicable (i)
“Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit” (including by establishing or increasing an “Excepted Holder Limit”) in each case as such terms are defined in the
Company Governing Documents or (ii) any Takeover Statute, in each case, unless such actions are taken concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(ii).
Section 7.4 Interim Operations of Merger Sub. During the period from the date hereof through the earlier of the Merger Effective Time or the date of
termination of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement or in
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Section 7.5 Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect, the Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and none
of the Parties shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the other Parties’ consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, however, that (a) a Party may, without obtaining the other Parties’ consent, issue
such press release or make such public statement or filing as may be required by Law or Order if it is not possible to consult with the other Party before
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or so long as statements are
substantially similar to statements previously agreed by the Parties and (b) a Party will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to
communications that are (i) principally directed to employees, customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications are consistent with
previous releases, public disclosures or public statements made by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party) or (ii) relating to an
Adverse Recommendation Change or “stop-look-and-listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act, in each case, made in accordance with Section 7.3. The Parties have agreed upon the form of a press release announcing the Merger
and the execution of this Agreement, and shall make such press release no later than one Business Day following the date on which this Agreement is
signed.
Section 7.6 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.
(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and each of the Parent Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any Contract to consummate and
make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) taking all actions
necessary to cause the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied, (ii) preparing and filing any applications, notices, registrations
and requests as may be required or advisable to be filed with or submitted to any Governmental Authority in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) obtaining all necessary or advisable actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the making of all necessary or advisable registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary or advisable to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iv) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to
A-48
Table of Contents
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every
impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (v) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary or
advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement;
provided, that neither Party will have any obligation (A) to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of such Party, any of its Subsidiaries (including Subsidiaries of Parent after the Closing) or
their Affiliates or (B) otherwise to take or commit to take any actions that would limit the freedom of such Party, its Subsidiaries (including Subsidiaries of
Parent after the Closing) or their Affiliates with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their businesses, product lines or assets. Nothing in
this Section 7.6 or any other provision of this Agreement shall require Parent or any Affiliates of Parent (including Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”)) to
agree or otherwise be required to take any action, including any action with respect to any Affiliates of Parent (including Blackstone and any investment
funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by, Blackstone or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in
the private equity industry) or investment of Blackstone or of any such investment fund or investment vehicle), or any interest therein (in each case other
than with respect to the Parent Parties and their Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries)).
(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing Section 7.6(a), each of the Parties shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give)
any notices to third parties, and each of the Parties shall use, and cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third-party consents that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the Parties will, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required applications, notices, registrations and requests as may be
required or advisable to be filed with any Governmental Authority and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including promptly informing the other Party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental
Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between either Party and any Governmental
Authority with respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties or their Representatives shall have the right to review in
advance and each of the Parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the other and each of their Affiliates that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent reasonably
practicable, neither Party shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other Party the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such
meeting with such Governmental Authority.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives shall, and none of the Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be obligated to, pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or
incur any liability or other obligation to such Person. Subject to the immediately foregoing sentence, the Parties shall cooperate with respect to
reasonable accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.

Section 7.7 Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation.
(a) The Company and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties and their Representatives shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation
or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to expect that the applicable
conditions set forth in Article VIII would reasonably be expected to be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement or any remedies for any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure by the Company, the Parent Parties or their respective Representatives to provide such prompt
notice under this Section 7.7(b) shall not constitute a breach of covenant for purposes of Section 8.2(b), Section 8.3(b), Section 9.1(c)(i) (Parent
Terminating Breach), or Section 9.1(d)(i) (Company Terminating Breach).
(c) The Company and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties and their Representatives shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any Action commenced or, to such Party’s knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries, respectively, or any of its or their respective directors, officers or partners that relates to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (“Transaction Litigation”) and shall keep the other Parties informed on a reasonably current basis with
respect to the status thereof (including by promptly furnishing to the other Parties such information relating to such Actions as may be reasonably
requested, subject to the preservation of privilege). The Company and its Representatives shall give Parent the opportunity to reasonably participate in
the defense and settlement of any Transaction Litigation against the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their directors, officers or partners relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall give due consideration to Parent’s advice with respect to such Action and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Section 7.8 Other Employee Benefits.
(a) From and after the Merger Effective Time and for a period of not less than 12 months after the Closing Date, solely during any period of employment,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide to each employee of the Company who continues employment with Parent or the Surviving
Entity following the Merger Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) a base salary and annual cash bonus opportunity that are each no
less favorable than the base salary and annual cash bonus opportunity, in each case, as provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time and (ii) severance, paid-time off, qualified retirement and health insurance benefits that are not less favorable, in the aggregate,
than as provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. To the extent that the termination of employment of
some or all employees of the Company who are not Continuing Employees results in or contributes to the existence of a qualifying event under any
WARN Act following the Closing, Parent shall be responsible for all notice and payment requirements under such WARN Act.
(b) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Merger Effective Time, each Continuing Employee receives full credit (solely for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits) for service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such
past service
A-50
Table of Contents
credit) under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, in which such employees
became participants; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. As of the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity
to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the
Merger Effective Time. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entity for the benefit of Continuing
Employees, Parent shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability
requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan, and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit
under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Merger
Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Merger Effective
Time occurs.
(c) If directed by Parent in writing at least ten Business Days prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company
Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Merger Effective
Time. In the event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s)
have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and reasonable
approval by Parent).
(d) Nothing in this Section 7.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to or modification of
any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating any of its employee benefit or compensation
plans or other arrangements in accordance their terms, (iii) create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or other Person with respect to the compensation,
terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent or the Company or under any benefit
plan which Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity may maintain.
Section 7.9 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.
(a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall bind, effective at the Merger Effective Time, extended coverage under the Company’s officers’
and directors’ liability insurance policy by obtaining a prepaid six-year “tail”/extended period on the Company’s existing officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance policies (or with insurers on terms and conditions no less favorable than such policies), which prepaid policies provide such Persons currently
covered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Merger Effective Time, for an overall additional premium not to exceed 300% of the total annual premiums at the last renewal; provided, that the
Company shall reasonably cooperate and consult with Parent prior to the purchase of any such tail policy; provided, further, that if Parent can procure a
“tail” policy on superior terms or on equivalent terms, but at a lower price, as compared to any such policy that may be procured by the Company, then,
subject to Schedule 7.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent may obtain such policy effective as of the Effective Time, in which case the Company
shall not obtain such policy . The Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to) maintain such policies in full force and effect for
their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, during the period commencing as of the Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or
former manager, director, officer and trustee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (each, an “Indemnified
A-51

Party” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action to the extent such Action arises out of or pertains to
any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Party’s capacity as a manager, director, officer or trustee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Merger Effective Time), including such alleged acts or omissions with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such Action the expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and any expenses incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to indemnification) of any
Indemnified Party without the requirement of any bond or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Law, but subject to Parent’s or the
Surviving Entity’s receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Entity,
as applicable, (i) shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit or proceeding against or investigation of any Indemnified Party for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 7.9(b) without the
Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (ii) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without Parent’s or the Surviving Entity’s prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (iii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party to the extent
that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification, in
which case the Indemnified Party shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant
hereto and (iv) shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified
Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single legal action except to the extent that, on the advice of any such
Indemnified Party’s counsel, two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. Parent’s and the
Surviving Entity’s obligations under this Section 7.9(b) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Merger Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.
(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Entity to, during the period
commencing as of the Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Merger Effective Time, honor all rights to indemnification,
advancement and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time now existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties as currently provided in (i) the Company Governing Documents, and (ii) indemnification agreements between the Company and any
Indemnified Party as scheduled on Schedule 7.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. For a period of six years following the Merger Effective Time, the
governing documents of Parent and the equivalent governing or organizational documents of any applicable Subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years following the Merger Effective Time in any manner that would adversely modify
these rights, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law.
(d) If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up,
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.9.

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who are intended
third-party beneficiaries of this Section 7.9 effective following the Closing), his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving Entity. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity under this Section 7.9 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Indemnified Party unless (i) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification. Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 7.9, is intended to, shall (i) be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any Subsidiaries of the Company
or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.9 is not prior to, or in substitution for,
any such claims under any such policies or (ii) impair or limit any other rights an Indemnified Party may have to indemnification, advancement, or
exculpation pursuant to applicable Law, written agreements, or current or former Company Governing Documents.
Section 7.10 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably

Date, the Company may declare and pay a dividend on the Company Common Stock to its stockholders distributing cash in such amounts determined by
the Company in its sole discretion exercised in good faith to be required to be distributed in order for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT
for such year and to avoid to the extent reasonably possible the incurrence of income or excise Tax by the Company; provided, that the Common Stock
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of any such dividend on Company Common Stock declared or paid by the
Company pursuant to this Section 7.11.
Section 7.12 Financing and Cooperation.

requested in writing by Parent (e-mail being sufficient) in connection with the offering, arrangement, syndication, consummation or issuance of any
financing with respect to the Acquired Companies and the Company Properties effective as of or after the Merger Effective Time (the “Debt Financing”)
(provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its Affiliates),
including using commercially reasonable efforts to:
(1) upon reasonable notice, direct employees of the Company with appropriate seniority and expertise to participate in a reasonable number of meetings

actions would not adversely affect the Tax status of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be subject
to additional Taxes or otherwise suffer or incur any amounts that are not indemnified by Parent under Section 7.12(a)(iii), transfer or otherwise restructure
its ownership of existing Subsidiaries of the Company, properties or other assets, in each case, pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Company;

schedule and coordinate all inspections with the Company in accordance with Section 7.2, and (C) the Company shall be entitled to have representatives

customary indemnities and bring down certificates issued in connection with a securitization of the Debt Financing.
(ii) The Company shall have satisfied its obligations set forth in Section 7.12(a)(i) if the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to
comply with such obligations whether or not any applicable deliverables are actually obtained or provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to provide, or cause its Subsidiaries or Representatives to provide, cooperation under Section 7.12(a)(i) to the extent that it: (i)
unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the Acquired Companies; (ii) requires the Acquired Companies to incur any liability (including,
without limitation, any commitment fees and expense reimbursement) in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing (except those fees,
expenses and liabilities for which the Company is reimbursed by Parent); (iii) requires the Acquired Companies or their respective directors, trustees,

the events set out in this clause (vi)); (vii) requires the Acquired Companies to take any action that is prohibited or restricted by, or would conflict with or
violate, its organizational documents, or would result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any Material Contract to which any of the Acquired

or any applicable Laws; (viii) would result in any officer or director of the Acquired Companies incurring personal liability with respect to any matter
relating to the Debt Financing or requires any officer, director or other Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate
that such officer, director or other Representative reasonably believes, in good faith, contains any untrue certifications or (ix) requires the Acquired
Companies or their Representatives, as applicable, to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be in breach of this
Agreement because of the failure to deliver any financial or other information that (A) is not currently readily available to the Acquired Companies on the
date hereof and is not otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of business of Acquired Companies at the time requested by Parent or (B) for the failure
to obtain review of any financial or other information by its accountants after using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the same. In no event shall
the Acquired Companies be required to pay any commitment or other fee or give an indemnity or incur any liability (including due to any act or omission
by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives) or expense (including legal and accounting expenses) in
connection with assisting Parent and Merger Sub in arranging the Debt Financing or as a result of any information provided by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Merger Effective Time (except
those fees, expenses, financial commitments or other financial obligations for which the Company is reimbursed by Parent). None of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the actions
taken by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives at the request of Parent pursuant to Section 7.12. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 7.12(a)(ii) represent the sole obligation of
the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates with respect to cooperation in connection with the Debt Financing.
(iii) Parent shall reimburse the Acquired Companies promptly upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ and accountants’ fees) (other than in respect of the preparation of customary historical financials) incurred by the Acquired Companies and its
Representatives in connection with the cooperation under Section 7.12, any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to Section 7.12
(including the dissolution and termination of any subsidiaries formed and documentation entered into pursuant to Section 7.12), and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Acquired Companies and their Representatives and each of the Acquired Companies’ and their Representatives’ respective present
and former directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the “Financing Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all out-of-pocket costs,
expenses, losses, damages, claims, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements, awards and liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement and consummation of the Debt Financing and any information used in connection therewith (other than the information
provided in writing by the Company or the other Acquired Companies to Parent specifically in connection with their obligations pursuant to Section
7.12(a)). The provisions of this Section 7.12(a)(iii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the foregoing Financing
Indemnified Parties. This Section 7.12(a)(iii) shall survive the termination of this Agreement (and in the event the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation under Section 7.12, and not previously reimbursed).
(iv) All confidential information regarding the Acquired Companies obtained by the Parent Parties and their respective Affiliates and Representatives
pursuant to Section 7.12 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, without the prior
written consent of the Company, in no event will Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will be deemed to include
each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub) enter into any agreement, arrangement or any other understanding, whether written or oral, with any
potential source of Debt Financing that would reasonably be expected to limit, restrict, restrain, otherwise impair in any manner, directly or indirectly, the
ability of such source of Debt Financing to provide Debt Financing or other assistance to any other party in any other transaction involving the
Acquired Company (provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit the establishment of customary “tree” arrangements).
A-56
Table of Contents
(v) Prior to the Closing Date, upon the request of the Company, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. The Parent Parties acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a condition to Closing
and that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be conditioned on, or delayed or postponed as a result of the
obtaining (or the failure to obtain) the Debt Financing.
(b) Cooperation Regarding Assumed Indebtedness.
(i) Promptly following Parent’s request, the applicable Acquired Company shall deliver to each of the lenders or any agent or trustee acting on their behalf
(each, an “Existing Lender”) under certain Indebtedness identified by Parent (the “Assumed Indebtedness”), a notice prepared by Parent, in form and
substance reasonably approved by the Company, requesting that such Existing Lender deliver to Parent and the applicable Acquired Company a written
statement or documents (the “Assumption Documents”) (A) confirming (1) the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness outstanding under such
Assumed Indebtedness, (2) the date to which interest and principal has been paid in respect of such Assumed Indebtedness, and (3) the amount of any
escrows being held by such Existing Lender in respect of such Assumed Indebtedness; and (B) consenting to the assumption of the existing
indebtedness, the replacement of any guaranty and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to
the modifications of the terms of such Assumed Indebtedness that Parent may reasonably request after the date hereof; provided that the Company shall
be informed of any such request or modification; provided, further, that, in the event Parent requests Assumption Documents in accordance with this
Section 7.12(b), (x) the consummation of the Merger shall not be conditioned on, or delayed or postponed as a result of the receipt of (or failure to
receive) such Assumption Documents from all or any portion of the Existing Lenders and (y) the Assumption Documents will be effective as of or
immediately prior to and conditioned on the occurrence of the Merger Effective Time.
(ii) Parent shall pay all fees and expenses payable in connection with the Assumption Documents, including premiums for any endorsements to or re-date
of the title insurance policy previously issued to the Existing Lenders, servicing fees, rating agency fees, assignment and assumption fees, attorneys’
fees and disbursements and processing fees required to be paid to the Existing Lenders as a condition to issuance of the Assumption Documents. None
of the Acquired Companies shall be obligated to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection with
this Section 7.12(b) prior to the Closing, and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Companies for any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with their actions and cooperation pursuant
to this Section 7.12(b). The Company’s obligations pursuant to this Section 7.12(b) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.12(a)(ii).
Section 7.13 Takeover Statutes. The Parties shall (a) take all action reasonably necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, take all action reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute or the
restrictions in the Company Charter (including the “Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit” or the “Common Stock Ownership Limit” in each case as such
terms are defined in the Company Charter) (“Charter Restrictions”) on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than the Parent Parties or their respective Affiliates) from, or render inapplicable, any
Takeover Statute of any jurisdiction or Charter Restrictions that may purport to be applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or otherwise cause any restrictions in any Takeover Statute or Charter Restrictions not to apply to any such Person.

connection with the Paying Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall pay the Transfer Taxes incurred in

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) (Outside Date) (and at the time of such termination the
Company would not have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii) (Parent Failure to Close)) or Section 9.1(b)(iii) (Failure
to Obtain Stockholder Approval), or by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i) (Company Terminating Breach), (B) a Competing Proposal shall have been
received by the Company or its Representatives or any Person shall have publicly proposed or made (or publicly announced an intention, whether or not
conditional, to make) a Competing Proposal (and, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii), such Competing Proposal or publicly

12 months following such termination, the Company enters into a definitive written agreement providing for the implementation of any Competing
Proposal or any Competing Proposal is consummated (provided, that for purposes of this Section 9.3(b)(iii), the term “Competing Proposal” will have the

such Competing Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this Section 9.3(b) shall be payable only once with
respect to Section 9.3(b), and not in duplication, even though such payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof. In the event that
Parent shall receive full payment of the Company Termination Payment pursuant to this Section 9.3(b), the receipt of the Company Termination Payment
(and the costs and expenses contemplated by the following sentence) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and shall be the Parent Parties’ sole and

fails to pay the Company Termination Payment when due and any Parent Party commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment
against the Company for the Company Termination Payment or any portion thereof, then the Company shall pay the Parent Parties their costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Company Termination
Payment at the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) (Parent Terminating Breach); or
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii) (Failure to Close);
then Parent shall pay, as directed by the Company, the Parent Termination Payment by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by the
Company within three Business Day following such termination in accordance with this Section 9.3. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by
Parent under this Section 9.3(c) shall be payable only once with respect to Section 9.3(c), and not in duplication, even though such payment may be
payable under one or more provisions hereof. In the event that the Company shall receive full payment of the Parent Termination Payment pursuant to
this Section 9.3(c), the receipt of the Parent Termination Payment (and the costs and expenses contemplated by the following sentence) shall be deemed

or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and, except for the amounts payable or reimbursable by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.12(a)(iii), Section 7.12(b)(ii) and the last sentence of Section 7.19 (collectively, the “Parent Expenses”) and the last sentence

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Action against the Parent Parties or their respective
Affiliates or Representatives for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. If Parent fails to pay
the Parent Termination Payment and/or any Parent Expenses and the Company commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment
against Parent for the Parent Termination Payment and/or any Parent Expenses, or any portions thereof, then Parent shall pay the Company in accordance
with Section 9.4, its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the Parent Termination Payment and/or the Parent Expenses at the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, without compounding) (the “Recovery Costs”).
(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that neither Company Termination Payment nor the Parent Termination Payment is intended to be a penalty but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the
Company Termination Payment or Parent Termination Payment is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the

Section 10.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions contemplated
by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
Section 10.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall be
deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
(by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail
in portable document form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have
the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.
Section 10.5 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (including the Exhibits, Schedules and the Company Disclosure Letter), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and (b) except for the provisions of Section 7.9 (which, from and after
the Merger Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties), are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto
any rights or remedies.
Section 10.6 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set
forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to
the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance by the other Party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.
The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.
Section 10.7 Governing Law; Venue.
(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Maryland without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles (whether the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland).
(b) All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Maryland
and/or the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (the “Chosen Courts”). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, for the purpose of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party, (ii)
agrees not to commence any such dispute except in the Chosen Courts, (iii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such dispute may be heard and
determined in any of the Chosen Courts, (iv) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the
A-69
Table of Contents
laying of venue of any such dispute, (v) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
dispute, and (vi) agrees, with respect to any Action filed in a Maryland state court, to jointly request an assignment to the Maryland Business and
Technology Case Management Program. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such dispute shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.
Section 10.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties; provided that, prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders, each of Parent and Merger Sub may assign any of their rights hereunder to any Affiliate of
Parent without the prior written consent of the Company, but no such assignment (x) shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder or (y) impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the first sentence of this Section 10.8,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 10.8 shall be null and void.
Section 10.9 Obligations of Parent. Prior to Closing, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply in all respects with each of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As a material inducement to the Company’s willingness to enter into this
Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, prior to Closing, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full performance and payment by Merger
Sub of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed by Merger Sub under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any
such breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of
Merger Sub shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue
any and all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent and Merger Sub in
the first instance.
Section 10.10 Specific Performance; Parent Liability Cap.
(a) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the
Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Company, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy for any such harm. The Parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.1 and
any dispute over the right to termination has been finally resolved, (i) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court
of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 10.7 to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity or pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and without that right, the Parent Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. The Company agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that the Parent Parties have an adequate remedy at
Law or that any such injunction or award of specific performance or other equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy for any reason. It is explicitly
agreed that the Company shall not have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s
and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger or otherwise to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the
terms hereof. It is further explicitly agreed that the Company’s sole and
A-70
Table of Contents
exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise shall be to seek recovery of the Parent Termination
Payment, in the circumstances in which it is payable in accordance with Section 9.3(c), and the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any
breach of Section 7.2(b).
(b) The Parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 10.10, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall in any respect
waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to them under or in connection with this Agreement (including monetary damages) for
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for
in this Section 10.10 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 10.10 shall require the Parent Parties to
institute any Action for (or limit any Parent Party’s right to institute any Action for) specific performance under this Section 10.10 prior or as a condition
to exercising any termination right under Article IX (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Action pursuant
to this Section 10.10 or anything set forth in this Section 10.10 restrict or limit any Parent Party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of Article IX or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time. In any Action seeking monetary damages
against a Party or to compel the Company to specifically perform its obligations hereunder, the non-prevailing Party in such Action (after a final, non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) shall promptly reimburse the prevailing Party its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) in connection with such Action.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Parties, together, for monetary damages,
losses, costs or expenses of the Company or its Affiliates in connection with the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated, a breach of this Agreement by any Parent Party or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the Parent Termination Payment, plus the Recovery Costs (collectively, the “Parent Liability Cap”). In no
event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates seek or permit to be sought on their behalf any amount in excess of the Parent Liability Cap from the
Parent Related Persons in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any other document, or
any theory of law or equity (including by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil) or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
The Company agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no liability shall attach to, any of the Parent Related Persons (other than against the
Parent Parties as provided by Section 9.3 and this Section 10.10), through Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub against any Parent
Related Person, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract, tort
or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the Sponsor (but not any other Parent Related Person) under and to the extent provided in the
Guarantee and subject to the Parent Liability Cap and the other limitations described herein. Recourse against Sponsor under the Guarantee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against Sponsor and any other Parent Related Persons (other than the Parent Parties to the
extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement) in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Without
limiting the rights of the Company against the Parent Parties hereunder and Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. under the Confidentiality Agreement,
in no event shall the Company or its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover damages from, any Parent Related Person (other than Sponsor to the extent provided in the Guarantee and subject to the Parent Liability Cap and
the other limitations described therein). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Section 9.3 or this
Section 10.10 shall limit the remedies of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement.

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS

“Excluded Holders”), will be converted into the right to receive $14.75 in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are
more fully set forth in the Agreement.
