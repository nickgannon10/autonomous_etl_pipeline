Only the Company’s stockholders of record at the close of business on January 23, 2023, the record date for the special meeting, will be entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof. As of the close of business on January 19, 2023, the
latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement, there were 75,541,300 shares of Company common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote. Each Company stockholder is entitled to one vote per share of Company common stock held by such stockholder on the record date on each
of the proposals presented in this proxy statement.
The approval of the proposal of the Company’s stockholders to adopt the merger agreement (the “merger agreement proposal”) requires the
affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on the matter
(the “Company stockholder approval”). Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the
consummation of the merger. The approval of the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the

compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including consummation of the merger (the “advisory compensation proposal”) requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a
majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting. The approval of the proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting,
if necessary or appropriate, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the special meeting to adopt the merger
agreement (the “adjournment proposal”) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting
(whether or not a quorum is present). Neither approval of the advisory compensation proposal nor approval of the adjournment proposal is a
condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the
advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa.

On December 11, 2022, in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, the Company’s directors, solely in their capacity as stockholders of
the Company (in such capacity, the “covered stockholders”), entered into a voting agreement with Parent and the Company (the “voting
agreement”), a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. Under the voting agreement, the covered stockholders have agreed to
vote their shares of Company common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and certain other matters. As of January 19, 2023, the
covered stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,430,474 shares of Company common stock, or approximately 1.9% of the then-
outstanding shares of Company common stock. For more information regarding the voting agreement, see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Voting Agreement”.
In addition, as of January 19, 2023, the non-director executive officers of the Company, who are not party to the voting agreement, beneficially
owned an aggregate of 144,327 shares of Company common stock, or approximately 0.2% of the then-outstanding shares of Company common
stock. We currently expect that all directors and executive officers of the Company, including non-director executive officers who are not party to the
voting agreement, will vote their shares of Company common stock “FOR” each of the proposals to be presented at the special meeting. For more

On December 11, 2022, the Company entered into the merger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, providing for, among other things and on the
terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, the acquisition of the Company by Parent at a price of $81.00 in cash, without interest,
per share of Company common stock issued and outstanding (the “merger consideration”). On the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger
agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “merger”), with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the “surviving corporation”). A copy of the merger agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy statement. If the merger is
completed, following the completion of the merger, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.
If the merger is consummated, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time the merger is
consummated (the “effective time”) will be canceled and converted automatically into, and will thereafter represent only, the right to receive $81.00 in
cash, without interest, other than shares of Company common stock that are (1) owned by the Company as treasury stock or held by Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time, which will be canceled and will cease to exist and no consideration will

pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, Section 262 (“Section 262”) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) (the “appraisal

Parent and the Company have agreed to cooperate with each other to cause the Company common stock to be delisted from Nasdaq and
deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective
time, and, accordingly, the Company common stock will no longer be publicly traded.

The Board has reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by

agreement advisable, (3) directed that the Company submit the adoption of the merger agreement to a vote of Company stockholders in accordance
with the terms of the merger agreement and (4) resolved to recommend that Company stockholders adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, the

proposal, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger”.

The Company retained Qatalyst Partners LP (“Qatalyst Partners”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential transaction such as
the merger and to evaluate whether the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement
by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. The Company selected Qatalyst Partners to act as the Company’s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners’ long-standing relationship
with the Company as well as Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and
the industry in which it operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the

that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the

point of view, of the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of
shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the
merger. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company common stock should vote with respect to the merger
or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company common stock will trade or otherwise be transferable at any

In the event that the Company stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, the Company’s

The receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, if you are a holder of Company common stock who is a U.S. holder (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), you will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between
the amount of cash you receive in the merger and your adjusted tax basis in your shares of Company common stock converted into cash in the
merger. If you are a holder of Company common stock who is a non-U.S. holder (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the merger will generally not be taxable to you under U.S. federal income
tax laws unless you have certain connections to the United States or the Company stock constitutes a USRPI (as defined below in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) and certain other conditions are met.
You should read the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” for a
more complete discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. You should consult your own tax advisor for a full
understanding of how the merger will affect your federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. taxes.

Three purported Company stockholders have filed complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Northern California and the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the merger: Bharat Hedge v. Coupa Software Inc., et al., No. 3:23-cv-
00181 (N.D. Cal. filed Jan. 13, 2023); Ryan O’Dell v. Coupa Software Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-00329 (S.D.N.Y. filed Jan. 13, 2023); and Douglas Popejoy
v. Coupa Software Inc., et al., No. 3:23-cv-00209 (N.D. Cal. filed Jan. 18, 2023). The complaints name the Company and its directors as defendants,
and allege, among other things, that the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement that is materially misleading in violation of Section 14(a) and
20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaints seek, among other relief, an injunction preventing the defendants from consummating the merger unless
additional disclosures are made, rescission of the merger in the event the merger is consummated or awarding of rescissory damages, relief directing
the defendants to account to plaintiffs for all damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations, and an award of costs and disbursements,
including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses.

The obligations of the parties to effect the merger are subject to, among other things, the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to
the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) having been terminated or expired, and
the receipt of antitrust approvals in Germany, Austria, and South Africa. Both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report
Forms with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) on December 21, 2022.
The waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act expired on January 20, 2023. The Company and Parent also
made the required filings with Germany, Austria, and South Africa. The Company and Parent have obtained clearance for the consummation of the
merger in Germany and Austria on January 10, 2023 and January 20, 2023, respectively.
The merger agreement includes covenants obligating each of the parties to use reasonable best efforts to cause the closing conditions to be

Appraisal Rights",19,19
Coupa Software Inc_20230123_DEFM14A_20571922_4573621.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
(page 33)
If the merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the merger consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Company
common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair
value of their shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Delaware Court”), together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be
the fair value. The “fair value” of your shares of Company common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same
as, the merger consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the merger agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”.
This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Company common stock
following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their
shares of Company common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is
required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal
rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to
consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.

time and place of the new meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by which Company stockholders and proxy holders may be
deemed to be present and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the special meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If,
however, the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, we will
provide a notice of the adjourned meeting to each Company stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting. In the event that a
quorum is not present at the special meeting, or if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting,
the special meeting may be postponed or adjourned to solicit additional proxies.
 
Q:
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?
 
A:
The approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of outstanding
shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on the matter. Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such required
vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to
approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa. Abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to
authorize a proxy to vote on a Company stockholder’s behalf) and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger
agreement proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on
such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to
authorize a proxy to vote on a Company stockholder’s behalf) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory
compensation proposal.
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal
at the special meeting. Abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Company stockholder’s behalf) and
broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal, regardless of whether a quorum is present at the special
meeting. The Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger agreement proposal is approved at the special meeting.
A broker “non-vote” occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal
because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the
beneficial owner, but does have discretionary voting power over other “routine” items and submits votes for those matters. The Company
does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide
such organization with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine”, whereas each of the proposals to be
presented at the special meeting is considered “non-routine”. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be permitted to vote your
shares of Company common stock at the special meeting without receiving instructions.

Q:
How do the Company’s directors and executive officers intend to vote?
 
A:
Pursuant to the voting agreement, the Company’s directors, solely in their capacity as stockholders of the Company, have agreed, among other
things and subject to certain conditions, to vote their shares of Company common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and
certain other matters. A fuller discussion may be found in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Voting Agreement”. As of January
19, 2023, the directors and executive officers of the Company, including non-director executive officers who are not party to the voting
agreement, beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,584,775 shares of Company common stock, or approximately 2.1% of the outstanding shares
of Company common stock as of January 19, 2023. We currently expect that all directors and executive officers of the Company, including non-
director executive officers who are not party to the voting agreement, will vote their shares of Company common stock “FOR” each of the
proposals to be presented at the special meeting. For more information regarding the voting agreement and security ownership of directors and
executive officers of the Company, see the sections of this proxy statement entitled “The Voting Agreement” and “Security Ownership of
Certain Beneficial Owners and Management”.
 
Q:
Do any of the Company’s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, my
interests as a Company stockholder?
 
A:
In considering the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting of Company stockholders, you should be aware that the Company’s
directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a Company
stockholder. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to authorize and approve
the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and to recommend that Company stockholders approve the merger agreement
proposal. These interests may include:
 
•
the treatment of Company equity awards, including those held by an executive officer or director, and the Company ESPP, in
which executive officers participate, provided for under the merger agreement (as described below in “The Merger Agreement—
Treatment of Company Equity Awards” and “The Merger Agreement—Company ESPP”);
 
•
eligibility of our executive officers to receive severance and other benefits payable in the case of certain qualifying terminations of
employment under the terms of individual severance and change in control agreements; and
 
•
continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement, the organizational documents of the Company
and its subsidiaries and indemnification agreements the Company and any of its subsidiaries has entered into with each of its
directors and executive officers.
These interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”. 
 
Q:
What will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the merger?
 
A:
Each Company equity award will be treated as follows:
 
•
each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, vested (including any Company Option that vests automatically solely as a
result of the merger) and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock for which such vested
Company Option has not then been exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share
exercise price of such vested Company Option, except that any

Table of Contents
vested Company Option with a per share price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will, as of the effective
time, be canceled for no consideration;
 
•
each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will
be canceled and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company
common stock for which such unvested Company Option has not then been exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the
merger consideration over the per share exercise price of such unvested Company Option, which cash amount will continue to
vest on substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the replaced Company Option, subject to the holder’s
continued employment with Parent and its affiliates (including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries), except that any
Company Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will, as of the effective
time, be canceled for no consideration;
 
•
each Company RSU that is unexpired, unsettled and vested (including any Company RSU that vests automatically solely as a
result of the merger) and a portion of certain Company RSUs that would have vested on or prior to January 31, 2024 (as described
below under “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity Awards”), in each case, outstanding as of immediately prior
to the effective time, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the number
of shares of Company common stock subject to such vested or deemed vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the
effective time, multiplied by the merger consideration;
 
•
each Company RSU that remains unexpired, unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than
any deemed vested Company RSU) will be canceled and replaced with an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of
shares of Company common stock subject to such unvested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the effective time,
multiplied by the merger consideration, which cash amount will continue to vest on substantially the same terms and conditions
as applied to the replaced unvested Company RSU, subject to the holder’s continued employment with Parent and its affiliates
(including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries); and
 
•
each Company PSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (or as otherwise
described below under The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity Awards”), will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such
Company PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time (with such number of shares generally determined by deeming the
applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of target performance and actual performance, with actual performance
determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement), multiplied by the merger consideration, except that
each Company PSU granted to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer on July 28, 2022. will be canceled in exchange for no
consideration in accordance with its terms.
With respect to the awards described above, the payments described above will be made subject to any applicable withholding taxes.
Payments in respect of vested or deemed vested Company equity awards described above will be made promptly following the effective time
(and in no event later than the first payroll date that occurs more than five business days following the effective time). Payments in respect of
cash replacement amounts described above will be made no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that occurs more than five
business days following the date on which such amount vests.
See “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity Awards”. 
 
Q:
What will happen to my participation in the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan?
 
A:
If the effective time occurs prior to the end of any outstanding offering period in existence under the Company ESPP as of December 11, 2022,
all outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP will
 
 
20
Notice and Proxy Statement
Coupa Software Incorporated
Table of Contents
automatically be exercised, in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, no later than five business days prior to the effective time and
the Company ESPP will terminate at such time. Each share of Company common stock purchased on the final exercise date will be canceled at
the effective time and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration in the same manner as other Company stockholders (less
applicable tax withholding).
 
Q:
What happens if I transfer my Company common stock before the special meeting?
 
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you own Company common stock on the record date
and transfer your shares after the record date but prior to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares of Company
common stock at the special meeting. However, the right to receive the merger consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred
your shares of Company common stock.
 
Q:
How do I vote if I am a Company stockholder of record or hold my shares in “street name”?
 
A:
If you are a Company stockholder of record, you may vote in advance by authorizing a proxy for the special meeting by completing, signing,
dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided or by granting your proxy electronically over the internet or
by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). You may also vote by attending the virtual special meeting and
voting during the live webcast.
If your shares of Company common stock are held in a stock brokerage account by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the
beneficial owner of shares held in “street name”, and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee
that is considered the Company stockholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker
or other nominee on how to vote your shares via the internet or by phone if the bank, broker or other nominee offers these options to you or
by completing, dating, signing and returning a voting instruction form by mail. Your bank, broker or other nominee will send you instructions
on how to submit your voting instructions for your shares of Company common stock. To vote at the virtual special meeting, which will have
the same effect as revoking any previously submitted voting instructions, you will need to obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other
nominee and register in advance. Please see “The Special Meeting—Registering for the Special Meeting” for information on how to register
in advance.
For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special
Meeting—Voting Procedures”. 
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we urge you to vote now to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend
the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast if you have already voted by proxy.
 
Q:
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?
 
A:
The approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of outstanding
shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on the matter. If you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual
special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, the effect will be that the shares of Company common
stock that you own will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger agreement proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger
agreement proposal.
The approval of each of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by
proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or
vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to
 
 
Coupa Software Incorporated
Notice and Proxy Statement
21
Table of Contents
instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote, it will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. Abstentions will not be
considered votes cast and therefore, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory compensation proposal
or the adjournment proposal.
 
Q:
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?
 
A:
Yes. For the Company stockholders of record, any time after you have submitted a proxy and before the proxy is exercised, you may revoke or
change your vote in one of four ways:
 
•
you may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) in accordance with the
instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting—Voting Procedures”;
 
•
you may submit a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 
•
you may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company’s Corporate Secretary at Coupa Software Incorporated, 1855 S.
Grant Street, San Mateo, CA 94402; or
 
•
you may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in
itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.
Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should
ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the
special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name”, you will need to revoke or resubmit your proxy through your broker, bank or other nominee and in
accordance with its procedures. If your broker, bank or other nominee allows you to submit a proxy via the internet or by telephone, you may
be able to change your vote by submitting a new proxy via the internet or by telephone (or by mail). To vote at the virtual special meeting,
which will have the same effect as revoking any previously submitted voting instructions, you will need to obtain a legal proxy from your bank,
broker or other nominee and register in advance. Please see “The Special Meeting—Registering for the Special Meeting” for information on
how to register in advance.
 
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement or multiple proxy or voting instruction
cards. For example, if you hold your Company common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting
instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold Company common stock. Please submit each proxy and voting instruction card
that you receive to ensure that all of your shares of Company common stock are voted.
 
Q:
If I hold my Company common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
 
A:
No. Parent will designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent for the payment of the merger
consideration in accordance with the merger agreement. At or prior to the effective time, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with the
paying agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration. Promptly after the effective time, and in any event not
later than the fifth business day after the effective time, Parent and the surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder
of record of Company common stock entitled to the merger consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions advising such Company
stockholder how to surrender its certificates representing shares of Company common stock or shares of Company common stock held in
book-entry form in exchange for the merger consideration. Each holder of Company common stock will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration on surrender of such certificates or book-entry shares for cancelation to the paying agent, together with the associated letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly
 
 
22
Notice and Proxy Statement
Coupa Software Incorporated

executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the paying
agent. You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the
paying agent without a letter of transmittal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Payment for Stock”.
 
Q:
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my Company common stock?
 
A:
Yes. Company stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL so long as they take certain actions and meet certain
conditions, including that they do not vote (in person or by proxy) in favor of the merger agreement proposal. For more information regarding
appraisal rights, see “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”. Failure to strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL may result in your waiver of, or
inability to exercise, appraisal rights.
 
Q:
When is the merger expected to be consummated?
 
A:
We currently expect to consummate the merger during the first half of 2023, subject to receipt of the Company stockholder approval and the
required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger described in the merger agreement.
 
Q:
What effect will the merger have on the Company?
 
A:
If the merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and the Company have agreed to cooperate with each other to cause the Company common stock to be
delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time, and,
accordingly, following the consummation of the merger, the Company common stock will no longer be publicly traded.
 
Q:
What happens if the merger is not consummated?
 
A:
In the event that the Company stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, Company
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Company common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will
remain an independent public company, the Company common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, the Company common
stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the Company stockholders will continue to own their shares of Company
common stock and will continue to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of
the Company common stock.
Under certain circumstances, the Company will be required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to $200 million and, under certain other
circumstances, Parent will be required to pay the Company a termination fee equal to $435 million. For more information, please see the section
of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”.
 
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
 
A:
The SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements
and annual reports with respect to two or more of the Company stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement
addressed to those Company stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding”, potentially means extra
convenience for Company stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Banks, brokers or other nominees with account holders who are Company stockholders may be “householding” proxy materials. A single
proxy statement will be delivered to multiple Company

stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected Company stockholders. If you have
received notice from your bank, broker or other nominee that they will be “householding” communications to your address, such
“householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to
participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your bank, broker or other nominee and
write or call us at the following address or phone number: Coupa Software Incorporated, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 1855 S. Grant Street,
San Mateo, CA 94402, or (650) 931-3200. Company stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address
and would like to request “householding” of their communications should contact their banks, brokers or other nominees. We will promptly
deliver an additional copy of the proxy statement to any stockholder who so requests.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or other written
statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by
such sections and other applicable law. Those statements are based on management’s beliefs, plans, expectations, projections and assumptions
about future events and trends, and on information currently available to management. Generally, the words “will”, “may”, “should”, “could”,
“would”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “continue”, “believe”, “seek”, “project”, “estimate”, and similar expressions used in this proxy
statement that do not relate to historical facts are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without
limitation, statements regarding the proposed merger and related matters; the expected timetable for completing the proposed merger; prospective
performance and opportunities, including projected financial information; general business outlook; filings and approvals relating to the
transactions; the ability to complete the transactions considering the various closing conditions; and any assumptions underlying any of the
foregoing.
Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date as of this proxy statement. They are and will be, as the case may be, subject to many
risks, uncertainties and factors relating to the operations and business environments of the Company that may cause the actual results of the
Company or its subsidiaries to be materially different from any future results, express or implied, in such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the impact of actions
and behaviors of customers, vendors and competitors; technological developments, as well as legal and regulatory rules and processes affecting the
Company’s business; the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals of the proposed merger
that could delay the consummation of the proposed merger or cause the parties to abandon the proposed merger; the occurrence of any event,
change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement entered into in connection with the proposed merger;
the possibility that the Company’s stockholders may not approve the merger agreement proposal; the risk that the parties to the merger agreement
may not be able to satisfy the conditions to the proposed merger in a timely manner or at all; risks related to disruption of management time from
ongoing business operations due to the proposed merger; the risk that any announcements relating to the proposed merger could have adverse
effects on the market price of Company common stock; the risk of any unexpected costs or expenses resulting from the proposed merger; the risk of
any litigation relating to the proposed merger; the risk that the proposed merger and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of
the Company to retain and hire key personnel and to maintain relationships with customers, vendors, partners, employees, stockholders and other
business relationships and on its operating results and business generally; and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports the
Company has filed or will file with the SEC, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 (the
“Annual Report”) and the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended April 30, 2022, July 31, 2022 and October 31, 2022 (the
“Quarterly Reports”) filed by the Company with the SEC, and, in particular, the risk factors set forth under the headings “Risk Factors” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report and the Quarterly Reports. The
Company’s filings with the SEC are available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.
Other factors and assumptions not identified above may also affect the forward-looking statements, and these other factors and assumptions may
also cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. The Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.
New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for the Company’s management to predict all risks, nor can it assess the impact of all factors on

the Company’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statements the Company may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking
events and circumstances discussed in this proxy statement may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those
anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.
The Company assumes no obligation to update such statements contained in this proxy statement to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions

The holders of a majority of all of the Company common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person

Coupa Software Inc_20230123_DEFM14A_20571922_4573621.Pdf,Vote Required,"Vote Required
Approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal
The approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of outstanding
shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on the matter. Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a
condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the
advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa.
Abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Company stockholder’s behalf) and broker non-votes will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger agreement proposal.
Approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on such
proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a
proxy to vote on a Company stockholder’s behalf) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory compensation proposal.
The vote on the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger agreement proposal. Because the
vote on the advisory compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on the Company, the Board, Parent or the surviving corporation.
Accordingly, because the Company is contractually obligated to pay the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including consummation of the merger, if the merger is approved
by our stockholders, such compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on
the advisory compensation proposal.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at
the special meeting. Abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Company stockholder’s behalf) and broker
non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal, regardless of whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. The
Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger agreement proposal is approved at the special meeting.
The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger agreement proposal. Accordingly, you may
vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the adjournment proposal and vice versa.
Neither approval of the advisory compensation proposal nor approval of the adjournment proposal is a condition to the consummation of the merger.

Notice and Proxy Statement
Coupa Software IncorporatedTable of Contents
A broker “non-vote” occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal
because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial
owner, but does have discretionary voting power over other “routine” items and submits votes for those matters. The Company does not expect any
broker non-votes at the special meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide banks, brokers and other
nominees with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine”, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the
special meeting is considered “non-routine”. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be permitted to vote your shares of Company
common stock at the special meeting without receiving instructions.",39,40

Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting and regardless of the number of shares of Company common stock you own, your
careful consideration of, and vote on, the merger agreement is important and we encourage you to vote promptly.
If you are a record holder of Company common stock (in other words, you held Company common stock in your own name in the stock register
maintained by our transfer agent, Computershare) and to ensure that your shares of Company common stock are voted at the special meeting, we
recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the virtual special meeting. In order to vote by proxy
card, please complete, sign, date and mail the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided or grant your proxy electronically over the
internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it
before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on February 22, 2023, one day before the special meeting. You may also vote by attending the virtual special meeting
and voting during the live webcast.
If you hold your shares in “street name” (in other words, your Company common stock is held in the name of your bank, broker or other nominee),
you should have received a proxy card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than from the Company. In
order to vote, complete, date, sign and mail the enclosed voting instruction form from your broker, bank or other nominee to ensure that your vote is
counted. Alternatively, you may vote by telephone or over the internet as instructed by your broker. To vote at the virtual special meeting, which will
have the same effect as revoking any previously submitted voting instructions, you will need to obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other
nominee and register in advance. Please see “—Registering for the Special Meeting” above for information on how to register in advance. Without
following the voting and/or registration instructions, your Company common stock held in “street name” will not be voted, which will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger agreement proposal and will not have any effect on the advisory compensation proposal and
adjournment proposal.

For Company stockholders of record, any time after you have submitted a proxy and before the proxy is exercised, you may revoke or change your

•
you may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy or voting instructions) in
accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting—Voting Procedures”; or
 
•
you may submit a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 
•
you may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company’s Corporate Secretary at Coupa Software Incorporated, 1855 S. Grant
Street, San Mateo, CA 94402; or
 
•
you may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself,
constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.
Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure
that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name”, you will need to revoke or resubmit your proxy through your broker, bank or other nominee and in
accordance with its procedures. If your broker, bank or other nominee allows you to submit a proxy via the internet or by telephone, you may be able
to change your vote by submitting a new proxy via the internet or by telephone (or by mail). In order to attend the virtual special meeting and vote
during the webcast, which will have the same effect as revoking any previously submitted voting instructions, you will need to obtain a legal proxy
issued in your name from your broker, bank or other nominee, who is the Company stockholder of record, and register in advance to attend the

Voting by Company Directors and Executive Officers
On December 11, 2022, in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, the Company’s directors, solely in their capacity as stockholders of
the Company (in such capacity, the “covered stockholders”), entered into the voting agreement with Parent and the Company. Under the voting
agreement, the covered stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of Company common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement
and certain other matters. As of January 19, 2023, the covered stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,430,474 shares of Company
common stock, or approximately 1.9% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock as of January 19, 2023. For more information regarding
common stock, or approximately 1.9% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock as of January 19, 2023. For more information regarding
the voting agreement, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Voting Agreement”.
In addition, as of January 19, 2023, the non-director executive officers of the Company, who are not party to the voting agreement, beneficially owned
an aggregate of 144,327 shares of Company common stock, or approximately 0.2% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock as of
January 19, 2023. We currently expect that all directors and executive officers of the Company, including non-director executive officers who are not
party to the voting agreement, will vote their shares of Company common stock “FOR” each of the proposals to be presented at the special meeting.
For more information regarding the security ownership of directors and executive officers of the Company, see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management”.
The Company’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the
Company stockholders generally. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Interests of the Company’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the merger consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Company
common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair
value of their shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your
shares of Company common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the merger consideration that you
are otherwise entitled to receive under the merger agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice
of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Company common stock
following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their
shares of Company common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is
required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal
rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to
consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.
A holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock who (1) continuously holds such shares through the effective time, (2)
has not voted in favor of or otherwise consented to the merger in writing or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (3) strictly complies
with the procedures under Section 262,

(4) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (5) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (a)
reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (b) provides documentary evidence of
such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be
and (c) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery
List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her
or its shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

Company stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including consummation of the merger. As required by
those rules, the Company is asking Company stockholders to vote on the approval of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the
consummation of the merger, as disclosed in the table entitled “Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers”, including the associated narrative

As part of their ongoing review of the Company’s business, the Board and the Company’s management periodically review and evaluate the
Company’s business and long-term strategy, competitive position, historical performance, future prospects and opportunities to increase
stockholder value. These reviews have included discussions as to whether the Company should continue to execute on its strategy as a standalone
company, pursue various buy-side acquisitions or pursue a sale of the Company. As part of these reviews, the Board and Company management
have considered from time to time potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value along with the potential benefits and risks of such
alternatives, and have periodically discussed such potential alternatives with Qatalyst Partners, the Company’s historic financial advisor. In addition,
at least since going public in 2016, the Company has routinely received requests for and had meetings with both strategic parties and financial
sponsors to discuss developments in the software industry and/or to express an interest in working with the Company in some fashion.
In connection with such discussions, on May 16, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners introduced Rob Bernshteyn, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company, to a representative of Thoma Bravo who they believed would be a useful contact for the Company in light of
Thoma Bravo’s activity and experience in the software industry. On May 24, 2022, Mr. Bernshteyn had an introductory telephonic conference call
with a representative of Thoma Bravo, during which call they discussed general trends in the industry. At no point during the call did the
representative of Thoma Bravo make a proposal to acquire the Company or state that Thoma Bravo wanted to pursue such an acquisition.
During the summer of 2022, representatives of each of Thoma Bravo and two other private equity firms, which we refer to as “Financial Sponsor A”
and “Financial Sponsor B”, contacted Mr. Bernshteyn to propose meetings to discuss developments in the software industry, and Mr. Bernshteyn
met with representatives of Financial Sponsor B in response to this outreach. At no point during this meeting did the representatives of Financial
Sponsor B make a proposal to acquire the Company or state that Financial Sponsor B wanted to pursue such an acquisition. Mr. Bernshteyn did not
meet with representatives of Thoma Bravo or Financial Sponsor A in response to these requests until the interactions described below.
During their regular meetings to discuss developments at the Company, Mr. Bernshteyn and Roger Siboni, the Company’s lead independent director,
discussed these interactions and agreed that this type of outreach would not alter the Company’s focus on executing its standalone plan absent a
substantive proposal that could be considered by the Board.
On September 6, 2022, after market close, the Company announced results for its second fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022. On the Company’s
earnings call, Mr. Bernshteyn noted that the current economic environment was highly dynamic and that it was unknown how the macroeconomic
picture would play out. He stated that in the event that the economy were to experience a softer landing and the demand environment remained
relatively healthy, the Company would continue to thoughtfully invest for growth and balance such investments with profitability and, in the event
of a recession, the Company would moderate its investments appropriately and, in more extreme cases, exercise significantly increased spending
discipline.

On September 22, 2022, in response to the earlier outreach from Financial Sponsor A, Mr. Bernshteyn met with representatives of Financial Sponsor
A for dinner, during which representatives of Financial Sponsor A told Mr. Bernshteyn that they were interested in learning more about the
Company.
On September 27, 2022, in response to the earlier outreach from Thoma Bravo, Mr. Bernshteyn met with representatives of Thoma Bravo for dinner,
during which the representatives of Thoma Bravo indicated interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company and stated that Thoma Bravo
would be willing to pay a premium of approximately 25% to the current share price of the Company’s common stock (which had closed at $61.44 that
day). Mr. Bernshteyn stated that he would discuss this indication of interest with the Board, noting that he did not believe the proposed premium
would be well received by the Board given the Company’s standalone prospects. Mr. Bernshteyn told the representatives of Thoma Bravo that he
would put them in touch with Qatalyst Partners.
On September 28, 2022, Mr. Bernshteyn called Mr. Siboni to discuss the recent interactions with Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A. Also on
September 28, 2022, a representative of Qatalyst Partners called a representative of Thoma Bravo to discuss the assumptions underlying Thoma
Bravo’s proposal, and indicated that Thoma Bravo would need to improve the proposal for the Board to consider entering into discussions with
respect to a potential acquisition of the Company.
On September 30, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A reached out to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express an interest in acquiring
the Company in an all-cash transaction. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated that Financial Sponsor A would need to make a more
specific proposal if the Board were to consider a potential transaction.
The representatives of Financial Sponsor A reached out to the representatives of Qatalyst Partners again on October 2, 2022 and presented a verbal,
non-binding proposal for an all-cash acquisition of the Company at a price between $78.00 and $82.00 per share, which proposal they were making
based on publicly available information. The closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 30, 2022, the last trading day prior to the
receipt of such proposal, was $58.80 per share. Financial Sponsor A also requested certain non-public information about the Company, which they
indicated might help them to refine their view on the per share price that they would be willing to pay in an acquisition. Financial Sponsor A also
stated to the representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it would want to speak to its limited partners in order to ensure that it could put together the
equity financing for the transaction in light of conditions existing in the debt and equity financing markets. Later on October 2, 2022, representatives
of Qatalyst Partners had a call with Mr. Bernshteyn to inform him of Financial Sponsor A’s proposal and request for non-public information.
On October 3, 2022, Mr. Bernshteyn and Mr. Siboni met virtually to discuss the recent interactions with Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, and
determined to set up a meeting of the full Board to discuss the situation.
On October 5, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo called representatives of Qatalyst Partners and presented a verbal, non-binding proposal for an
all-cash acquisition of the Company at a price of $80.00 per share, which proposal was based on publicly available information. Thoma Bravo also
requested certain non-public information about the Company to better inform its perspective regarding valuation. Thoma Bravo stated that it also
wanted to speak to its limited partners in order to ensure that it could arrange the equity financing for the transaction.
On October 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance
to discuss the proposals received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board
financial information and metrics with respect to the two proposals and a preliminary illustrative financial analysis of the Company utilizing publicly
available information, including research analyst forecasts for the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners also reviewed with the Board
other parties who they believed might be interested in an acquisition of the Company and considerations for the Board regarding how they might
respond to the two proposals. The Board agreed to reconvene a few days later to continue discussing the proposals. The Board agreed that Qatalyst
Partners should inform Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A that the Board was

evaluating their offers. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted each of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A after the meeting to deliver
this message.
On October 10, 2022, Qatalyst Partners provided to the Company and the Board a disclosure statement identifying prior and current engagements
and relationships between Qatalyst Partners and Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and the other parties identified by
Qatalyst Partners and reviewed with the Board at the October 6, 2022 meeting as being potentially interested in an acquisition of the Company.
On October 11, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
representatives of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP, the Company’s outside counsel (which we refer to as “Freshfields”), in attendance to
further discuss the proposals received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board
financial information and metrics with respect to the proposals, the Company’s historical stock price performance and a preliminary financial analysis
of the Company utilizing, for illustrative purposes, research analyst forecasts for the Company. Representatives of Freshfields reviewed with the
Board its fiduciary duties and other legal matters generally and in the context of an evaluation of a potential sale transaction. Following the
discussion, the Board determined that it would be helpful to update the Company’s existing long-term management financial plan and forecast and
for Qatalyst Partners to perform a financial analysis utilizing that updated plan and forecast before deciding whether to engage in discussions with
Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A and whether to reach out to additional parties regarding a potential acquisition of the Company, and
requested that management prepare an updated plan and forecast. The Board discussed whether it should create a transaction committee, but
deferred any decision on whether it should create such a committee until there was more clarity on how the overall situation would develop.
On October 21, 2022, the Board held another meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Freshfields in attendance to further discuss the proposals received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A. Company management informed the
Board that it had prepared an updated preliminary management plan and forecast, which it had provided to Qatalyst Partners for use in its financial
analysis with respect to the Company. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board financial metrics and information with respect to
the proposals, the Company’s historical stock price performance and a preliminary illustrative financial analysis of the Company utilizing the updated
preliminary management plan and forecast. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted that the price of the Company’s common stock had
declined approximately 11% since the date of Financial Sponsor A’s proposal and declined approximately 19% since the date of Thoma Bravo’s
proposal, broadly in line with the average stock price movement of companies in the mid-growth subscription software cohort (while the Nasdaq
composite index had traded up 1% and down 4%, respectively, since such dates), and also that a price of $80.00 per share represented a premium of
53% to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on October 19, 2022. Representatives of the Company’s management team then reviewed
with the Board the key components of the updated preliminary management plan and provided their perspective on the Company’s recent
performance and outlook, including that overall the Company was going to face a challenging period over the next several years as overall business
and macroeconomic conditions were likely to be difficult and present significant challenges for the Company’s financial results, namely revenue
growth and margins. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted that research analyst forecasts for the Company were assuming better
performance than the updated preliminary management plan. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners also reviewed data showing that subscription
software revenue multiples had reached all-time highs in 2020 and 2021, but in 2022 had retreated meaningfully. The Board discussed the updated
preliminary management plan with Company management and requested that management hold another session with the Board to more fully review
the underlying assumptions, including an analysis of potential upsides to the plan.
After further discussion, the Board determined that, in light of the significant risks inherent in the Company’s standalone plan and prospects relative
to the price per share implied by the proposals made by Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, it made sense to provide limited additional non-
public information to the parties, as well as a management presentation and information session, to see if Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A
could provide offers that provided certain and compelling value to the Company’s stockholders relative to its standalone prospects. The Board also
discussed that, in light of the importance of certainty of funding, each of
 
 
40

Table of Contents
Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A should also be permitted to contact a discrete number of their existing limited partners so that they could
confirm their ability to arrange the necessary equity financing for a transaction and authorized Qatalyst Partners to respond to those requests. The
Board also discussed whether to contact any other parties to see if they might be interested in a potential transaction with the Company and
discussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Company management which financial and strategic parties would be most likely to be
interested in doing so. After discussion, the Board authorized Qatalyst Partners to contact Financial Sponsor B and two additional financial
sponsors (referred to as “Financial Sponsor C” and “Financial Sponsor D”) to see if they were interested in a potential transaction with the Company
and, if so, to ask them to provide a preliminary indication of interest based on public information as Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A had done.
The Board determined not to contact any potential strategic acquirors at this time given the risk of a potential leak, as the most likely strategic
acquirors operated in the same industry as the Company, but agreed to consider the matter further at a subsequent Board meeting. At the meeting,
the Board also reviewed the disclosure statement that had previously been provided by Qatalyst Partners and determined that the disclosure
statement did not present any material conflicts that would impair the ability of Qatalyst Partners to act as the Company’s financial advisor. The
Board then discussed the formal engagement of Qatalyst Partners as its financial advisor, noting Qatalyst Partners’ long-standing relationship with
the Company as well as Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and the
industry in which it operates. The Board then approved the terms of the proposed form of engagement letter providing for Qatalyst Partners’
engagement as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with a potential sale of the Company, which was executed by the Company and
Qatalyst Partners the following day.
On October 22, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A to inform them that the Company was
willing to provide them with limited non-public information and authorized them to contact limited partners as potential equity sources, and shared a
draft confidentiality agreement that had been prepared by Freshfields. On the same day, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Financial
Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C indicating that the Company had received acquisition proposals, and inquired if they would be interested in a
potential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners invited Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C to make
preliminary proposals based on public information and sent the draft confidentiality agreement to each of them. On October 24, 2022, representatives
of Qatalyst Partners reached out and sent the draft confidentiality agreement to Financial Sponsor D, indicating that the Company had received
acquisition proposals, and invited them to make a preliminary proposal based on public information. The Company and Freshfields negotiated the
terms of the confidentiality agreements with Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor B over the next several days and executed the
confidentiality agreement with Financial Sponsor A on October 26, 2022, and with each of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor B on October 28,
2022. All of these confidentiality agreements included customary standstill provisions that would terminate if, among other things, the Company
entered into an agreement providing for a change of control transaction with a third party. During the course of the negotiations of the
confidentiality agreements and discussions with Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, as authorized by the Board, Qatalyst Partners (in
consultation with Company management) separately agreed with each of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A which limited partners they would
be permitted to contact.
On October 27, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor C contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and stated that they might be interested
in a potential transaction, and that based on their review of public information they were providing a verbal, non-binding proposal for an all-cash
acquisition of the Company at a price of between $70.00 and $75.00 per share. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated that this would
likely not be sufficient to move forward. Following that discussion, the representatives of Financial Sponsor C contacted the representatives of
Qatalyst Partners again and indicated they could likely get to a price in the mid-$70s per share.
Also on October 27, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor B contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and expressed an interest in a
potential transaction and provided an oral indication of value of $70.00 per share. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated that this would
likely not be sufficient to move forward.

Also on October 27, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent certain non-public financial and operating information regarding the Company to
Financial Sponsor A, and on October 28, 2022, the representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent the same information to Thoma Bravo.
On October 28, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor D informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that Financial Sponsor D was not
interested in proceeding with a potential acquisition of the Company because they did not believe they would be able to reach an acceptable value in
a competitive sale process. Financial Sponsor D never signed a confidentiality agreement with the Company.
On October 30, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management to review the updated preliminary management plan
and forecast reflecting the feedback from the Board at the meeting on October 21, 2022. The Board provided input on the updated preliminary
management plan and forecast, noting areas where the preliminary management plan that had originally been presented by Company management on
October 21, 2022 could be updated to include an alternative near-term macroeconomic scenario that was more optimistic in various respects,
including with respect to cost reductions and margin improvement.
On October 31, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Freshfields in attendance. Representatives of Company management reported that information had been provided to each of Thoma Bravo and
Financial Sponsor A, and management presentations had been scheduled for later in the week. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided an
update on the oral indications that had been received from Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. After discussion, the Board determined not
to proceed with discussions with Financial Sponsor B or Financial Sponsor C at this stage or to provide them with non-public information regarding
the Company, as any leak or market rumor that indicated that the Company might be willing to consider a sale transaction at prices below those
reflected in the current proposals from Thoma Bravo or Financial Sponsor A would be detrimental in extracting the highest price possible from those
two bidders. The Board also considered contacting strategic parties and concluded, after discussion with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Company management, that three companies (which we refer to as “Strategic Party E”, “Strategic Party F” and “Strategic Party G”) were the strategic
parties most likely to be interested in a potential transaction. The Board considered other strategic parties and concluded that those parties were not
likely to be interested in a potential transaction, given the Board’s understanding of the likely areas of focus and strategic direction of those strategic
parties. The Board instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to contact each of Strategic Party E, Strategic Party F and Strategic Party G.
Following the Board meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C and
communicated that their respective offers were not sufficient to warrant providing non-public information.
Later that day, Mr. Bernshteyn reached out to the chief executive officer of Strategic Party E to request a telephonic meeting.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Strategic Party F and Strategic Party G on October 31, 2022 and November 1, 2022, respectively, to
ask if they would be interested in a potential acquisition of the Company. Later on November 1, 2022, representatives of each of Strategic Party F and
Strategic Party G told the representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they were not interested in pursuing such an acquisition.
Also on November 1, 2022, in the morning, representatives of the Company met representatives of Thoma Bravo in person to provide the Company’s
management presentation. Later on November 1, 2022, the representatives of the Company met representatives of Financial Sponsor A in person to
provide the Company’s management presentation.
Also on November 1, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor C sent a letter to the Board with a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the
Company at a price between $70.00 and $75.00 per share, to formally register

their interest. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners reiterated to representatives of Financial Sponsor C that their price was not sufficient to move
forward in the process.
Also on November 1, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor B contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to indicate that they may be willing
to increase their proposed price to between $80.00 and $82.00 per share if they were provided with non-public information about the Company, but
explained that this was a proposal Financial Sponsor B had limited confidence in given that they had not completed the diligence that would be
required to fully understand the business. Based on this increase in indicative value, on November 2, 2022, the representatives of Qatalyst Partners
provided to Financial Sponsor B the non-public financial and operating information regarding the Company that had been provided to Thoma Bravo
and Financial Sponsor A.
On November 3, 2022, the chief executive officer of Strategic Party E called Mr. Bernshteyn following Mr. Bernshteyn’s initial outreach on October 31,
2022. Mr. Bernshteyn told the chief executive officer of Strategic Party E that the Company had received inbound acquisition proposals and asked
him if Strategic Party E would be interested in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. The chief executive officer of Strategic Party E told
Mr. Bernshteyn that Strategic Party E was interested in exploring a potential acquisition and would like to review non-public information regarding
the Company. Over the next two weeks, the parties negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement. During the pendency of that two-week
period, the representatives of Qatalyst Partners engaged in a number of conversations with representatives of Strategic Party E to encourage them to
move more quickly as other parties were progressing with receiving non-public information and access to a management presentation.
On November 7, 2022, representatives of the Company met with representatives of Financial Sponsor B in person to provide the Company’s
management presentation.
On November 9, 2022, despite the message from Qatalyst Partners that its proposed price was not sufficient, Financial Sponsor C executed a
confidentiality agreement with the Company. The confidentiality agreement included a customary standstill provision that would terminate if, among
other things, the Company entered into an agreement providing for a change of control transaction with a third party.
On November 10, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they would be in a position to provide a
revised proposal by the following week. Also on November 10, representatives of Qatalyst Partners told representatives of Financial Sponsor A and
Financial Sponsor B, respectively, that they would need to provide revised proposals by November 17, 2022.
On November 16, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with Financial Sponsor A to understand how they were progressing, since
Financial Sponsor A had indicated they would be in a position to provide a revised indication by this date. Financial Sponsor A stated that it was
trying to remain in their initial range of $78.00 to 82.00 per share, and while it continued to work diligently, it would need access to full due diligence
and access to debt financing sources to be able to put forth a revised, fully informed and certain proposal.
Also on November 16, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with a representative of Financial Sponsor B, and the representative of
Financial Sponsor B stated that, despite its prior indication that Financial Sponsor B might be able to get to a valuation range of between $80.00 and
$82.00 per share, it was not likely to be able to do so and, based on the trends in the Company’s business, Financial Sponsor B reverted back to its
initial price of $70.00 per share. The representatives of Financial Sponsor B also stated that they would need a partner to effect a transaction.
On November 17, 2022, the Company and Strategic Party E executed a confidentiality agreement that included a customary standstill provision that
would terminate if, among other things, the Company entered into an agreement providing for a change of control transaction with a third party. Later
that day, representatives of the Company met virtually with representatives of Strategic Party E to provide the Company’s management

presentation. Given the Company’s uncertainty at this stage about Strategic Party E’s level of interest in an acquisition of the Company and the fact
that Strategic Party E was a potential competitor of the Company, Strategic Party E was not provided with the non-public financial and operating
information regarding the Company that had been provided to Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor B.
Also on November 17, 2022, in the evening, representatives of Thoma Bravo sent a letter to representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a non-binding
proposal for an acquisition of the Company at a price of $75.00 per share. The letter noted that $75.00 per share represented a 55% premium to the
Company common stock’s closing share price of $48.34 on that day and requested 30 days of exclusivity. On the same day, representatives of
Financial Sponsor A reached out to the representatives of Qatalyst Partners and reaffirmed that they were continuing to work with their partners to
remain within their initial indicative range of $78.00 to $82.00 per share.
On November 18, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Freshfields in attendance to receive an update on the interactions that had occurred to date with various parties regarding a potential sale
transaction involving the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners stated that each of Strategic Party E, Strategic Party F and Strategic
Party G had been contacted, and that Strategic Party F and Strategic Party G had both declined to pursue a potential transaction. The representatives
of Qatalyst Partners said that Strategic Party E had expressed interest in pursuing a potential transaction, but that they were moving very slowly
despite strong encouragement from Qatalyst Partners to move more deliberately if they were genuinely interested. The representatives of Qatalyst
Partners reviewed the revised and reaffirmed proposals received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, respectively, and reported that both
Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A had stressed the importance of being able to conduct full due diligence and to talk to both equity and debt
financing sources in order to be able to put forward firm proposals that were certain and actionable. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners then
provided updates on other interactions with financial sponsor parties, noting that Financial Sponsor D had declined to participate in the process.
The representatives of Qatalyst Partners also reported on the conversation with Financial Sponsor B, noting that they had not remained within their
revised indicative range of $80.00 to $82.00 per share, were now back to their initial indication at $70.00 per share and needed to add an equity partner
in order to put forth a firm offer, citing the Company’s recent deceleration in growth and declining bookings.
Also at the meeting, representatives of the Company’s management team reviewed with the Board an updated preliminary management plan that
reflected two scenarios, the first of which was consistent with the plan discussed with the Board at its meeting on October 21, 2022, and the second
of which reflected the potential upsides discussed by management and the Board at that meeting and again at the meeting of the Board on October
30, 2022. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed the Company’s preliminary financial information and Qatalyst Partners’ analysis with
respect to the Company utilizing the updated preliminary management plan. After discussion, the Board asked management to prepare a further
revised plan and forecast reflecting the conservative revenue growth assumptions in one of the two scenarios in light of the macroeconomic outlook,
but reflecting additional cost reductions by the Company in order to strengthen and improve margins, expressing the Board’s view that such a
forecast would reflect the Board’s best estimates for the future outlook for the Company. After further discussion, the Board determined that, in light
of the Company’s standalone prospects and outlook, it would be beneficial to continue discussions with the parties that had expressed meaningful
interest in a potential acquisition of the Company and to allow them to complete their due diligence, receive and mark-up a merger agreement and
arrange financing so that the Company and the Board would then be in a position to have the firmest bids possible to evaluate if they provided
superior value for stockholders relative to the Company’s risk-adjusted standalone value. The Board determined to provide full due diligence access
to Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, and also authorized representatives of Qatalyst Partners to provide diligence access at a future date to
any other bidders who submitted proposals with an appropriate value range and had demonstrated conviction regarding a potential transaction,
including as a potential equity partner to Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A or another bidder. The Board also discussed that, were the Company
ultimately to agree to a transaction, it would be optimal to announce the transaction on or prior to December 12, 2022, the scheduled date of the
Company’s quarterly earnings call, because if the

Company common stock continued to trade negatively after the earnings announcement, there was significant risk that interested parties would
reduce their offers based on any adverse market reaction to the earnings announcement.
Also at the Board meeting on November 18, 2022, the Board determined that it would be beneficial to create a committee so that a smaller group of
directors would be available to Company management and the financial and legal advisors, including at times when it was not practicable to convene
the full Board. The Board then created a committee of the Board, which we refer to as the “transaction committee”, for that purpose, comprised of
independent director Ms. Brennan, lead independent director Mr. Siboni and independent director Tayloe Stansbury. The transaction committee was
not created to address any actual or perceived conflict of interest.
Later on November 18, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor B presented representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a verbal non-binding
proposal for an acquisition of the Company at a price of $70.00 per share. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners informed representatives of
Financial Sponsor B that they would not be moving forward.
On November 21, 2022, the Company made available to Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A due diligence materials through a virtual data room,
and between November 21, 2022 and December 11, 2022, representatives of Company management and Qatalyst Partners had numerous calls and
meetings with representatives of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A regarding due diligence. Also on November 21, 2022, representatives of
another financial sponsor, which we refer to as “Financial Sponsor H” reached out to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express an interest in a
potential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners told the representatives of Financial Sponsor H to provide a
preliminary indication of value based on public information.
On November 22, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Freshfields
in attendance to review the key terms of the draft merger agreement that was being prepared by Freshfields before submitting the draft to potential
bidders. After discussion, the transaction committee determined that the initial draft merger agreement should include, among other terms, (1) a go-
shop period of 50 days, (2) a termination fee payable by the Company equal to 1.0% of the Company’s fully diluted equity value based on the merger
consideration if the merger agreement was terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a superior proposal received prior to the end of
the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by the Company equal to 2.0% of the Company’s fully diluted equity value based on the merger
consideration if the merger agreement was terminated under certain other circumstances and (4) a termination fee payable by the potential acquiror
equal to 8.0% of the Company’s fully diluted equity value based on the merger consideration if the merger agreement was terminated under certain
other circumstances. The transaction committee instructed the representatives of Freshfields to update the draft merger agreement based on the
discussions in the meeting.
On November 22, 2022, the compensation committee of the Board held a meeting by videoconference with representatives of Freshfields in
attendance to review the treatment of equity awards in the draft merger agreement, as well as some of the key compensation and benefits-related
terms of the draft merger agreement. The compensation committee noted that the draft merger agreement contemplated that Mr. Bernshteyn’s July
2022 Company PSUs would be treated in accordance with the terms of the underlying award agreement, which would likely result in those Company
PSUs being cancelled for no consideration.
Also on November 22, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor, which we refer to as “Financial Sponsor I”, reached out to representatives of
Qatalyst Partners to express an interest in a potential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners told the representatives
of Financial Sponsor I to provide a preliminary indication of value based on public information.
On November 23, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor I sent a letter to Qatalyst Partners detailing a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of
the Company at a price of $75.00 per share. While Financial Sponsor I

initially indicated that it would expect to lead an acquisition, it later informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they would instead be better
positioned as an equity partner to another financial sponsor.
Also on November 23, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor H sent a letter to the Board with a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the
Company at a price per share of between $65.00 and $68.00 and stating that they would expect to co-lead the acquisition with one or more equity
partners.
Also on November 23, 2022, representatives of Freshfields sent a draft merger agreement reflecting the terms approved by the transaction committee
to representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Thoma Bravo’s legal counsel (which we refer to as “Kirkland”), and to representatives of Financial
Sponsor A’s legal counsel.
In the afternoon of November 23, 2022, Bloomberg published an article stating that a certain financial sponsor was exploring an acquisition of the
Company but that no deal was imminent. Following the Bloomberg report, the Company’s stock price closed at $58.93 on November 23, 2022,
compared to $45.72 on November 22, 2022 (the trading day ended immediately prior to the Bloomberg report).
On November 25, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke to representatives of Financial Sponsor C to inform them that they would be
provided with access to non-public information regarding the Company. During the call, the representatives of Financial Sponsor C informed the
representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they were still in the range of $70.00 to $75.00 per share proposed in the letter they had sent to the Board on
November 1, 2022. Later that day, the Company made available to Financial Sponsor C due diligence materials through the virtual data room.
On November 25, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent a draft confidentiality agreement to Financial Sponsor I, and the Company and Financial
Sponsor I executed the agreement on November 26, 2022. The confidentiality agreement included a customary standstill provision that would
terminate if, among other things, the Company entered into an agreement providing for a change of control transaction with a third party.
On November 26, 2022, the Company made available to Financial Sponsor I due diligence materials through the virtual data room.
Following the Bloomberg article on November 23, 2022, several stockholders of the Company sent communications to the Company and/or the Board
representing a range of views, with some encouraging the Company to pursue a sale and others voicing concerns regarding the pursuit of a sale
given the current market conditions. Among the stockholders voicing concerns, some indicated that they would oppose a transaction for a sale of
the Company unless it were at a price above the price ultimately agreed to by Thoma Bravo, while others indicated that a price below that level would
be acceptable. Stockholders encouraging the Company to pursue a transaction indicated that they believed a well-run process would likely result in
an acceptable value. All of these communications were shared with the Board.
On November 26, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor, which we refer to as “Financial Sponsor J”, reached out to representatives of Qatalyst
Partners to express an interest in a potential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners told the representatives of
Financial Sponsor J to provide a preliminary indication of value based on public information.
On November 27, 2022, the draft merger agreement was posted to the virtual data room so that other parties (as well as Thoma Bravo and Financial
Sponsor A) would have access to it once they received data room access.
On November 28, 2022, representatives of Strategic Party E called representatives of Qatalyst Partners to communicate that they did not wish to
continue discussions regarding a potential acquisition of the Company based on Strategic Party E’s view of the Company’s expected growth and
margins, operational challenges and integration complexity. Also on November 28, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor, which we refer to as

“Financial Sponsor K”, reached out to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express an interest in a potential acquisition of the Company. The
representatives of Qatalyst Partners told the representatives of Financial Sponsor K to provide a preliminary indication of value based on public
information.
On November 29, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled in-person meeting with management in attendance. At the meeting, Company
management discussed with the Board the updated management plan that the Board had requested management to prepare, including the Financial
Forecasts (as described under “—Certain Financial Forecasts”) and key assumptions underlying the updated management plan. After discussion,
the Board approved the Financial Forecasts for use in the Board’s evaluation of a potential acquisition of the Company, and instructed Company
management to provide the Financial Forecasts to Qatalyst Partners and to parties that had been provided access to the virtual data room in
connection with discussions regarding a potential acquisition of the Company.
Also on November 29, 2022, a representative of a large stockholder of the Company emailed members of Company management requesting a meeting
with Mr. Siboni, the Company’s lead independent director, in order to share its views on the public market discourse regarding the Company
following the Bloomberg report.
Also on November 29, 2022, representatives of another financial sponsor, which we refer to as “Financial Sponsor L”, called representatives of
Qatalyst Partners to say that they would be interested in a potential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners told the
representatives of Financial Sponsor L to provide a preliminary indication of value based on public information.
On November 30, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor, which we refer to as “Financial Sponsor M”, called representatives of Qatalyst
Partners to say that they would be interested in a potential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners told the
representatives of Financial Sponsor M to provide a preliminary indication of value based on public information.
Later on November 30, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Freshfields in
attendance to discuss the interactions that had occurred to date with various parties regarding a potential sale transaction involving the Company.
After the Board meeting, also on November 30, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting by videoconference with all members of the Board
(other than Mr. Bernshteyn who had another commitment) and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Freshfields in attendance and further
discussed the interactions that had occurred to date with various parties regarding the potential sale transaction involving the Company. In both
meetings, it was discussed that Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A had completed the most work to date. It was also discussed that Strategic
Party E had withdrawn from the process. It was also discussed that Financial Sponsor I had made a proposal at $75.00 per share, but that they had
informed Qatalyst Partners that they were more interested in acting as a financing source to another financial sponsor and so Qatalyst Partners had
provided them with access to the virtual data room. It was also discussed that Financial Sponsor H had provided an indication of interest at a price
of between $65.00 and $68.00 per share, but given that their indication was so much lower than other involved parties, Financial Sponsor H would
not be given access to the virtual data room. The Board members were also informed of the outreach from Financial Sponsor K, Financial Sponsor L
and Financial Sponsor M and that the representatives of Qatalyst Partners had told them to put forward a written non-binding proposal based on
public information for consideration by the Board if they were interested in doing so. During the transaction committee meeting, the transaction
committee discussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Freshfields a potential timeline for seeking fully diligenced and fully financed
proposals for a potential transaction. The transaction committee instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to reach out to Thoma Bravo and
Financial Sponsor A (the two parties that were the most advanced in their efforts) to ask whether either party believed they would be able to finalize
their due diligence and arrange financing by December 12th, which was the scheduled date of the Company’s quarterly earnings call.

Also on November 30, 2022, after the Board meeting, representatives of Financial Sponsor M presented representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a
verbal non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the Company at a price per share of between $70.00 and $75.00, subject to confirmation based on
additional diligence.
On December 1, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor K sent a letter to the Board with a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the
Company at a price between $68.00 and $71.00 per share. Also on December 1, representatives of Financial Sponsor L called representatives of
Qatalyst Partners to say that they would be interested in playing a role in a potential acquisition of the Company as an equity partner to another
bidder and at a price of between $70.00 and $80.00 per share. On the same day, representatives of Financial Sponsor J called representatives of
Qatalyst Partners to state that their interest was in potentially making an equity investment in the Company as opposed to an acquisition.
Later on December 1, 2022, representatives of the Company met virtually with representatives of Financial Sponsor I to provide the Company’s
management presentation.
On December 2, representatives of Financial Sponsor A’s legal counsel sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Freshfields.
This draft of the merger agreement (1) eliminated the go-shop provision, (2) proposed a Company termination fee of 3.75% of the fully diluted equity
value of the Company based on the merger consideration, (3) provided that the Company was to reimburse Financial Sponsor A’s transaction
expenses up to $40 million if the deal was terminated due to the Company’s failure to obtain stockholder approval and (4) proposed an acquiror
termination fee of 4.25% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger consideration.
Also on December 2, Mr. Siboni and a representative of Company management met with representatives of the large stockholder that had reached
out to the Company on November 29, 2022. The stockholder expressed its views regarding a potential transaction and regarding the Company’s
standalone prospects, and suggested that they may be supportive of a sale of the Company at a price at or below the price ultimately agreed to by
Thoma Bravo. Mr. Siboni and the representative of the Company were in “listen only” mode during the entirety of the meeting given that the
Company was in a quiet period leading up to quarterly earnings and because the Company had not made any public comment on the market
speculation regarding a potential sale.
On December 4, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst
Partners and Freshfields in attendance to receive an update on the status of discussions with the various potentially interested parties. The
representatives of Qatalyst Partners reported that Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A continued to be the two parties that were working the
hardest to complete due diligence and finalize their financing as promptly as practicable, including trying to see if a transaction could be finalized
prior to December 12th (when the Company would be reporting its quarterly earnings). The representatives of Qatalyst Partners stated that Financial
Sponsor A indicated that it was possible they would need to partner with another financial sponsor as a financing source in order to obtain
committed financing. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted that, in thinking about who to partner with Financial Sponsor A (were they to
need a partner), an important consideration was whether a partner would impair getting the highest price by not being willing to support a bid at a
value that the lead partner in the potential consortium was willing to pay. In that regard, they noted that Financial Sponsor I, who had expressed an
interest in participating in a transaction but had stated that they would not be able to effect a transaction on their own and would prefer to be a
partner to another bidder, had given an indication of interest at a price of $75.00 per share of Company common stock and seemed to be fully
engaged in due diligence. Other potential partners, on the other hand, either seemed less engaged and informed than Financial Sponsor I or had
expressed an interest in a transaction at lower values. Following discussion, the transaction committee authorized the representatives of Qatalyst
Partners to pair Financial Sponsor A with Financial Sponsor I were Financial Sponsor A to need another financial sponsor as a financing source.
Also at the meeting, the representatives of Freshfields reviewed the key issues raised in the markup of the merger agreement that had been received
from counsel to Financial Sponsor A and received feedback from the members of the transaction committee on those items. The transaction
committee also

management presentation.
Also on December 4, 2022, representatives of Freshfields sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Financial Sponsor A’s
legal counsel. This draft of the merger agreement (1) accepted the elimination of the “go-shop” provision and proposed a Company termination fee
of 2.5% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger consideration, (2) eliminated the provision requiring the Company to
reimburse Financial Sponsor A’s transaction expenses up to $40 million if the deal was terminated due to the Company’s failure to obtain stockholder
approval and (3) proposed an acquiror termination fee of 7.0% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger consideration.
Later on December 4, 2022, representatives of Kirkland sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Freshfields on behalf of
Thoma Bravo. This draft of the merger agreement (1) eliminated the go-shop provision, (2) proposed a Company termination fee of 3.5% of the fully
diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger consideration, (3) provided that the Company was to reimburse Financial Sponsor A’s
transaction expenses up to $10 million if the deal was terminated due to the Company’s failure to obtain stockholder approval and (4) proposed an
acquiror termination fee of 5.0% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger consideration.
On December 5, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A’s legal counsel sent initial drafts of an equity commitment letter and limited guarantee
to representatives of Freshfields. Over the next several days, until December 11, 2022, the representatives of Freshfields and the representatives of
Financial Sponsor A’s legal counsel negotiated the terms of the equity commitment letter and limited guarantee.
Also on December 5, 2022, representatives of Kirkland sent an initial draft of an equity commitment letter to representatives of Freshfields, and, on

another financial sponsor as a financing source, and, based on the prior authorization from the transaction committee, the representatives of Qatalyst
Partners authorized Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor I to work together.
On December 6, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor C called representatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform them that, based on the diligence
that Financial Sponsor C had performed and its views of the trends in business, Financial Sponsor C’s proposed price for an acquisition of the
Company was now in the low $70s per share.
Also on December 6, 2022, representatives of Freshfields sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Kirkland. This draft of the
merger agreement (1) proposed a Company termination fee of 2.5% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger
consideration, (2) eliminated the provision requiring the Company to reimburse Financial Sponsor A’s transaction expenses up to $10 million if the
deal was terminated due to the Company’s failure to obtain stockholder approval and (3) proposed an acquiror termination fee of 7.0% of the fully

Also on December 7, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A’s legal counsel sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of

based on the merger consideration, (2) added back the provision that the Company was to reimburse Financial Sponsor A’s transaction expenses up
to $40 million if the deal was terminated due to the Company’s failure to obtain stockholder approval and (3) proposed an acquiror termination fee of

On December 9, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo sent a letter to representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a non-binding proposal for an
acquisition of the Company at a price of $73.00 per share (representing a premium of 59.7% to the $45.72 closing price of the Company’s common
stock on November 22, 2022, the trading day ended immediately prior to the publication of Bloomberg’s report that a financial sponsor was exploring
a potential acquisition of the Company) and a request for exclusivity until market open on December 12, 2022. The representatives of Thoma Bravo
also sent a revised draft of the merger agreement that (1) proposed a Company termination fee of 3.0% of the fully diluted equity value of the
Company based on the merger consideration, (2) provided that the Company was to reimburse Thoma Bravo’s transaction expenses up to $7.5
million if the deal was terminated due to the Company’s failure to obtain stockholder approval and (3) proposed an acquiror termination fee of 6.0%
of the fully diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger consideration. Over the next several days, until December 11, 2022, the
representatives of Freshfields and the representatives of Kirkland continued to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement.
Also on December 9, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A sent a letter to representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a non-binding proposal
for an acquisition of the Company at a price of $76.00 per share (representing a premium of 66.2% to the closing price of the Company’s common
stock on November 22, 2022) and a request for exclusivity until 9:00 am, Eastern time, on December 12, 2022.
Later on December 9, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Freshfields in attendance to receive a summary of the bids that had been received from each of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A regarding a
potential all-cash acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed the two proposals and provided the Board with an

challenges evident in the Company’s forecast and the difficult environment facing the software industry as well as the risks inherent in the
Company’s plan when delivering their bids. The representatives of Freshfields reviewed with the Board the key differences between the terms in the
transaction documentation that had been negotiated with each of Thoma Bravo’s and Financial Sponsor A’s counsel to date. After further
discussion, the Board instructed the representatives of Qatalyst

Table of Contents
Partners to let Thoma Bravo know that they were not the highest bidder and, as a result, if they were not able to improve their bid the Company
would not transact with them and would go in a different direction. The Board also instructed the representatives of Qatalyst Partners to let Financial
Sponsor A know that there were a number of places in their draft transaction documents where the Board wanted to see improvement. The
representatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed these messages to representatives of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, respectively, shortly
after the meeting. The representatives of Thoma Bravo told the representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they would be able to increase their price
and would revert the following day with a revised proposal.
On December 10, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo presented representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a verbal, non-binding proposal for an
acquisition of the Company at a price of $77.00 per share.
Also on December 10, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Freshfields in attendance to receive an update on the discussions with Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A regarding the potential sale
transaction involving the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners reported that Thoma Bravo submitted a revised bid of $77.00 per share.
The representatives of Qatalyst Partners also reported that they had then contacted Financial Sponsor A to let them know that they were not the
highest bidder, and that Financial Sponsor A had stated that they would be willing to improve from their last price of $76.00 per share. After
discussion, the Board determined that it needed to obtain improved proposals at higher prices from each bidder, and that the best way to achieve
this objective was to set a final bid deadline for the following day at which time both bidders would need to have all of their transaction
documentation finalized and then submit “best and final bids” so that the Board could have the firmest bids possible so it could then evaluate
whether the bids provided superior value for stockholders relative to the Company’s risk-adjusted standalone value. Shortly after the meeting, the
representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to each of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A to ask them to submit their best and final bids no
later than 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on the following day.
Later that day, representatives of Kirkland and representatives of Financial Sponsor A’s legal counsel each sent revised drafts of the merger
agreement that provided for (1) a Company termination fee of 3.0% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger
consideration, (2) no reimbursement of the acquiror’s expenses by the Company if the deal was terminated due to the Company’s failure to obtain
stockholder approval and (3) an acquiror termination fee of 6.5% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger consideration.
Shortly before 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on December 11, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A sent a letter to representatives of Qatalyst
Partners with a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the Company at a price of $79.05 per share and representatives of Thoma Bravo sent a
letter to representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the Company at a price of $81.00 per share
(representing a premium of 77.2% to the $45.72 closing price of the Company’s common stock on November 22, 2022).
Later that day on December 11, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst
Partners and Freshfields in attendance. The Board discussed the proposals that had been received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A with
Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Freshfields and concluded that the Thoma Bravo proposal was more favorable
to the Company on financial and legal terms. A representative of Freshfields delivered a legal presentation outlining the terms of the final draft of the
merger agreement and the final drafts of the debt and equity financing documentation that representatives of Thoma Bravo had delivered, and
reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties. Following the legal presentation, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board its
financial analyses of the merger consideration proposed by Thoma Bravo and, at the request of the Board, rendered to the Board its oral opinion,
which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 11, 2022, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B,
to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters
set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of
shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of

Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as set forth in such opinion as more fully described in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”. The Board also reviewed an updated disclosure statement from Qatalyst
Partners identifying prior or current engagements or relationships between Qatalyst Partners and affiliates of Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A,
Financial Sponsor C, Financial Sponsor I and certain equity financing sources of the foregoing. The Board then recessed and the compensation
committee conducted a meeting with the full Board in attendance, and reviewed and approved the treatment of the Company’s outstanding equity
awards in the merger agreement as well as certain other compensation and benefits-related matters in the merger agreement. Following the meeting of
the compensation committee, the Board reconvened.
After discussion and consideration of a variety of factors, including those discussed under “—Reasons for the Merger”, the Board resolved to
proceed with the proposal from Thoma Bravo and unanimously (1) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
merger, (2) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders for the Company to enter into the merger agreement and
declared the merger agreement advisable, (3) directed that the Company submit the adoption of the merger agreement to a vote of the holders of
Company common stock in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and (4) resolved to recommend that the holders of Company common
stock adopt the merger agreement.
Following the meeting of the Board, the parties executed the merger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the voting agreement,
the debt and equity commitment letters and the limited guarantee.
The following morning, on December 12, 2022, the Company issued a press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement and the

holders of Company common stock adopt the merger agreement, the Board consulted with and received the advice of its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, discussed certain issues with the Company’s management and considered a variety of factors weighing positively in favor of
the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the following non-exhaustive list of material factors (not
necessarily in order of relative importance):
 
•
The merger consideration represents a significant premium across a number of measuring periods. The merger consideration of $81.00
per share was an attractive value for the shares of the Company’s common stock and represented:
 
•
a 77% premium over the $45.72 closing price of the Company common stock on November 22, 2022 (the last full trading day
prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company);
 
•
a 72% premium over the volume weighted average price of the Company common stock of $47.12 reported for the five-trading
day period ended November 22, 2022;
 
•
a 64% premium over the volume weighted average price of the Company common stock of $49.41 reported for the 30-trading
day period ended November 22, 2022; and
 
•
a 37% premium over the volume weighted average price of the Company common stock of $59.02 reported for the 90-trading
day period ended November 22, 2022;
 
•
Risks relating to remaining a stand-alone company. The Board evaluated the Company’s long-term strategic plan were it to remain an
independent public company, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such plan. This evaluation included the Board’s
review of the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings, prospects, competitive position and the nature of the
industry in which the Company competes, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified) of those factors on the trading
price of the Company’s common stock. The Board ultimately determined that the certainty of value provided by the acquisition of the
Company by Parent for $81.00 per share in cash was more favorable to Company stockholders than the risk-adjusted value of remaining
an independent public company, after accounting for the risks and uncertainties that the Company would face if it continued to operate
on a standalone public company basis. Such risks include:
 
•
risks relating to the industry in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, the competitive market for BSM
software;
 
•
risks relating to the Company’s ability to sustain its historical revenue growth given the deceleration of momentum in the
business amid a turbulent macroeconomic environment that has contributed to a meaningful decline in new ACV bookings
growth during fiscal year 2023;
 
•
risks related to the Company’s ability to meet public market analysts’ expectations of future growth, including the fact that
management’s forecasted revenue growth for fiscal year 2024 and 2025 in the Financial Forecasts is considerably lower than
public market analysts’ estimates;
 
•
challenges of making potential investments to achieve long-term growth prospects while a publicly traded company that is
subject to scrutiny based on its quarter-over-quarter performance, including the likely need for organizational changes to
optimize the Company’s business if the Company were to remain a standalone company;
 
•
the Company’s recent third quarter 2023 financial results, which were below certain analyst expectations of the Company’s
financial performance.
 
•
risks relating to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including
employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;

•
Process to explore a sale of the Company. The Board considered the process it undertook, with the assistance of its independent
financial advisor, for soliciting and responding to offers from the financial and strategic third parties that were believed to be the most
willing and able to pay the highest and best price for the Company, which included contacting, or responding to, 14 potential acquirors,
entering into non-disclosure agreements with seven potential acquirors, providing management presentations to five potential
acquirors, granting access to a data room containing detailed due diligence materials to four potential acquirors, receiving non-binding
offers from eight potential acquirors and receiving two final fully diligenced and financed proposals, one of which was from Thoma
Bravo, and the fact that, although several of the potential acquirors had noted the difficulty in obtaining financing and the terms
available in the current condition of the financing markets, Thoma Bravo had obtained committed debt and equity financing for the full
amount necessary to fund the aggregate merger consideration, including the fact that, despite the increased likelihood of interested
third parties as a result of Bloomberg’s publication of an article on November 23, 2022 stating that a certain financial sponsor was
exploring an acquisition of the Company, no other potential acquirors provided the Company with a proposal superior to that of Thoma
Bravo, as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation; Change in Board
Recommendation”, in each case as further described above under the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Background of the
Merger”.
 
•
Strategic alternatives to a sale of the Company. The Board considered the potential risks, benefits and uncertainties associated with
remaining an independent public company as a possible strategic alternative to the sale of the entire Company (including the potential
value to Company stockholders based on the Company’s strategic plan that could be expected to be generated from remaining an
independent public company). Based on the foregoing, the Board determined that such alternatives were not likely to create more value
on a risk-adjusted basis than the merger consideration for the foreseeable future.
 
•
Negotiations with interested parties. The Board considered the course and history of competitive, extensive and arm’s-length
negotiations with two third parties that submitted fully diligenced and fully

financed offers, which negotiations the Board believed resulted in the Company obtaining the highest and best price that the Thoma
Bravo Fund was willing to pay for the Company, as evidenced by the Company’s ability to increase the Thoma Bravo Fund’s proposed
price per share of Company common stock from $75.00 in its November 17, 2022 initial written proposal to $81.00 per share in its
December 11, 2022 final offer, as further described above under the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Background of the
Merger”. It is the Board’s belief that, based on discussions with the Thoma Bravo Fund and other potential counterparties, the final
proposal submitted by the Thoma Bravo Fund represented the best and final offer and the highest price per share of Company common
stock that the Thoma Bravo Fund or any other potential counterparty would be willing to pay, particularly given the condition of the
financing markets and broader macroeconomic climate, and any request for a further price increase or solicitation of additional bids from
other third parties would have created a meaningful risk that the Thoma Bravo Fund might determine to withdraw its final proposal and
to terminate negotiations, in which event Company stockholders would lose the opportunity to obtain the proposed $81.00 per share of
Company common stock in cash being offered.
 
•
Financial conditions, results of operations and prospects of the Company. The Board considered the Company’s operating and
financial performance and its prospects, including certain prospective forecasts for the Company prepared by the Company’s senior
management, which reflect an application of various assumptions of senior management, and the inherent uncertainty of achieving
senior management’s prospective forecasts, as set forth below under the section of this proxy statement entitled “ —Certain Financial
Forecasts”, and that as a result the Company’s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially from senior management’s
forecasts. The Board also considered its assessment, taking into account the other factors described herein, of the Company’s value on
a standalone basis relative to the $81.00 per share of Company common stock to be paid in cash in connection with the merger, and the
possibility that the trading price of shares of Company common stock would not reach and sustain such price, or that doing so could
take a considerable period of time.
 
•
Economic conditions. The Board considered the then current state of the economy, debt financing markets and uncertainty
surrounding forecasted economic conditions in the near term and the long term, which could negatively affect the Company’s financial
performance.
 
•
Cash consideration. The Board considered the fact that the merger consideration is all cash, which provides certainty, immediate value
and liquidity to holders of Company common stock, especially when viewed against any internal or external risks and uncertainties
associated with the Company’s stand-alone strategy, immediately upon the closing of the merger. The Board weighed the certainty of
realizing a compelling value for shares of Company common stock by virtue of the merger against the uncertain prospect that the
trading value for the Company’s common stock would approach the merger consideration within the foreseeable future, which the
Board considered unlikely. In reaching such a conclusion, the Board considered a number of factors, including that the Company’s
market value immediately prior to the execution of the merger agreement likely reflected speculation on a potential acquisition of the
Company and that, if the Board were not to engage in a transaction, the Company’s market value would likely decline, potentially
significantly.
 
•
Opinion of Qatalyst Partners. The Board considered the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Board by representatives
of Qatalyst Partners, as well as the oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners, subsequently confirmed in writing, which written opinion is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, rendered to the Board, that as of December 11, 2022, and based upon and subject to the
various qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received by the
holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders, as set forth in such opinion as more fully described below in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”.
 
 
Coupa Software Incorporated

Table of Contents
•
Capabilities of Thoma Bravo. The Board considered the consolidated financial strength and industry expertise of Thoma Bravo,
including the successful track record that Thoma Bravo has developed in acquiring other companies, and in particular other public
companies.
 
•
Availability and certainty of financing. The Board considered the fact that the merger is not subject to a financing condition, that the
Thoma Bravo Fund has obtained committed debt financing for the merger from reputable financing sources, and that the Thoma Bravo
Fund has committed to make available and provide to Parent, pursuant to the equity commitment letter, the full amount necessary, along
with the committed debt financing, to fund the aggregate merger consideration, as further described below in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “—Financing of the Merger”. The Board also considered the fact that if any portion of the debt financing for the
merger becomes unavailable, Parent is required to use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing in an amount sufficient to
consummate the merger.
 
•
Merger agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the structure of the transaction,
the all-cash form of the merger consideration, the limited conditions to closing and the customary nature of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties. The Board further considered the course and nature of negotiations with Parent,
which were conducted at arm’s length and during which the Board was advised by experienced independent legal and financial
advisors. The Board took into account the terms of the merger agreement, including:
 
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company to seek specific performance of Parent’s obligations under the
merger agreement, including to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain debt financing;
 
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company, if the debt financing is available at closing, to force the equity
financing to be funded and Parent to consummate the merger;
 
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company, in response to certain unsolicited takeover proposals, to
furnish information to and conduct discussions and negotiations with third parties prior to the Company stockholder approval
under certain circumstances and, under certain conditions, to accept a superior proposal, and the Company’s corresponding
right to terminate the merger agreement (subject to the payment to Parent of the Company termination fee of $200 million and
certain rights of Parent to match the superior proposal) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the
consummation of such superior proposal;
 
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Board, prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the merger agreement
proposal, not to include, or to withdraw or modify in a matter adverse to Parent, its recommendation in the proxy statement to the
Company’s stockholders to vote to adopt the merger agreement under certain circumstances relating to a superior proposal or
intervening event, subject to payment to Parent of the Company termination fee of $200 million if Parent elects to terminate the
merger agreement in such circumstances, and that the amount of the Company termination fee is comparable to termination
fees in transactions of a similar size, is reasonable, would not likely deter competing bids and would not likely be required to be
paid unless the Company entered into a more favorable transaction;
 
•
the fact that the Thoma Bravo Fund has provided a limited guarantee, which supports Parent’s obligation to pay the Parent
termination fee to the extent payable, in favor of the Company as described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“—Financing of the Merger”; and
 
•
the other terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the debt and equity financing documents and the limited guarantee,
which were reviewed by the Board with the
 
 
56
Notice and Proxy Statement
Coupa Software Incorporated
Table of Contents
Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and the fact that such terms were the product of arm’s-length
negotiations between the parties.
 
•
Probability of consummation of the merger. The Board considered the high probability that the merger would be consummated in a
reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner, which could reduce the period during which the Company’s business would be subject
to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption. The Board based this consideration on, among other things, the absence
of a financing contingency and the $435 million Parent termination fee, payable to the Company if the merger agreement is terminated in
certain circumstances, payment of which is guaranteed by the Thoma Bravo Fund as described under “—Financing of the Merger—
Limited Guarantee” pursuant to the limited guarantee delivered by it, the Thoma Bravo Fund’s ability to complete large acquisition
transactions and Thoma Bravo’s experience with transactions in the software industry.
 
•
The Board’s unanimous approval. The Board considered the fact that resolutions approving the merger were unanimously approved by
the Board, which is comprised of a majority of independent directors who are not affiliated with the Company and are not employees of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
•
Stockholders’ ability to reject the merger. The Board considered the fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of Company
stockholders, and Company stockholders would be free to reject the merger by voting against the adoption of the merger agreement.
 
•
Appraisal rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under the DGCL to Company stockholders who do not vote
for approval of the merger agreement and who comply with all of the required procedures for perfecting appraisal rights under the DGCL
in connection with the merger, including the fact that such stockholders will have the right to demand appraisal and payment of the fair
value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“—Appraisal Rights”.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the merger agreement and
the merger, including the following material factors (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
 
•
Risks associated with failure to consummate the merger on a timely basis or at all. The Board considered the risks and costs to the
Company if the merger does not close on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all due to a failure of certain conditions,
including with respect to the required approval of the transaction by the required regulatory authorities, including:
 
•
the trading price of Company common stock may decline to the extent that the market price of the Company common stock
currently reflects positive market assumptions that the merger will be consummated;
 
•
the potential negative impact on the Company’s ability to attract, hire and retain key employees, as current and prospective
employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company following the merger;
 
•
the potential disruption to the Company’s business and distraction of its workforce and management team from day-to-day
operations and from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to the Company, in each case without realizing any of
the benefits of having the merger completed; and
 
•
reputational harm to the Company’s relationships with investors, customers, suppliers, business partners and other third
parties due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the merger.
 
•
Restrictions on the operation of our business. The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior
to the consummation of the merger, which may delay or prevent the
 
 
Coupa Software Incorporated
Notice and Proxy Statement
57
Table of Contents
Company from undertaking certain significant financing transactions and business opportunities that may arise or any other action that
it might otherwise take with respect to the operations and strategy of the Company, even if such actions would prove beneficial to the
Company.
 
•
Regulatory risk. The Board considered the risk that the parties may incur significant costs and material delays resulting from seeking
regulatory approvals and other clearances, consents and approvals necessary for consummation of the merger.
 
•
Ability to respond to alternative proposals. The Board considered the fact that the provisions of the merger agreement that restrict the
Company’s ability to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding alternative takeover proposals with third parties,
subject to specified exceptions, and that require the Company to negotiate with Parent (if Parent desires to propose revisions to the
merger agreement and negotiate) prior to the Company being able to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal. The
Board further considered the possibility that the Company’s obligation to pay the Company termination fee of $200 million to Parent
upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential acquirors from making an
alternative proposal to acquire the Company.
 
•
Transaction costs. The Board considered the significant costs involved in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and
consummating the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and integration costs, and the fact that if the merger is not
consummated, the Company may be required to bear such costs.
 
•
Future increases in the price of Company common stock. The Board considered the possibility that, although the merger provides the
Company stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium to the price at which Company common stock traded prior to the public
announcement of the merger, the price of Company common stock might have increased in the future to a price greater than the merger
consideration.
 
•
Litigation risk. The Board considered the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the merger agreement and the
consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated therein.
 
•
Tax treatment. The Board considered the fact that an all-cash transaction would be taxable to the holders of common stock that are U.S.
holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
•
Other risks. The Board considered various other risks associated with the merger and the business of the Company, as more fully
described above in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.
In addition, the Board was aware of and considered the fact that the Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company stockholders generally, as described more fully below in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “—Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material factors considered
by the Board. The Board unanimously reached the conclusion to (1) authorize and approve the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, (2)
determine that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders for the Company to enter into the merger agreement and declare the
merger agreement advisable, (3) direct that the Company submit the adoption of the merger agreement to a vote of the holders of Company common
stock in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and (4) resolve to recommend that the holders of Company common stock adopt the
merger agreement in light of the factors described above and other factors that the Board believed were appropriate. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered by the Board in connection with its evaluation of

Notice and Proxy Statement

Table of Contents
the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether
any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board. Rather, the Board
made its recommendation based on the totality of the information available to the Board, including discussions with, and questioning of, the
Company’s management and its financial and legal advisors. In considering the factors discussed above, individual members of the Board may have
given different weights to different factors.
This explanation of the Board’s reasons for its recommendations and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and,
therefore, should be read in light of the factors described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements”.
Certain Financial Forecasts",61,68
Coupa Software Inc_20230123_DEFM14A_20571922_4573621.Pdf,Certain Financial Forecasts,"Certain Financial Forecasts
Other than annual guidance—including the guidance included in the Company’s press release dated June 7, 2022, the update of such guidance in the
Company’s press release dated September 7, 2022 and the withdrawal of such guidance in the Company’s press release dated December 12, 2022
(collectively, the “2022 earnings guidance”) with respect to total revenues, subscription revenues, professional services and other revenues, income
from operations and net income per diluted share, some of which guidance the Company presents as a range—the Company does not, as a matter of
course, publicly disclose forecasts as to future performance, earnings or other results due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, the Company has included in this proxy statement a summary of certain financial forecasts of the Company that were furnished
to (1) the Board, Qatalyst Partners (the Company’s financial advisor) and Thoma Bravo in connection with the discussions concerning the proposed
merger and (2) certain other parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company.
The Financial Forecasts (as defined below) were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the
SEC regarding forward-looking statements or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).
No assurances can be made regarding future events and the estimates and assumptions underlying the Financial Forecasts involve judgments with
respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not
be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including,
among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industries in which the Company operates and
the risks and uncertainties described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements”, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside the control of the Company and, upon consummation of the merger,
will be beyond the control of Thoma Bravo, Parent and the surviving corporation. Company stockholders are urged to review the Company’s SEC
filings for a description of risk factors with respect to the Company’s business. There can be no assurance that the assumptions underlying the
Financial Forecasts will prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be realized. Actual results may differ materially from those reflected in
the Financial Forecasts, whether or not the merger is consummated. The inclusion in this proxy statement of the Financial Forecasts should not be
regarded as an indication that the Company, the Board, Qatalyst Partners, Thoma Bravo or any other person considered, or now consider, these
forecasts to be a reliable predictor of future results. The Financial Forecasts are not fact, and neither they nor any underlying assumptions should be
relied on as being indicative of future results. Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place reliance on this information. The Financial
Forecasts assumed that the Company would continue to operate as a standalone company and do not reflect any impacts of the merger.
Certain of the financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts are “non-GAAP financial measures.” These are financial performance measures
that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note
 
 
Coupa Software Incorporated
Notice and Proxy Statement
59Table of Contents
that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or
principles and do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.
Investors should also note that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement have no standardized meaning prescribed by
GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, the non-GAAP financial measures in
this proxy statement and the accompanying footnotes may be calculated differently from, and may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled
measures used by the Company’s competitors and other companies, or any similarly titled measures used by Thoma Bravo or any of its affiliates.
Due to the inherent limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a
substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The footnotes to the tables below
provide certain supplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.
The Financial Forecasts included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s management. Ernst & Young
LLP, the Company’s independent auditor, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the
accompanying Financial Forecasts and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. The Ernst & Young LLP report incorporated by reference in this document relates to the Company’s previously issued financial statements.
It does not extend to the Financial Forecasts and should not be read to do so.
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts were approved by the Board for use by Qatalyst Partners and were relied on
by Qatalyst Partners for its financial analysis in connection with the preparation of its opinion and by the Board for its consideration of the merger.
Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination
transaction, such as the Financial Forecasts, are excluded from the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures” under applicable SEC rules and
regulations. As a result, the Financial Forecasts are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would
otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of
these non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied on by the Board or Qatalyst Partners in connection with their respective
evaluations of the merger. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the
Financial Forecasts to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
By including in this proxy statement the Financial Forecasts below, neither the Company nor Thoma Bravo nor any of their respective
representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the
information contained in the Financial Forecasts. Accordingly, the Financial Forecasts should not be construed as financial guidance, nor relied on
as such, and the Financial Forecasts may differ in important respects from the 2022 earnings guidance, some of which guidance was presented as a
range when first issued, and all of which was subsequently withdrawn, and which the Company’s management prepared based on a different set of
assumptions. The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by the Company
that the information contained therein is material. The Financial Forecasts reflected the opinions, estimates and judgments of the Company’s
management at the time they were prepared and have not been updated to reflect any subsequent changes. NONE OF THE COMPANY, PARENT,
MERGER SUB OR THOMA BRAVO OR, AFTER CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, THE SURVIVING CORPORATION, UNDERTAKES ANY
OBLIGATION, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE FINANCIAL FORECASTS TO REFLECT
CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING SINCE THEIR PREPARATION, CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC OR INDUSTRY CONDITIONS OR THE
OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS ARE
SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR.

The Company’s management prepared nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information for the last quarter of fiscal year 2023 and fiscal years
2024 through 2028 (which we refer to as the “Financial Forecasts”) that were reviewed by the Board at its meeting held on November 29, 2022.
The Financial Forecasts were relied on by the Board in reaching its determination on December 11, 2022 to authorize and approve the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of the merger agreement, to declare the merger agreement advisable and to resolve to recommend that the
holders of Company common stock adopt the merger agreement and were the only forecasts prepared by management that were approved by the
Company for use by Qatalyst Partners in connection with rendering its oral opinion delivered to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated as of December 11, 2022, and performing its financial analysis in connection therewith, as summarized in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”. The Financial Forecasts were also made available to
Thoma Bravo and certain other parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company.
The following table sets forth a summary of the Financial Forecasts. The summary of the Financial Forecasts is not included in this proxy statement
to induce any Company stockholder to vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement proposal or approving any other proposals to be voted on at
the special meeting or to influence any Company stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not
to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares of Company common stock.

The Company retained Qatalyst Partners to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential transaction such as the merger and to evaluate
whether the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of
Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company selected
Qatalyst Partners to act as the Company’s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners’ long-standing relationship with the Company as well as
Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and the industry in which it
operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the Board
on December 11, 2022, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of the date
thereof and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the merger
consideration to be received pursuant to, and in

accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent)
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated December 11, 2022, to the Board
following the meeting of the Board.
The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated December 11, 2022, is attached hereto as Annex B and is incorporated by reference
herein. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and
qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. Company stockholders should read the opinion carefully in
its entirety. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of
shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the
merger. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company common stock should vote with respect to the merger
or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company common stock will trade or otherwise be transferable at any
time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, certain related documents and certain publicly available
financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the Financial Forecasts prepared
by the management of the Company, described in the section above entitled “—Certain Financial Forecasts.” Additionally, Qatalyst Partners
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company.
Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company common stock and compared the financial performance
of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and
their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With
respect to the Financial Forecasts, Qatalyst Partners was advised by the management of the Company, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on
discussions with the management of the Company and the Board, that the Financial Forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other
matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners expressed no view as to the Financial Forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. Qatalyst
Partners assumed that the terms of the draft merger agreement reviewed by Qatalyst Partners would not differ materially from the final executed
merger agreement, and that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without any
modification, waiver or delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the merger,
no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits
expected to be derived in the merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners
relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and
products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion has been approved by its opinion
committee in accordance with its customary practice.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the

opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners has not assumed any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the
merger, or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion
is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst Partners
expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of the
Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated December 11, 2022.
The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering
all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For purposes of its
analyses, Qatalyst Partners utilized both the Financial Forecasts, described in the section above entitled “—Certain Financial Forecasts” and third-
party research analyst consensus estimates as of December 9, 2022 (which are referred to as the “street case”). Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand
the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth
below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential per-share present values
for Company common stock as of October 31, 2022 (which is the end of the Company’s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance
sheet date) by:
 
•
adding:
 
(a)
the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows (which are referred to as the “UFCF”) of the
Company, based on the Financial Forecasts for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2027 (which implied
present value was calculated using a range of discount rates of 9.5% to 13.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of
capital for the Company);
 
(b)
the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of the Company, calculated by multiplying the Company’s
estimated UFCF in fiscal year 2028 of approximately $360 million, based on the Financial Forecasts (assuming a long-term cash tax
rate of 15%, as provided by management of the Company), by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months’
estimated UFCF multiples of 20.0x to 32.0x (which were chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment and
experience), and discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above;
 
(c)
the cash and cash equivalents of the Company as of October 31, 2022, as provided by management of the Company; and
 
(d)
the implied net present value of estimated federal tax savings due to its net operating losses for the fiscal years 2028 and beyond,
as provided by management of the Company, discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a)
above; and
 
•
subtracting:
 
(a)
the face value of the outstanding Convertible Notes as of October 31, 2022, and the Company’s redeemable non-controlling
interests in Coupa K.K. (the Company’s Japanese joint venture), as of October 31, 2022, as provided by management of the
Company; and

•
dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock outstanding (calculated using the
treasury stock method, taking into account the restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and in-the-money stock
options, as of December 8, 2022, and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money Convertible Notes) as of October 31, 2022, and is
pro-forma for the net-share settlement of the outstanding capped calls related to the 2023 Convertible Notes due January 15, 2023, all as
provided by management of the Company, with each of the above-referenced estimated future UFCFs, terminal value and federal tax
savings due to net operating losses for the fiscal years 2028 and beyond having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution
to current stockholders through each respective applicable period (which totaled approximately 13% in the case of the terminal value)
due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of
future dilution provided by management of the Company.
Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $40.30 to $79.42 per
share.
Selected Companies Analysis
Qatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for the Company with publicly available financial
information and public market multiples for selected companies. The companies used in this comparison were those companies listed below, which
were selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of
business to the Company, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have other relevant or similar characteristics.
Based upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates as of December 9, 2022 and using the closing prices as of December 9, 2022 for shares
of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus
revenue for calendar year 2023 (which are referred to as the “CY2023E revenue multiples”), for each of the selected companies, as shown below:

Partners selected a representative multiple range of 3.8x to 7.0x.
Qatalyst Partners then applied this range to the Company’s estimated revenue for calendar year 2023, based on the Financial Forecasts and based on
the street case. Based on the fully diluted shares of Company common stock

outstanding as of December 8, 2022 (calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above discounted cash flow analysis), this analysis
implied (a) a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $27.70 to $64.54 per share based on the Financial Forecasts for calendar
year 2023 and (b) a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $29.48 to $67.81 per share based on the street case for calendar year
2023.
No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters.
Many of these matters are beyond the control of the Company, such as the impact of competition on the Company’s business or the industry in
general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in
the financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is
not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Qatalyst Partners compared fifty-one selected public company transactions, including transactions involving companies participating in similar lines
of business to the Company or with similar business models, similar financial performance or other relevant or similar characteristics.
For each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (a) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of the
target company as a multiple of last-twelve-months’ revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the “LTM revenue multiples”) and (b)
the implied fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-
months’ revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the “NTM revenue multiples”).

Company’s last-twelve months’ revenue (calculated as the four quarters ended on October 31, 2022). Based on the fully diluted shares of Company
common stock outstanding as of December 8, 2022 (calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above discounted cash flow analysis,
with the exception of assuming cash settlement of the Convertible Notes with an assumed make whole adjustment and cash settlement of the capped
calls related to the 2025 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes based on a Black-Scholes option calculation model), as provided by
management of the Company, this analysis implied a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $43.13 to $92.31 per share.
Based on the analysis of the NTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a
representative multiple range of 5.5x to 9.5x, then applied this range to the Company’s estimated next-twelve-months’ revenue (calculated as the four
quarters ending on October 31, 2023) based on the street case. Based on the same fully diluted share count as used in the immediately preceding
paragraph, this analysis implied a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $47.07 to $92.83 per share.
No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to the Company or the merger. In evaluating the selected
transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company’s
business or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition and
prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value
of the transactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean,
median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected transactional data. Because of the unique circumstances of each of
these transactions and the merger, Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.
Miscellaneous
In connection with the review of the merger by the Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes
of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses
as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have
given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less
probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to
be Qatalyst Partners’ view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of the Company. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common
stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price at which
Company common stock might actually trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors considered by the Board in deciding to approve the merger
agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed
 
 
Coupa Software Incorporated

Table of Contents
as determinative of the opinion of the Board with respect to the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms
of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) or of whether the Board
would have been willing to agree to different consideration. The merger consideration payable in the merger was determined through arm’s-length
negotiations between the Company and Thoma Bravo and was approved by the Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to the Company during
these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to the Company or that any specific consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which
conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short
positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Thoma Bravo, Parent or certain of
their respective affiliates. During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst
Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company, Thoma Bravo or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its
affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company, Thoma
Bravo or Parent and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would expect to receive compensation.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided the Company with financial advisory services in connection with the merger
for which it will be paid an aggregate amount currently estimated at approximately $90 million, $5 million of which was payable upon delivery of its
opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, consummation
of the merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. The Company
has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and
any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws,
and certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners’ engagement.

If the Company stockholder approval is obtained, the other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
law) waived and the merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company upon the terms set forth in the merger agreement
and in accordance with the DGCL. As the surviving corporation in the merger, the Company will continue to exist following the merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.
At the effective time, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than excluded
shares and appraisal shares) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $81.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes. Company stockholders who properly and validly exercise and do not withdraw their appraisal rights will have a right to receive
payment of the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by the DGCL. For more information,
please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Appraisal Rights”. Following the merger, all of the Company common stock will be
beneficially owned by Parent, and none of the current Company stockholders will, by virtue of the merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a
stockholder of, the Company, the surviving corporation or Parent.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Consideration to be Received in the Merger”.

Shares of Company common stock are currently registered under the Exchange Act and listed on Nasdaq under the trading symbol “COUP”.
Following the consummation of the merger, shares of Company common stock will no longer be traded on Nasdaq or any other public market. In
addition, the registration of Company common stock under the Exchange Act is expected to be terminated, and, upon such termination, the Company
will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with respect to the Company common stock.

Coupa Software Inc_20230123_DEFM14A_20571922_4573621.Pdf,Effects on the Company if the Merger Is Not Consummated,"Effects on the Company if the Merger Is Not Consummated
In the event that the Company stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, Company
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Company common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will
remain an independent public company, the Company common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, the Company common stock
will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the Company stockholders will continue to own their shares of Company common stock
and will continue to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of the Company common
stock.
If the merger is not consummated, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your Company
common stock, including the risk that the market price of Company common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of the
Company common stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be consummated. If the merger is not consummated, there is no assurance
that any other transaction acceptable to the Company will be offered or that the business, operations, financial condition, earnings or prospects of
the Company will not be adversely impacted. Pursuant to the merger agreement, under certain circumstances the Company is permitted to terminate
the merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative transaction. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement
—Termination of the Merger Agreement”.
Under certain circumstances, if the merger is not consummated, the Company may be obligated to pay to Parent a $200 million termination fee and,
under certain other specified circumstances, Parent will be required to pay the Company the Parent termination fee of $435 million. Please see the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”.
Financing of the Merger",78,78
Coupa Software Inc_20230123_DEFM14A_20571922_4573621.Pdf,Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
We presently anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the merger and the related transactions will be approximately $8.3 billion, which will
be funded via equity and debt financing described below.
The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is not subject to any financing condition. Parent and Merger Sub have
represented to the Company that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions in the merger agreement, they will have available to them sufficient
funds to satisfy all of their obligations under the merger agreement on the closing date and under the commitment letters. This includes funds
needed to: (1) pay the Company’s stockholders the amounts due under the merger agreement for their Company common stock, (2) make payments in
respect of all outstanding Company Options, Company RSUs, and Company PSUs payable at the closing of the merger pursuant to the merger
agreement and (3) repayment or refinancing of certain indebtedness, including payments of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
merger pursuant to the Convertible Note Indentures and the Convertible Notes issued pursuant thereto.
Parent and Merger Sub have obtained committed financing consisting of (1) equity to be provided by the Thoma Bravo Fund pursuant to the terms
of the equity commitment letter and (2) debt financing to be provided pursuant
 
 
Coupa Software Incorporated
Notice and Proxy Statement
69Table of Contents
to the debt commitment letter by the Lenders. In connection with the merger agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company
copies of the commitment letters. Notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, in no event will the receipt or availability of any
funds or financing (including the financing contemplated by the commitment letters) by or to Parent or any of its affiliates or any other financing
transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the merger agreement.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the equity commitment letter, the Thoma Bravo Fund has committed to contribute or cause to be contributed to Parent at the closing of
the merger certain equity financing for the purpose of funding the Required Amounts. The obligations of the Thoma Bravo Fund to provide the
equity financing under the equity commitment letter is subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to (1) the execution and delivery
of the merger agreement, (2) satisfaction or written waiver by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, of each of the conditions to the
obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger set forth in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 of the merger agreement (other
than any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of these conditions at such time),
(3) the substantially concurrent consummation of the merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and (4) the receipt of the debt
financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter or, if applicable, a new financing commitment letter (“new debt commitment letter”) with
respect to alternative debt financing providing that the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter or, if applicable, the new debt
commitment letter, will be funded at the closing of the merger if the equity financing under the equity commitment letter is consummated at the
closing of the merger. We refer to the equity financing described in the preceding sentence as the “equity financing.”
The obligation of the Thoma Bravo Fund to fund the equity commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon the earliest to occur of (1)
the consummation of the closing of the merger and the payment of the aggregate merger consideration in accordance with the merger agreement, (2)
the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms and (3) the occurrence of any event that, by the terms of the limited
guaranty, is an event that terminates the Thoma Bravo Fund’s obligations or liabilities under the limited guarantee.
The Company is an express third-party beneficiary of the equity commitment letter solely with respect to enforcing Parent’s right to cause the
commitment under the equity commitment letter by the Thoma Bravo Fund to be funded to Parent in accordance with the equity commitment letter,
and to cause Parent to enforce its rights against the Thoma Bravo Fund to perform its funding obligations under the equity commitment letter, in
each case subject to (1) the limitations and conditions set forth in the equity commitment letter and (2) the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement.
Debt Financing
The debt commitment letter provides that the Lenders will provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment
letter, debt financing (the “debt financing”).
The debt financing consists of: (1) a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and (2) a senior secured term loan
facility (together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility will be used (a) to effect the merger and related
transactions on the closing date, (2) to effect the Company’s offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes pursuant to the Convertible Note Indentures,
(3) to pay fees and expenses related to the merger and related transactions and (4) for working capital, capital expenditures and other general
corporate purposes.

If the merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the merger consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Company
common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair
value of their shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your
shares of Company common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the merger consideration that you
are otherwise entitled to receive under the merger agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice
of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement.
They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Company common stock following petition to, and an appraisal by,
the Delaware Court. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Company common stock
determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all
of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the
complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors
before attempting to exercise such rights.
A copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. This summary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires to
exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should carefully review Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal and financial advisors before
electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a
recommendation that persons seek to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. As used in this section entitled “Appraisal Rights”, the word
“stockholder” means a holder of record of shares of Company common stock, the words “beneficial owner” mean a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of Company common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person and the word “person” means any
individual corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to
receive the merger consideration under the merger agreement.
A holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock who (1) continuously holds such shares through the effective time, (2)
has not voted in favor of or otherwise consented to the merger in writing or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (3) strictly complies
with the procedures under Section 262, (4) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (5) in the case of a
beneficial owner, a person who (a) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (b)
provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial

ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (c) provides an address at which
such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined below), will be entitled
to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value.
Section 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the stockholders be notified that
appraisal rights will be available not less than 20 days before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section
262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription
or cost. This proxy statement constitutes the Company’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger,
in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of
Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in
the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.
If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Company common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: you must deliver to
the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Company common stock before the taking of the vote on the merger, which demand
must reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of Company common stock who intends to demand appraisal of his, her or
its shares of Company common stock and, for beneficial owners only, such demand must be accompanied by documentary evidence of such
beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and
must provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List;
you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; you must hold your shares of Company common stock
continuously through the effective time; and you must comply with the other applicable requirements of Section 262.
A Company stockholder or beneficial owner who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail his, her or its written demand for appraisal to the
following address:

Attention: Corporate Secretary
A record holder who holds shares of Company common stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, may
exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the record
owner. In such case, the demand must set forth the number of shares of Company common stock covered by such demand. Where the number of
shares of Company common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Company common stock outstanding
in the name of such record owner. If you hold your shares of Company common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish such
holder, as the holder of record of your shares of Company common stock, to exercise appraisal rights on your behalf, you should consult with your
bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker
or other nominee.
Within ten days after the effective time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the merger has become effective to each of (1) each
Company stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and (2) any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within 60 days after the effective time, any
person who

Table of Contents
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and accept the merger consideration
specified by the merger agreement for that person’s shares of Company common stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a written
withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation and any person who has properly and timely demanded
appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy
appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy
served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder or beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock,
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of Company common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no
present intent on the part of the Company or the surviving corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights
should assume that the Company and the surviving corporation will not file such a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value
of shares of Company common stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to have their shares of Company common stock appraised should initiate
any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within 120
days after the effective time, no petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded
appraisal will become entitled only to the merger consideration under the merger agreement.
In addition, within 120 days after the effective time, any person who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be
entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Company
common stock not voted in favor of the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the surviving corporation and the
aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand for
appraisal, the record holder of such shares will not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate
number). Such statement must be given within ten days after the written request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation or within
ten days after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.
Upon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving corporation
shall be required to, within 20 days after such service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of Company common stock and with whom the
surviving corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (the “Chancery List”). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by
the Delaware Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving
corporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court will determine which persons have
complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares of Company common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates of
shares of Company common stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any person
fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If immediately before the merger, the shares
of the class or series of stock of the corporation were listed on a national securities exchange, the Delaware Court will dismiss the appraisal
proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal
exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such
total number of shares exceeds $1 million.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the Delaware Court may, in its
discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of

Notice and Proxy Statement
Coupa Software Incorporated
Table of Contents
the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Chancery List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court, including
any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of
Company common stock taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its discretion,
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time through the
date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings,
the surviving corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such payment
only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of Company common stock as determined
by the Delaware Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the surviving corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the
person.
When the fair value of the shares of Company common stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of such value, with interest
thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.
Although the Company believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower
than, or the same as, the merger consideration. Moreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the merger consideration
to any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the “fair
value” of the relevant shares of Company common stock is less than the merger consideration.
In determining “fair value”, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme
Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme
Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the
nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future
prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that]
does not encompass known elements of value”, but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment
or expectation.
In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, the
Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting person’s
exclusive remedy.
The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court deems equitable in
the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys’ and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys’ and
expert witness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the proceeding and
incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of such expenses,

including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Company common
stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction
under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware Court are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
From and after the effective time, no person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will be entitled to vote for any purpose
any shares of Company common stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for
dividends or distributions payable to Company stockholders at a date prior to the effective time.
No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval
may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application
to the Court made under Section 262(j) of the DGCL; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after the effective time. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within one hundred
twenty (120) days after the effective time, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled
only to the merger consideration under the merger agreement.
To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the other hand, Section 262 will
govern.",81,85

The Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the
Company stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to adopt the
merger agreement and to recommend that Company stockholders approve the merger agreement proposal.
The Company’s executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are Robert Bernshteyn (Chief Executive Officer, Director and Chair of the
Board), Anthony Tiscornia (Chief Financial Officer), Robert Glenn (Executive Vice President, Global Sales), Mark Riggs (Chief Customer Officer) and
Todd Ford (former President, Finance and Operations). Mr. Ford transitioned to a non-executive role effective April 1, 2022 and continues to provide
transition and advisory services as an employee of the Company. The Company’s directors for purposes of the discussion below are Michelle
Brennan, Roger Siboni, Kanika Soni, Tayloe Stansbury, Scott Thompson, Frank Van Veenendaal and Leslie Campbell. Mrs. Campbell retired from the
Board as of the annual meeting of Company stockholders in 2022 and has no interests in the merger different from those interests of the Company
shareholders generally.
Treatment of Company Common Stock and Equity Awards
For information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of Company common stock by each of the Company’s directors and executive officers
and all of such directors and executive officers as a group, please see the section entitled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management”. Each of the Company’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to receive, for each share of Company common stock he or she
holds, the same per share merger consideration in cash in the same manner as other Company stockholders.
Company Options
Each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, vested (including any Company Option that vests automatically solely as a result of the
merger) and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock for which such vested Company Option has not then been exercised

multiplied by the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price of such vested Company Option, except that any vested
Company Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will, as of the effective time, be canceled for
no consideration.
Each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and
replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock for which such
unvested Company Option has not then been exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price
of such unvested Company Option, which cash amount will continue to vest on substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the
replaced Company Option, subject to the holder’s continued employment with Parent and its affiliates (including the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries), except that any unvested Company Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will,
as of the effective time, be canceled for no consideration.
Company RSUs
Each Company RSU that is unexpired, unsettled and vested (including any Company RSU that vests automatically solely as a result of the merger) or
that is deemed to be vested as described in the following sentence, in each case, outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, will be
canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock subject
to such vested Company RSU or deemed vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by the merger consideration.
A percentage of each unvested Company RSU that was granted on or prior to December 11, 2022, is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time and would have vested on or prior to January 31, 2024 (such Company RSU, a “Near-Term Company RSU”) will be accelerated and
deemed vested as of immediately prior to the effective time.
The percentage of each Near-Term Company RSU that will be accelerated and deemed vested will be based on a ratio of $65 million to the total value
of all shares of Company common stock underlying each Near-Term Company RSU, multiplied by the merger consideration. Based on the total value
of all Near-Term Company RSUs outstanding as of January 19, 2023 (the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement) and
assuming that no Near-Term Company RSUs vest or are forfeited following January 19, 2023, the percentage of each Near-Term Company RSU that
would be accelerated and deemed vested is equal to approximately 43%. The actual percentage of Near-Term Company RSUs that are accelerated and
deemed vested will not be known until the closing of the merger and will be based on the actual number of Near-Term Company RSUs outstanding at
such time. Once the percentage described above has been calculated, it will be applied pro rata to each Near-Term Company RSU on each regularly
scheduled vesting date between the closing date and January 31, 2024.
Each Company RSU that remains unexpired, unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than any deemed vested
Company RSU described above) will be canceled and replaced with an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company
common stock subject to such unvested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by the merger consideration, which
cash amount will continue to vest on substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the replaced unvested Company RSU, subject to the
holder’s continued employment with Parent and its affiliates (including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries).
Company PSUs
Each Company PSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (or is otherwise described in the
following sentence) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the number of shares of
Company common stock subject to such Company PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time (with such number of shares generally
determined by deeming the applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of target performance and actual performance, with actual
performance determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement), multiplied by the merger consideration, except that each
Company PSU granted to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer

on July 28, 2022 will be canceled for no consideration in accordance with its terms. In the event that a Company PSU granted on March 20, 2020 is
forfeited prior to March 20, 2023 in accordance with its terms due to the failure to achieve the applicable performance-based vesting condition,
subject to the holder of each such forfeited Company PSU remaining employed by the Company through the effective time, such forfeited Company
PSU will be treated as an outstanding Company PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time.
As of January 19, 2023 (the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement) and assuming that (1) all Company equity awards are
valued based on the merger consideration of $81.00 per share, and (2) the directors do not receive any Company equity awards or forfeit any
Company equity awards following January 19, 2023, each of the Company’s current non-employee directors held 2,470 unvested Company RSUs
with a value of $200,070, which Company RSUs will accelerate and become vested immediately prior to the effective time pursuant to the Company’s
compensation program for non-employee directors. None of the Company’s current non-employee directors holds unvested Company Options or
unvested Company PSUs. Mrs. Campbell, who is no longer a Company director, does not hold any Company equity awards.
The Company’s executive officers hold vested Company Options, which are included in the section entitled “Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Owners and Management”, and unvested Company Options, all of which have an exercise price that is greater than the merger
consideration and will be canceled for no consideration. See “— Quantification of Payments and Benefits” below for the estimated value of the
Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by each of the Company’s executive officers.
Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan
If the effective time occurs prior to the end of any outstanding offering period under the Company ESPP, all outstanding purchase rights under the
Company ESPP will automatically be exercised, in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, no later than five business days prior to the
effective time and the Company ESPP will terminate at such time. Each share of Company common stock purchased on the final purchase date will be
canceled at the effective time and converted into the right to receive the same per share merger consideration in cash in the same manner as other
Company stockholders (less applicable tax withholding). The following table sets forth the estimated number of shares of Company common stock
that may be purchased under the Company ESPP assuming that each executive officer will purchase shares of Company common stock on March 15,
2023 (the current purchase date under the Company ESPP) based on accumulated payroll deductions as of January 19, 2023 (the latest practicable
date before the filing of this proxy statement) at approximately $57.44 per share, which represents a 15% discount to the offering price as determined
under the Company ESPP, which is estimated to be $67.58 per share, and the estimated value of such shares of Company common stock based on the
merger consideration of $81.00 per share.

Agreement”). Each Severance Agreement (other than Mr. Ford’s Severance

Agreement, which is described below) provides that if the executive is terminated by the Company without “cause” or the executive resigns for
“good reason” (as defined in the applicable Severance Agreement) (each, a “Qualifying Termination”), in each case within the period beginning three
months prior to and ending 12 months following a change in control of the Company (the “CIC Protection Period”), such as the merger, the executive
would receive (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of the executive’s base salary plus the executive’s target annual bonus (or 18
months’ annual base salary plus 150% of target bonus for Mr. Bernshteyn) and (2) payment or reimbursement for the cost of continued health
insurance coverage for the executive and the executive’s eligible dependents for up to 12 months (or up to 18 months for Mr. Bernshteyn). In
addition, unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, 100% of the unvested portion of each executive’s outstanding Company
equity awards would vest in full, and in the case of Company PSUs, performance would be deemed achieved at the greater of target performance and
actual performance unless otherwise set forth in an applicable award agreement.
Each of the foregoing severance payments and benefits is subject to the executive officer’s execution of a general release of claims. In addition,
pursuant to their respective Severance Agreements, in the event that any payment or benefit payable to an executive officer would constitute a
parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), then the executive officer
would either receive all such payments and benefits in full or such payments and benefits would be reduced to the greatest amount that does not
trigger the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, whichever results in the greater after-tax amount for the executive officer.
Transition Agreement and Severance Agreement with Mr. Ford
In connection with his transition to a non-executive role effective April 1, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Ford (the
“Transition Agreement”), pursuant to which Mr. Ford will continue to provide transition and advisory services as an employee of the Company for a
one-year term, which may be extended by mutual agreement. Pursuant to the Transition Agreement, upon the conclusion of Mr. Ford’s transitional
services, Mr. Ford will be entitled to payment or reimbursement for the cost of continued health insurance coverage for him and his eligible
dependents for up to six months, regardless of whether a change in control of the Company occurs. In addition, pursuant to Mr. Ford’s Severance
Agreement, he will automatically experience a Qualifying Termination on a change in control of the Company, such as the merger, and will be entitled
to accelerated vesting of Company equity awards as described above. Mr. Ford is not eligible to participate in the Company’s bonus program and is
not entitled to any cash severance under his Transition Agreement or his Severance Agreement.
See “—Quantification of Payments and Benefits” below for the estimated value of the severance payments and benefits that may be become
payable to the Company’s executive officers.
New Management Arrangements
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers have entered into any agreement or engaged in discussions with Parent or any
of its affiliates regarding employment or compensation arrangements with Parent and its affiliates on a going forward basis. Prior to or following the
closing of the merger, certain of our executive officers may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with Parent or one of its affiliates
regarding employment or compensation arrangements with Parent and its affiliates, but the merger is not conditioned upon any such agreements or
discussions.
Parent and the Company have agreed that for the benefit of the Company’s existing employees, including the Company’s executive officers (other
than the Chief Executive Officer), the Company may grant up to 987,654 Company RSUs in fiscal year 2024 in the ordinary course of business as part
of its annual fiscal performance review process and subject to the Company’s standard award agreements. Any Company RSUs granted after entry
into the merger agreement that are unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time

(which we refer to as “Newly Granted RSUs”) will be treated in the same manner as all other unvested Company RSUs as described above, except no
such Newly Granted RSUs will be subject to accelerated vesting (partial or otherwise) at the effective time other than in connection with a Qualifying
Termination pursuant to the Severance Agreements.
Director and Officer Indemnification
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, members of the Board and officers of the Company will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification
and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies following the merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the
merger agreement relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—
Indemnification and Insurance”.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company’s named executive officers estimates of the
amounts of compensation that are payable in connection with or otherwise relate to the merger. The Company stockholders are being asked to
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be
binding on either the Company, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the merger agreement proposal is approved by the Company stockholders and
the merger is consummated, the compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject only to
the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above under “—Interests of the Company’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The estimated values are based on (1) an
assumption that the merger is consummated on March 31, 2023, (2) the per share merger consideration of $81.00, (3) the named executive officers’
salary as in effect as of January 19, 2023, (4) the number of unvested Company equity awards held by the named executive officers as of January 19,
2023 (the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement), and assuming no additional grants, vesting or forfeitures of Company
equity awards will occur following January 19, 2023, and (5) an assumption that each named executive officer experiences a termination of
employment immediately following the consummation of the merger under circumstances that entitle such named executive officer to receive
severance (i.e., a termination without “cause” or resignation for “good reason”).
As such, the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions
described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the consummation of the merger. As a
result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

(1)
The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated value of the cash severance each named executive officer is eligible to receive upon
a Qualifying Termination within the CIC Protection Period. For Mr. Bernshteyn, the cash severance payment consists of an amount equal to 18
months of his annual base salary, plus 150% of his target annual bonus, payable in a lump-sum. For Messrs. Tiscornia, Riggs and Glenn, the
cash severance payment consists of an amount equal to 12 months of the executive officer’s annual base salary, plus 100% of his target bonus,
payable in a lump-sum. Each such named executive officer’s cash severance payment is a “double-trigger” payment, as it would only be
payable in the event of a Qualifying Termination within the CIC Protection Period. Mr. Ford is not entitled to any cash severance payments.
(2)
The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated aggregate value of each named executive officer’s unvested Company RSUs and
unvested Company PSUs (assuming deemed achievement at target levels of performance) as further detailed in the table below. The estimated
payments in respect of each named executive officer’s Company RSUs that are accelerated and deemed vested as of immediately prior to the
effective time and Company PSUs are “single-trigger” payments, as such payments will be made shortly after the effective time regardless of
whether the executive officer experiences a Qualifying Termination within the CIC Protection Period. The estimated payments in respect of all
other Company RSUs are “double-trigger” payments, which would only be payable subject to the named executive officer’s Qualifying
Termination within the CIC Protection Period (which, for Mr. Ford, will occur at the effective time). The estimated amounts shown in this
column do not include the value of Company PSUs granted to Mr. Bernshteyn on July 28, 2022, which will be canceled without consideration at
the effective time in accordance with their terms, and also do not include unvested Company Options, because all such Company Options held
by the Company’s named executive officers have an exercise price that is greater than the merger consideration of $81.00. The actual value of
the Company PSUs may be more than the estimated values reflected in this column if actual performance as of the effective time is greater than
target performance.

The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated value of health insurance premiums payable by the Company on behalf of each
named executive officer and his covered dependents for up to 18 months in the case of Mr. Bernshteyn and up to 12 months in the case of
Messrs. Tiscornia, Riggs and Glenn. Each such payment is a “double-trigger” payment, as it would only be payable in the event of a Qualifying
Termination within the CIC Protection Period. Mr. Ford is entitled to up to six months’ continuation of Company-paid health insurance
premiums for himself and his dependents upon the conclusion of his transitional services, regardless of whether a change in control occurs,
and, as a result, such amount is not included in this column.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",85,91

The following discussion is a general summary based on present law of U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to holders with respect to the
disposition of Company common stock pursuant to the merger. This summary is not a complete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger and does not address consequences to holders of Company equity awards; it is not a substitute for tax
advice. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), all of which are subject to
change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions
set forth herein. The Internal Revenue Service may not agree with the tax consequences described in this discussion.
This discussion assumes that Company stockholders hold their shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of
Company common stock in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including Company stockholders subject to special rules, such as, banks
or other financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities (including
S-corporations) and their owners, tax-exempt entities, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market, controlled foreign corporations, certain former U.S. citizens and lawful permanent
residents of the United States, holders who acquired their shares of Company common stock through vesting of units or otherwise as compensation,
holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, holders who hold their shares of Company common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion,
constructive sale or other integrated financial transaction, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, accrual
method holders who prepare an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in Section 451 of the Code) and persons that directly, indirectly or
constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of the Company’s voting stock or of the total value of the Company’s equity
interests. This summary also does not address U.S. federal taxes other than the income tax (such as the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare
contribution tax on “net investment income” or estate or gift taxes) or U.S. state and local, or non-U.S. tax laws or considerations.
If an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds common stock, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of the partnership and a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the status and activities of the
partnership. A partner of a partnership holding common stock, should consult their own tax advisor as to the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences in light of the transaction.
All holders should consult their own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including the application and effect of any
state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of common stock, that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (1) a citizen or
individual resident of the United States; (2) a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (3) a trust if (a) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within
the United States and one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust or (b) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal
income tax purposes; or (4) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity classified as a partnership that is subject to U.S. federal income tax
reporting) of Company common stock that is not a U.S. holder.

Coupa Software IncorporatedTable of Contents
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder will generally recognize
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger and
such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company common stock converted into cash pursuant to the merger. Such gain or loss will
generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the
date of the merger. Long-term capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for reduced rates of
U.S. federal income taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of
Company common stock at different times or at different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss
separately with respect to each block of common stock.
A U.S. holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding with respect to the cash received
pursuant to the merger, unless such holder properly establishes an exemption. Backup withholding may apply to payments subject to information
reporting if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number and certify that it is not subject to backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld will generally be refunded or credited against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income
tax liability, if any; provided the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax
unless:
 
•
the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if required by an applicable income tax
treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by
such non-U.S. holder), in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S.
holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. corporation, such corporation may be subject to branch profits tax at the rate of 30% on
the effectively connected gain (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty);
 
•
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax at a 30% rate (or a lower
applicable income tax treaty rate) on any gain derived from the disposition of the Company common stock pursuant to the merger (other
than gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses; or
 
•
the Company common stock constitutes a “United States real property interest” (“USRPI”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes under
the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”).
If shares of Company common stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, a non-U.S. holder would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain or
loss recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for such shares of Company common stock in the merger on a net basis at applicable U.S.
graduated rates in the same manner as a U.S. holder, and such cash consideration may also be subject to the U.S. federal withholding tax under
FIRPTA at a rate of 15%. A non-U.S. holder’s shares of Company common stock generally will not constitute a USRPI, and gain recognized by a non-
U.S. holder upon receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S.
federal income or U.S. federal withholding tax under FIRPTA, if shares of Company common stock are “regularly traded” (within the meaning of
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations) on an established securities market at the effective time (and the non-U.S. holder

holds 5% or less of the total fair market value of such class of shares at all times during the shorter of (x) the five-year period ending with the
effective date of the merger and (y) the non-U.S. holder’s holding period for the shares). We believe we have not been a “United States real property
holding corporation” for United States federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger.
Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules in light of their particular facts and
circumstances, the procedures for claiming treaty benefits or otherwise establishing an exemption from U.S. withholding tax with respect to any
portion of the cash consideration payable to them pursuant to the merger.
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding will apply with respect to the cash
received by such holder pursuant to the merger, unless such non-U.S. holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the
payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person as defined under the Code) or such holder
otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such non-
U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

Three purported Company stockholders have filed complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Northern California and the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the merger: Bharat Hedge v. Coupa Software Inc., et al., No. 3:23-cv-
00181 (N.D. Cal. filed Jan. 13, 2023); Ryan O’Dell v. Coupa Software Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-00329 (S.D.N.Y. filed Jan. 13, 2023); and Douglas Popejoy
v. Coupa Software Inc., et al., No. 3:23-cv-00209 (N.D. Cal. filed Jan. 18, 2023). The complaints name the Company and its directors as defendants,
and allege, among other things, that the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement that is materially misleading in violation of Section 14(a) and
20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaints seek, among other relief, an injunction preventing the defendants from consummating the merger unless
additional disclosures are made, rescission of the merger in the event the merger is consummated or awarding of rescissory damages, relief directing
the defendants to account to plaintiffs for all damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations, and an award of costs and disbursements,
including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses.
In addition, the Company has received two demand letters from purported Company stockholders similarly alleging that the Company filed a
preliminary proxy statement that is materially misleading.
The Company believes the claims asserted in the lawsuits and the demand letters are without merit. Additional lawsuits and demand letters arising
out of the merger may also be filed or received in the future.

The parties to the merger agreement are obligated to cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly,
amongst other things, (1) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from any
governmental authority or third party necessary to consummate the transactions, (2) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions and (3) defend or contest in good faith any action brought by a third party that could otherwise prevent or impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the consummation of the transactions, as described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Reasonable Best Efforts”. The management of each of the Parent and the Company currently believe that the
necessary regulatory approvals can be obtained in the first or second quarter of 2023; however, there can be no assurances that such approvals will
be obtained in accordance with this timing or at all.

Coupa Software IncorporatedTable of Contents
HSR Act Clearance
Consummation of the merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the FTC, which prevent
transactions such as the merger from being consummated until (1) certain information and materials are furnished to the DOJ and the FTC and (2) the
applicable waiting period is terminated early or expires. The FTC and DOJ currently have suspended the practice of granting early termination under
the HSR Act. Both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ on December 21, 2022.
The waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act expired on January 20, 2023.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the
FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin
the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or
terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, any state could take such action
under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the
merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under
certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Non-U.S. Regulatory Approvals
Consummation of the merger also is subject to receipt of certain additional consents, approvals or other clearances (unless excluded by waiver
mutually agreed between the parties, if permissible under applicable law), consisting of receipt of a clearance decision by (1) Germany pursuant to
Section 39 (1) of the Act against Restraints of Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen), (2) Austria pursuant to Section 10b (1)
Austrian Competition Act in connection with Section 10 (3) No. 2 Austrian Cartel Act and (3) South Africa pursuant to the Competition Act No. 89 of
1998. The Company and Parent also made the required filings with Germany, Austria, and South Africa. The Company and Parent have obtained
clearance for the consummation of the merger in Germany and Austria on January 10, 2023 and January 20, 2023, respectively.
In each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or desirable,
including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will
prevail.
Additional Approvals
In addition, the parties expect to submit a notice of the transactions to the U.S. Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (the “DCSA”) and
the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”).
The Company and Parent also intend to make all required filings under the Exchange Act relating to the merger and obtain all other approvals and
consents that may be necessary to give effect to the merger.

The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, each issued and outstanding share of Company common stock (other than excluded
shares and appraisal shares) will be canceled and converted automatically into and will thereafter represent only the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to $81.00 per share, without interest. As of the effective time, each holder of Company common stock will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the merger consideration to be paid in consideration therefor.
If, between December 11, 2022 and the effective time, the number of shares of outstanding Company common stock changes into a different number
of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock split, reverse share split, dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change, then the merger consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to the merger agreement will be equitably adjusted as necessary to reflect such event.

•
each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, vested (including any Company Option that vests automatically solely as a result
of the merger) and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock for which such vested Company Option has
not then been exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price of such vested
Company Option, except that any vested Company Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the merger
consideration will, as of the effective time, be canceled for no consideration;
 
•
each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be
canceled and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common
stock for which such unvested Company Option has not then been exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the merger
consideration over the per share exercise price of such unvested Company Option, which cash amount will continue to vest on
substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the replaced Company Option, subject to the holder’s continued employment
with Parent and its affiliates (including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries), except that any unvested Company Option with a
per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will, as of the effective time, be canceled for no
consideration;

each Company RSU that is unexpired, unsettled and vested (including any Company RSU that vests automatically solely as a result of
the merger) or that is deemed to be vested as described in the following sentence, in each case, outstanding as of immediately prior to
the effective time, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the number of
shares of Company common stock subject to such vested Company RSU or deemed vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to
the effective time, multiplied by the merger consideration. A percentage of each unvested Company RSU that was granted on or prior to
December 11, 2022, is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time and would have vested on or prior to January 31, 2024
(such Company RSU, a “Near-Term Company RSU”) will be accelerated and deemed vested as of immediately prior to the effective time.
The percentage of each Near-Term Company RSU that will be accelerated and deemed vested will be based on a ratio of $65 million to
the total value of all shares of Company common stock underlying each Near-Term Company RSU , multiplied by the merger
consideration. Based on the total value of all Near-Term Company RSUs outstanding as of January 19, 2023 (the latest practicable date
before the filing of this proxy statement) and assuming that no Near-Term Company RSUs vest or are forfeited following January 19,
2023, the percentage of each Near-Term Company RSU that would be accelerated and deemed vested is equal to approximately 43%.
The actual percentage of Near-Term Company RSUs that are accelerated and deemed vested will not be known until the closing of the
merger and will be based on the actual number of Near-Term Company RSUs outstanding at such time. Once the percentage described
above has been calculated, it will be applied pro rata to each Near-Term Company RSU on each regularly scheduled vesting date
between the closing date and January 31, 2024;

Prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, but not after, the Board or any committee thereof may, in response to a bona fide written
takeover proposal not solicited in knowing and material breach of the non-solicitation obligations summarized in this section of this proxy statement,
make an adverse recommendation change or cause the Company to enter into a Company acquisition agreement with respect to a takeover proposal

good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such takeover proposal constitutes a superior proposal.

recommendation change unless (1) the Company has given Parent at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice will specify the identity of the party making such superior proposal, the material terms thereof and, if available, copies of any written
agreements and other documents relating thereto provided to the Company or its representatives), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and the other agreements contemplated therein that would
cause such superior proposal to no longer constitute a superior proposal and (3) following the end of such notice period the Board of or any
committee thereof will have considered in good faith such binding offer, and will have determined that the superior proposal would continue to
constitute a superior proposal if the revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect (it being understood that in the event of any
change to the financial terms or any other material terms of such superior proposal, the foregoing will again apply with respect to each such revision
(but the four business day period will instead be two business days)).
Prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, but not after, the Board or any committee thereof may make an adverse recommendation
change in response to an intervening event if the Board or any committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided that the Board or any committee thereof will not, and will cause the Company not to, take any such action unless (1) the Company has
given Parent at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice will include a reasonably detailed
description of such intervening event), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent
during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the
terms of the merger agreement and the other agreements contemplated therein such that failure to make such adverse recommendation change would
no longer reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciaries under applicable law and (3) following the end of such notice
period, the Board or any committee thereof will have considered in good faith such binding offer, and will have determined that failure to make such
adverse recommendation change would continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
law if the revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect (it being understood that in the event of any change to the financial or
any other material facts of such intervening event, the foregoing will again apply with respect to each such revision (but the four business day
period will instead be two business days)).

the Company pursuant to which such person or group (or the stockholders of any person) would acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or

by the Board or any committee thereof) or 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding equity securities of the
Company or of the surviving entity in a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving the Company or
the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity, in each case, other than the transactions contemplated

any combination of the foregoing.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means any bona fide written takeover proposal made by any person or group (other than
Parent or any of its affiliates) that the Board or any committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) (1) would be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company’s stockholders than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and (2) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all
legal, regulatory, financial, timing, financing, due diligence, antitrust and other aspects of such proposal and of the merger agreement; provided that
for purposes of the definition of “superior proposal”, the references to “20%” in the definition of takeover proposal will be deemed to be references
to “75%”.

to or reasonably foreseeable by the Board on the date of the merger agreement (or if known by the Board, the material consequences of which were
not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of the date of the merger agreement) and becomes known to the Board prior to the receipt of

transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, take all actions necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by the merger agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of such anti-takeover laws on such
transactions.
Each of the parties also agreed (1) to make (a) an appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which will request the early termination of any waiting period applicable to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement under the HSR Act) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the merger agreement, and in
any event within ten calendar days following the date of the merger agreement and (b) the appropriate filings under other required antitrust laws as

expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and obtain any consent, clearance or approval required under any other applicable antitrust

Commission Act or any other applicable antitrust law raised by any governmental authority, in order to prevent the entry of, or to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned, any restraint that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. Nothing in the merger agreement requires any party to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations
unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned on the closing.
Neither Parent nor the Company will commit to or agree with any governmental authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act or any other antitrust laws or enter into a timing agreement with any governmental authority, or withdraw its initial filing pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other antitrust law, as the case may be, and refile any of them, without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent not

temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay or prevent the closing.

The merger agreement provides that each of Parent and Merger Sub will use reasonable efforts to take (and to use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its affiliates to take) all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the financing contemplated by
the commitment letters in amounts at least equal to an amount adequate to provide Parent and Merger Sub with cash proceeds on the closing date
sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations on the closing date under the merger agreement and the commitment
letters, including the payment of the merger consideration on the closing date and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent or Merger Sub or
Parent’s other affiliates, and for any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of the Company and/or its subsidiaries contemplated
by, or required in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or commitment letters (the “financing amounts”). Parent
and Merger Sub will also use reasonable best efforts to take all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the proceeds of the equity financing and debt financing (together, the “financing”) on the terms and subject only to the conditions described
in the applicable commitment letter on a timely basis, taking into account the anticipated closing date, including by:
 
•
maintaining in effect the commitment letters;
 
•
negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the financing (“definitive agreements”) consistent with the terms
and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions contained in any related fee letter); and

•
satisfying, on a timely basis, all conditions in the commitment letters and the definitive agreements that are within its control.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub will also use its reasonable best efforts to comply with its respective obligations, and enforce its rights, under each
commitment letter. In the event that all conditions contained in the applicable commitment letter or the definitive agreements (other than the
consummation of the merger and those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at closing) have been satisfied, each of Parent
and Merger Sub will cause the debt financing sources and/or the Thoma Bravo Fund, as applicable, to fund the financing.
Parent and Merger Sub may not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (1) permit any amendment or modification to, or consent to any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the commitment letters or the definitive agreements if such amendment, modification or waiver (a) imposes
new or additional conditions or other contingencies or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions or other contingencies, in each
case, to the consummation or receipt of all or any portion of the financing, (b) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the debt financing
contemplated in the debt commitment letter (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or the original issue discount) or the aggregate
amount of the equity financing contemplated in the equity commitment letter below the financing amounts, (c) would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against other parties to the commitment letters or the
definitive agreements as so amended, modified or waived, relative to the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the commitment letters as in effect on the date of the merger agreement, (d) would reasonably be expected to make the timely funding of the
financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the financing on the closing date less likely to occur or (e) would otherwise reasonably be
expected to materially prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
or (2) terminate the commitment letters or any material definitive agreement; provided that, however, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger
Sub may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify the debt commitment letter as expressly contemplated thereby as of the date of the merger
agreement solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had not executed the debt
commitment letter as of the date of the merger agreement but only to the extent doing so would not have the effects described in clauses (1)(a) – (e)
above.
In the event that any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason, Parent will (1) promptly notify the Company of
such unavailability and the reason and (2) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and promptly obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount
sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the financing, to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
and to pay the financing amounts) from alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent or
Merger Sub than those contained in the debt commitment letter (provided that no new debt commitment letter will contain any terms or conditions
that would have been prohibited if the same had been effected through an amendment or modification of the debt commitment letter (except with the
prior written consent of the Company)) (the “alternate debt financing”), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to such
alternate debt financing (together with any related fee letter, the “new debt commitment letter”), which will replace the existing debt commitment
letter, a true and complete copy of which will be provided by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, promptly and in any event within 24 hours after
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, obtains it; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub will not be required to obtain
alternate debt financing that would require Parent or Merger Sub to pay fees or other amounts that, taken as a whole, exceed the aggregate fees and
other amounts contemplated to be paid under the debt commitment letter (including after giving effect to any “flex provisions” in the debt
commitment letter) and with terms that are materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub than those set forth in the debt
commitment letter.
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, will provide the Company with prompt written notice of any actual or threatened breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the commitment letters or any definitive agreement with respect to which Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, is aware,
and a copy of any written notice

Each of Parent and Merger Sub will, upon written request from the Company, keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status
of its efforts to consummate the financing.
Compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with the provisions described in this section of this proxy statement will not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of
its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement whether or not the financing is available, and each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledged and agreed that its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement are not conditioned upon or contingent on the availability or consummation of the
debt financing, the availability of any alternate debt financing or receipt of the proceeds therefrom.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company has agreed that prior to the closing, it will use its reasonable best efforts, and cause its subsidiaries
and its and their representatives to use reasonable best efforts, to provide Merger Sub (at Merger Sub’s cost and expense) with customary
cooperation in connection with the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter.

The merger agreement provides that for a period of six years from and after the effective time, the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under (1) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company and its subsidiaries in effect
as of the date of the merger agreement with respect to exculpation from liability, indemnification and advancement and reimbursement of expenses
and (2) any and all indemnification agreements set forth in the confidential disclosure schedules to the merger agreement between the Company or

For a period of six years from and after the effective time, Parent will, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to, (1) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each current and former director or officer of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries (and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time) and each
individual who serves or served at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a representative of another person (including any

expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or

served at the request of the Company or such subsidiary as a representative of another person (including any employee benefit plan) or (b) acts or

in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or relating to the enforcement of the corresponding provision of the
merger agreement or any other indemnification, advancement or reimbursement right of any indemnitee) and (2) assume (in the case of the surviving
corporation, in the merger without any further action) all obligations of the Company and such subsidiaries to the indemnitees in respect of

effective time as provided in the Company’s certificate of incorporation

Parent, for a period of six years from and after the effective time, will cause, unless otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the surviving corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the indemnitees with respect to exculpation from liability,
indemnification and advancement and reimbursement of expenses of directors or officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of the
merger agreement in the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the indemnitees. In addition, from and after the effective time, Parent will, and will
cause the surviving corporation to, in accordance with the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, pay, promptly after receipt by Parent
of a written request by an indemnitee, all costs and expenses of such Indemnitee in connection with matters for which such indemnitee is eligible to
be indemnified in advance of the final disposition of such matter (including any action in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations), subject to receipt of an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under the merger agreement.
Neither Parent nor the surviving corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions (each, a “claim”), for which indemnification could be sought by an indemnitee pursuant to this
provision, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such indemnitee from all liability arising out of such
claim or such indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the surviving corporation and the
indemnitees will cooperate in the defense of any claim and agree to provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish
or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may
be reasonably requested in connection therewith.
For the six-year period commencing immediately after the effective time, the surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving
corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the effective time with respect to those individuals who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the effective time become) covered
by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less
favorable in the aggregate to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date of the merger agreement (or Parent may substitute
therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same aggregate coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
effective time, including a “tail” policy). The Company may (or if requested by Parent, the Company will use reasonably best efforts to), in
consultation with Parent, purchase a six-year prepaid “tail policy” on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits in the
aggregate as the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the effective time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided that,
the cost of any such “tail policy” will not exceed 300% of the Company’s most recent annual premium for its directors’ and officers’ insurance policy
(and if the cost would exceed such limit, the surviving corporation will obtain the maximum amount of coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such limit). If such prepaid “tail policy” has been obtained by the Company, it will be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant
to the foregoing and the surviving corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for
its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.
The obligations of Parent and the surviving corporation with respect to indemnification under the merger agreement will not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any indemnitee to whom such provisions apply unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable law or (y) the affected indemnifiable party will have consented in writing to such termination or modification. In

terms of such plan, with bonuses calculated based on at least 50% of target levels of performance, subject to the Continuing Employee remaining
employed through December 31, 2023. Parent will honor, in accordance with their terms, all of the Company’s compensation and benefit plans,

The SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and
annual reports with respect to two or more Company stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to
those Company stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding”, potentially means extra convenience for Company
stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Brokers with account holders who are Company stockholders may be “householding” proxy materials. A single proxy statement will be delivered to
multiple Company stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected Company stockholders. If you
have received notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address, such “householding” will continue until
you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to
receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker and write or call us at the following address or phone number: Coupa Software

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
The Merger 
Section 1.01 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger. The Company, as the
surviving corporation in the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Surviving Corporation”.
Section 1.02 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place electronically by exchange of Closing deliverables at 8:00
a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law) of those conditions at such time), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in
writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is herein referred to as the “Closing Date”.
Section 1.03 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the “Certificate of Merger”). The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger is filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Secretary of State”) or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such later time as is agreed to by the
parties hereto prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is
herein referred to as the “Effective Time”).
Section 1.04 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the applicable
provisions, including Section 259, of the DGCL.
Section 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of
the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
Parent and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law (and subject to Section 5.06). The parties hereto shall take all necessary actions so that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the
Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be in the form of the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Corporation) and, as so amended and
restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to Section 5.06).
Section 1.06 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.
(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

Table of Contents
(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.
ARTICLE II
Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates; Equity-Based Awards 
Section 2.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any of the outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (“Company
Common Stock”) or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:
(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
(b) Cancelation or Conversion of Certain Shares. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares
of Company Common Stock held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, if any, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall be, at
the election of Parent, either (i) converted into shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation or (ii) canceled.
(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than (i) Appraisal
Shares to be treated in accordance with Section 2.07 and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted in accordance with Section
2.01(b)) shall be canceled and converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $81.00 per
share, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, on such cancelation and conversion, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) or of any non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form
(each, a “Book-Entry Share”) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor on surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.02(b). 
Section 2.02 Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares.
(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith, (ii) enter into
an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
“Payment Fund”). Pending its disbursement in accordance with this Section 2.02, the Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent as necessary to ensure that the
Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments of Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Article II, which such additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. No investment losses resulting from investment of the funds
 
A-3
Table of Contents
deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided herein.
(b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than five Business Days thereafter), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock
(other than the Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass only on surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary provisions (including
customary provisions with respect to Book-Entry Shares) as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 2.01(c). On surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for cancelation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with such letter’s instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (A) the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
To facilitate the payment of the Merger Consideration to the registered holders of Book-Entry Shares, the Company may (and at the request of the
Company, Parent shall use commercially reasonably efforts to) cause the Paying Agent to collect letters of transmittal in advance of the Closing (it being
understood that such letters of transmittal shall be contingent on, and shall be effective on, the occurrence of the Effective Time). Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.
(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company
Common Stock on the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, on the making of an affidavit (in
customary form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this Article II.
 
A-4
Table of Contents
(e) Termination of Payment Fund. At any time following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that has not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (as general unsecured creditors thereof) for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time that would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(g) Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration, and any other amounts payable pursuant to Article II of this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), or under any provision of state, local or non-
U.S. Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
Section 2.03 Company Equity Awards. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof administering the Company Equity Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required or advisable to provide
that:
(a) each Vested Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled, with the
holder thereof becoming entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment, without
interest, equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Vested Company Option has not then been exercised multiplied by
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Vested Company Option; provided that any Vested Company
Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled for no
consideration;
(b) each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a Vested
Company Option (each an “Unvested Company Option”) shall be cancelled and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Unvested Company Option has not then been exercised multiplied by (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Unvested Company Option (the “Cash Replacement Option
Amounts”); which Cash Replacement Option Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option
for which such Cash Replacement Option Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms; provided that any Unvested Company
Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled for no
consideration. All Cash Replacement Option Amounts will have substantially the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting and,
notwithstanding the prior sentence, accelerated vesting) as applied to the award of Unvested Company Options for which they were exchanged, except
for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Transactions or for such other immaterial administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and
good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement Option Amounts. At least five Business Days
prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
 
A-5
Table of Contents
schedule of all Unvested Company Options, the recipients thereof and the applicable vesting schedule with respect thereto;
(c) each Vested Company RSU and each Deemed Vested Company RSU (as defined on Section 2.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive
solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment, without interest, equal to (i) the number of shares of

in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment, without interest, equal to (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (with such number of shares determined by deeming
the applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of target performance and actual performance as determined in accordance with terms of
the applicable award agreement) multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 2.03(e) shall not
apply to the Company PSUs set forth on Section 2.03(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
Section 2.04 Payments with Respect to Company Equity Awards and Termination of Company Equity Plans. Promptly after the Effective

shall pay the amounts due to the holders of vested (or deemed vested pursuant to Section 2.03) Company Equity Awards pursuant to Section 2.03, less
any required withholding pursuant to Section 2.02(g); provided that in the case of any such amounts that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation
under Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable
agreement, plan or arrangement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. The Surviving Corporation shall pay any portion of

A-24

any “flex” provision. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that (i) it or Merger Sub will be unable to satisfy on a

Financing to be provided under the Commitment Letters would not be available to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior to the Closing Date. There are no

the Debt Financing Sources party thereto, enforceable against such Debt Financing Sources in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception, and the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that (with or
without notice, lapse of time or both) could constitute a default, breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent, Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter or would otherwise reasonably be expected to result in any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Parent has paid, or caused to be paid, in full any and all commitment fees or other
fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay, or cause to be paid, in

Commitment Letter as expressly contemplated thereby as of the date hereof). As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no Knowledge of (A) any fact,
occurrence, circumstance or condition that would reasonably be expected to cause the Debt Commitment Letter to terminate or be withdrawn, repudiated
or rescinded or to be or become ineffective or (B) any fact, occurrence, circumstance or condition that would reasonably be expected to prevent any Debt
Financing Source from funding the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter or cause any other potential impediment to the funding of any of
the commitments of the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing.

enforceable against the Equity Investor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and the Equity Commitment Letter

period, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have considered in good faith such binding offer, and shall have determined

duties under applicable Law if the revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect (it being understood that in the event of any change
to the financial or any other material facts of such Intervening Event, this proviso shall again apply with respect to each such revision (but the four

of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable
Law or if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of
the Board of Directors of the Company to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their duties to the Company’s
stockholders under applicable Law, it being understood that (x) any such statement or disclosure made by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a
committee thereof) pursuant to this Section 5.02(g) must be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) and the rights of Parent under this Section 5.02 and (y)
nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) to effect a Adverse

Section 5.03 Efforts.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance
is expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious

manner reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,

submissions of information, applications and other documents, approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations
relating to Antitrust Laws, which are exclusively dealt with in Sections 5.03(c) and (d) below.
(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all
actions necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would
cause the applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
lawfully minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.
(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees: (1) to make (A) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the Transactions (which shall request the early termination of any waiting period applicable to the Transactions under the HSR Act) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event within ten calendar days following the date of this Agreement
and (B) the appropriate filings under the Other Required Antitrust Laws as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, (2) to

prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the Transactions. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any party to take or agree to take any action
with respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned on the Closing. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other

which case such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by

to the failure of a condition precedent set forth in Section 6.02(b) or a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i) unless such failure
is the result of a knowing and intentional breach by the Company of any provision of Section 5.03(f).

and regulations of any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for any matters referred to in, and made in
compliance with, Section 5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions following execution of

Section 5.05 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to applicable Law and any applicable Judgment, between the date of this

A-38
Table of Contents
other Transactions, including with respect to the structuring, financing or consummation thereof, or integration planning relating thereto, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent and Parent’s Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than any of the foregoing that relate to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, or, except as expressly provided in Section 5.02, to any Takeover Proposal or any other transactions
potentially competing with or alternative to the Transactions or proposals from other parties relating to any competing or alternative transactions) and the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent and Parent’s Representatives such information concerning its business,
personnel, assets, liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request (other than, in each case, any information that is reasonably pertinent to
any adverse Action between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand); provided that Parent and
its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; provided further that the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so is reasonably likely to (i) violate applicable Law or an applicable Judgment, (ii) result in the disclosure of trade
secrets or competitively sensitive information to third parties, (iii) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, attorney work product
protection or other legal privilege or (iv) jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries in light of COVID-19 (taking
into account any COVID-19 Measure). In any such event, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the
applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable Law or Judgment, result in such adverse disclosure of trade secrets or competitively
sensitive information or risk waiver of such privilege or protection, including entering into a joint defense agreement, common interest agreement or other
similar arrangement. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 5.05 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated
by the Company. Until the Effective Time, all information provided between the parties hereto and their Representatives shall be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of October 28, 2022, by and between the Company and the Thoma Bravo, L.P. (the “Confidentiality Agreement”)
and shall be deemed to be “Confidential Information” thereunder.
Section 5.06 Indemnification and Insurance.
(a) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this
Agreement with respect to exculpation from liability, indemnification and advancement and reimbursement of expenses and (ii) any and all indemnification
agreements set forth on Section 5.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
present or former directors or officers in effect as of the date of this Agreement. For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (A) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless each current and former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and any person who becomes a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) and each individual who serves or served at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a Representative of another Person (including any employee benefit plan) (each, an “Indemnitee” and, collectively, the “Indemnitees”)
with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts incurred by such Indemnitee in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (1) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or serves or has served at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a Representative of another
Person (including any employee benefit plan) or (2) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee’s capacity as a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary as a Representative of
 
A-39
Table of Contents
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under clause (1) or (2), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any
Action relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification, advancement or
reimbursement right of any Indemnitee) and (B) assume (in the case of the Surviving Corporation, in the Merger without any further action) all obligations
of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company Charter Documents and the organizational
documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, for a period of six years from and after
the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain
provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to exculpation from liability, indemnification and advancement and reimbursement of
expenses of directors or officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In
addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, in accordance with the Company Charter
Documents, pay, promptly after receipt by Parent of a written request by an Indemnitee, all costs and expenses of such Indemnitee in connection with
matters for which such Indemnitee is eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.06(a) in advance of the final disposition of such matter
(including any Action in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 5.06), subject to receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification under this Section 5.06(a).
(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or
actual litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.06 (each, a “Claim”) for which indemnification could
be sought by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all
liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.
(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective Time become)
covered by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less
favorable in the aggregate to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor
policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same aggregate coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including a “tail” policy). The Company may (or if requested by Parent, the Company shall use reasonably best efforts to), in consultation with Parent,
purchase a six-year prepaid “tail policy” on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits in the aggregate as the current
policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to
the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions; provided that, the cost of any such “tail policy” shall not exceed 300% of the Company’s
most recent annual premium for its directors’ and officers’ insurance policy (and if the cost would exceed such limit, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain the maximum amount of coverage available for a cost not exceeding such limit). If such prepaid “tail policy” has been obtained by the Company, it
shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.06(c) and the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.
(d) The provisions of this Section 5.06 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
 
A-40
Table of Contents
for, any other rights to indemnification, reimbursement or contribution that any such individual may have under the Company Charter Documents, by
contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.06 shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.06 applies unless (i) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.06 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.06).
(e) In the event that (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, or (ii) Parent or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.06.
(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.06 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.
(g) Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under this Section 5.06 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
years from the Effective Time; provided that if any Claim (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against an Indemnitee on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.06 shall continue in effect until the full and final resolution of such
Claim.
Section 5.07 Financing.
(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its Affiliates have no responsibility for any financing
Parent or Merger Sub may raise in connection with the Transactions. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable efforts to take (and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates to take) all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters in amounts at least equal to the Financing Amounts. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions described in the applicable Commitment Letter on a
timely basis, taking into account the anticipated Closing Date, including by (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters (ii) negotiating and entering
into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing (the “Definitive Agreements”) consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein
(including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions contained in any related fee letter) and (iii) satisfying, on a timely basis, all conditions in the Commitment
Letters and the Definitive Agreements that are within its control. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with its
respective obligations, and enforce its rights, under each Commitment Letter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that all
conditions contained in the applicable Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements (other than the consummation of the Merger and those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at Closing) have been satisfied, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Debt
Financing Sources and/or the Equity Investor, as applicable, to fund the Financing.
(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not without the prior written consent of the Company: (i) permit any amendment or modification to,
or consent to any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements if such amendment, modification or
waiver (A) imposes new or additional conditions or other contingencies or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions or other
contingencies, in each case, to the consummation or receipt of all or any portion of the Financing, (B) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Debt
Financing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter
 
A-41
Table of Contents
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or the original issue discount) or the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing contemplated in the
Equity Commitment Letter below the Financing Amounts, (C) would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, modified or
waived, relative to the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, (D) would reasonably be expected to make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing on the Closing Date less likely to occur or (E) would otherwise reasonably be expected to materially prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) terminate the Commitment Letters or any material
Definitive Agreement; provided that, however, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify the
Debt Commitment Letter as expressly contemplated thereby as of the date hereof solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof but only to the extent doing so would not
have the effects described in clauses (i)(A) – (E) above. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment, modification or waiver. Any reference in this Agreement to “Equity Financing” shall include the financing contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter as amended or modified in express compliance with this Section 5.07(b), and “Equity Commitment Letter” shall include such document
as amended or modified in express compliance with this Section 5.07(b). Any reference in this Agreement to “Debt Financing” shall include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as amended or modified in express compliance with this Section 5.07(b), and “Debt Commitment Letter”
shall include such document as amended or modified in express compliance with this Section 5.07(b).
(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall, (i) promptly
notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and promptly obtain alternative debt
financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Financing, to consummate the Transactions and to pay the
Financing Amounts) from alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent or Merger Sub than those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (provided that no New Debt Commitment Letter shall contain any terms or conditions that would have been
prohibited pursuant to Section 5.07(b) if the same had been effected through an amendment or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter (except with
the prior written consent of the Company)) (the “Alternate Debt Financing”), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to such
Alternate Debt Financing (together with any related fee letter, the “New Debt Commitment Letter”) (it being understood and agreed that any fee letter
delivered in connection with any New Debt Commitment Letter may be redacted in the same manner as set forth in the definition of “Debt Commitment
Letter” as in effect on the date hereof), which shall replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter, a true and complete copy of which shall be provided by
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, promptly and in any event within 24 hours after Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, obtains it; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to obtain Alternate Debt Financing that would require Parent or Merger Sub
to pay fees or other amounts that, taken as a whole, exceed the aggregate fees and other amounts contemplated to be paid under the Debt Commitment
Letter (including after giving effect to any “flex provisions” in the Debt Commitment Letter) and with terms that are materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (A)
any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt Financing” shall mean, with respect to the Debt Financing, the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (as the meaning of such term is modified pursuant to clause (B) below) and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt
Commitment Letter” shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by the New Debt Commitment Letter at the time
in question and the New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect. Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall provide the Company with prompt
written notice of any actual or threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement
with respect to which Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, is aware, and a copy of any written notice or other written communication from any
 
A-42
Table of Contents
Debt Financing Source, the Equity Investor or other financing source with respect to any actual or threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to the Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, upon written request
from the Company, keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing. The foregoing
notwithstanding, compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this Section 5.07 shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations to consummate the
Transactions whether or not the Financing is available, and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate
the Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein are not conditioned upon or contingent on the availability or consummation
of the Debt Financing, the availability of any Alternate Debt Financing or receipt of the proceeds therefrom.
Section 5.08 Financing Cooperation.
(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to use reasonable best efforts, to provide customary cooperation for debt financings similar to the Debt Financing, to the extent
reasonably requested by Merger Sub in writing and at Merger Sub’s sole expense, in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (provided
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), including using
commercially reasonable efforts to:
(i) participate in a reasonable number of meetings (which may be virtual) and presentations, to the extent customary for financings of a type
similar to the Debt Financing and at reasonable times and with reasonable advance notice to the Company (but limited in the case of the Debt
Financing Sources to not more than one virtual meeting with the Debt Financing Sources);
(ii) to the extent required by the Debt Financing, using commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging and perfection of collateral of
the Company, effective no earlier than the Closing;
(iii) provide at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date all documentation and other information required by bank regulatory
authorities under applicable “know-your-customer”, anti-money laundering rules and regulations and beneficial ownership rules and regulations,
including the USA PATRIOT Act and 31 C.F.R. §1010.230, relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as reasonably requested
by Parent at least nine Business Days prior to the Closing Date;
(iv) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, providing reasonable and customary assistance to Merger Sub in obtaining private
corporate and facilities credit ratings with respect to the Debt Financing;
(v) assist in the preparation of, and executing and delivering at Closing, Definitive Agreements, including schedules, guarantee and collateral
documents and customary closing certificates to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter (including a solvency certificate in the form set
forth on Annex I to Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter);
(vi) assisting in the taking of all corporate and other similar actions, subject to and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date; it being understood that (A) no such corporate or
other action will take effect prior to the Closing and (B) any such corporate or other action will only be required of the directors, members, partners,
managers or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who retain their respective positions as of the Closing; and
(vii) deliver such readily available financial information regarding the Company as is reasonably requested by Merger Sub in connection with
the Debt Financing, and solely to the extent such information is of the type customarily provided by a borrower in connection with similar debt
financings to the Debt Financing and can be prepared by the Company without unreasonable effort or undue burden (it being understood and
agreed that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be required to provide any Excluded Information),
 
A-43
Table of Contents
it being understood and agreed that the Company shall have satisfied the obligations set forth in Section 5.08(a)(i) through Section 5.08(a)(vii) if
the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such obligations whether or not any applicable deliverables are
actually obtained or provided.
(b) The foregoing notwithstanding, none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking of any
action pursuant to this Section 5.08 that would (i) require the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives (collectively,
the “Company Cooperation Parties”) to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing or enter into, execute or
deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or
agreement, in each case that are not conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing (other than the execution of customary authorization letters in
connection with the obligations set forth above; provided that in no event shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be required to assume any expense in
connection with the execution of such documents), (ii) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by any Company
Cooperation Party or require any Company Cooperation Party to make a representation, warranty or certification that, in good faith determination of such
Person, is not true, (iii) require any Company Cooperation Party to (A) pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or
obligation in connection with the Debt Financing that is not reimbursed by Parent and/or Merger Sub at the Closing or (B) require any Company
Cooperation Party to enter into or approve any Debt Financing that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing or have any obligation of any
Company Cooperation Party under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument be effective until the Closing or (iv) cause any director, officer,
employee or stockholder of the Company Cooperation Parties to incur any personal liability, (v) conflict with or violate the organizational documents of

each person who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who remains so employed immediately
following the Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Employee”) that, in each case, are no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the applicable Company Plan listed on Section 5.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter and (iii) other employee benefit plans and arrangements (not including defined benefit pension, retiree or post-employment health or welfare,

in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off, defined contribution retirement and severance plans), but not including those that
provide Excluded Benefits, each Continuing Employee’s service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level
of benefits, and vesting to the same extent and for the same purpose as such service was recognized and credited to such Continuing Employee by the
Company and its Subsidiaries under the corresponding Company Plan; provided that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits or compensation for the same period of service.
(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.12(a), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary to take commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any

maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary to take commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be recognized the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by and credited to each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) under the
applicable Company Plan providing group health benefits during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such
year’s deductible and co-payment limitations under the corresponding group health benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and

of “change in control” (or similar phrase) will occur at the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
Subsidiary, shall honor all of the Company Plans set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect
on the date of this Agreement or, solely to the extent amended not in violation of this Agreement after the date of this Agreement, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating
any such Company Plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.
(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) or any
other Affiliate to retain the employment of any particular employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, including any
Continuing Employee, or prohibit the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof from amending or terminating any Company
Plan in accordance with its terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law. The provisions of this Section 5.12 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.12 is intended to, or shall, create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person (including
any Continuing Employee), provide any such Person any right to enforce the provisions hereof, or constitute the establishment, adoption, amendment or
termination of any Company Plan or any other employee benefit or compensation plan.
Section 5.13 Transaction Litigation. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, of any stockholder demands, litigations, arbitrations or other similar claims, actions, suits or proceedings (including derivative
claims) commenced against it, its Subsidiaries and/or its or its Subsidiaries’ respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions (collectively, “Transaction Litigation”) of which Parent or the Company, as applicable, obtains Knowledge and shall keep the other party
reasonably informed regarding any Transaction Litigation. Each of the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the other in the defense or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and shall give the other party the opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense and settlement of such
Transaction Litigation and to participate (at the other party’s expense) in (but not control) the defense and settlement of such Transaction Litigation. Prior
to the Effective Time, other than with respect to any Transaction Litigation where the parties are adverse to each other or in the context of any
Transaction Litigation related to or arising out of a Takeover Proposal, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall settle or offer to settle any
Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.13, in the event of any
conflict with any other covenant or agreement contained in Section 5.03 that expressly addresses the subject matter of this Section 5.13, Section 5.03 shall
govern and control.

the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply Parent with copies of all written

prior written consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (including any adjournment, recess or postponement thereof, the “Company Stockholders’ Meeting”) for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, and shall commence mailing the definitive Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date. Subject to Section 5.02, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, adjourn, recess,

Proxy Statement that the Company has determined is reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law and for such supplement or amendment to be
disseminated and reviewed by the stockholders of the Company in advance of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, (ii) to the extent required by a court
of competent jurisdiction in connection with any Actions in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, (iii) if as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders’ Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (it being
understood that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than three times, and each such time, no more than
by ten Business Days on any single occasion, pursuant to this clause (iii) without Parent’s prior written consent) or (iv) to solicit additional proxies for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (it being understood that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting by more than three times, and each such time, no more than by ten Business Days on any single occasion, pursuant to this clause

Agreement and the Merger to its stockholders at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting even if the Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee
thereof) has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change.

prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (2) within twelve months after the date this Agreement is terminated, the Company consummates,
or enters into a definitive agreement providing for and later consummates, a Takeover Proposal, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, the
Company Termination Fee to Parent or its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds (to the wire instructions for such payment provided by
Parent prior to the payment thereof) within two Business Days after the consummation of such Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Section
7.03(a)(ii), the references to “20%” in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “50%”.

A-52
Table of Contents
any additional amounts payable pursuant to the last two sentences of Section 7.03(c)) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Equity Investor and their respective Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, equityholders, controlling persons, financing sources, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or the Equity
Investor), partners, managers, members, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Equity Investor (collectively, the
“Parent Related Parties”) against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and on payment of such amount none of the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.
(b) Parent Termination Fee.
(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i) or Section 7.01(d)(iii) or (B) by the
Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) and, in each case, at the time of such termination, the Company could have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i) or Section 7.01(d)(iii), then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Parent Termination Fee to the
Company or its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds (to the wire instructions for such payment provided by the Company prior to the
payment thereof) (1) in the case of any such termination by Parent, concurrently with and as a condition to the termination by Parent and (2) in the
case of any such termination by the Company, within two Business Days after such termination.
(ii) In no event shall Parent be required to pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
(iii) In the event the Parent Termination Fee is paid to the Company in circumstances under which such fee is payable pursuant to this
Section 7.03(b), payment of the Parent Termination Fee (plus, if applicable, any additional amounts payable pursuant to the last two sentences of
Section 7.03(c)) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and on
payment of such amount none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions.
(c) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 7.03 are an integral part of the
Transactions, (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and (iii) without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and when required to be paid
pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving
such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger. Further, if the Company or Parent fails to
promptly pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, when due pursuant to this Section 7.03, such fee shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such fee becomes past due, at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in
effect on the date such fee becomes past due. In addition, if (i) the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due, the Company shall
also pay to Parent all of Parent’s costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with efforts to collect the
Company Termination Fee and (ii) if Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, Parent shall also pay to the Company all of the
Company’s costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with efforts to collect the Parent Termination Fee.

(d) In connection with any loss suffered by any Parent Related Party as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for
a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, other than in the circumstances in which Parent is entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee
in accordance with Section 7.03(a) (in which case Section 7.03(a)(iv) shall apply), Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and the Parent Related Parties, that the
sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company and the Company Related Parties, if any, shall
be limited to an amount not to exceed the Company Termination Fee, and in no event shall Parent or any Parent Related Party seek or be entitled to
recover from the Company or any Company Related Parties, and Parent on behalf of itself and the Parent Related Parties hereby irrevocably waives and
relinquishes any right to seek or recover, any monetary damages in excess of such amount.
(e) In no event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person
acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Parent
Termination Fee (plus, if applicable, any additional amounts payable pursuant to the last two sentences of Section 7.03(c)) against the Parent Related
Parties, and, in no event will the Company be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or
punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Termination Fee (plus, if applicable, any additional amounts payable pursuant to the last two sentences of
Section 7.03(c)) against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Guarantee or the Transactions (including, any breach by the Equity Investor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure; provided that, without
limiting the provisions of Section 8.14 hereof, the foregoing shall not preclude any liability of the Debt Financing Sources to Parent or Merger Sub under
the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing, nor limit Parent or Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable
relief from or with respect to any Debt Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. Other than the Equity
Investor’s obligations under the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter and the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement of the parties
thereto and other than the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related
Parties or any other Person other than the Equity Investor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any
Company Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger.

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement, all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based

on any Person other than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process on such party in any Action arising out of or relating to this

the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; provided that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party’s rights to seek any post-
judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.
Section 8.08 Specific Enforcement.
(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the
parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party hereto acknowledges
and agrees that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 8.07(b) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and without that right neither the Company, Parent nor Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.08 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded under the Equity Commitment Letter and
Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger (but not the right of the Company to seek such injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (i) all of the conditions in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 have been,
and continue to be, satisfied or waived at the time the Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.02 (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing
has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions as are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur
and (iv) Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to consummate the Merger by the time the Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to Section
1.02. In no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce specifically Parent’s
 
A-56
Table of Contents
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (or exercise its third party beneficiary rights under the Equity Commitment Letter) if the Debt
Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be entitled to a remedy of specific performance or other equitable remedies against any Debt Financing Source.
(c) The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 8.08, the Company shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 8.08 shall require
the Company to institute any Action (or limit the Company’s right to institute any Action) for an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
under this Section 8.08 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article VII (and receiving the Parent Termination Fee or pursuing
monetary damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Action pursuant to this Section 8.08 or anything set forth in this Section
8.08 restrict or limit the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter; provided that in no event shall the Company be entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the Closing to occur, on the one hand, and the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand.
Section 8.09 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY ACTION OR CONTROVERSY THAT
MAY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, RELATE TO OR ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY ACTION RELATING TO THE DEBT

Members of the Board:
We understand that Coupa Software Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Project CS Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (“Parent”), and Project CS Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), plan to enter into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated as of December 11, 2022, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will
merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the
Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) (other than (i) Appraisal Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) and (ii) shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted in accordance with Section 2.01(b) of the Merger Agreement) shall be canceled and converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $81.00, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). The
terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the “Holders”), is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such Holders.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated December 11, 2022 (the “Draft Merger
Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company.
We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial
projections and operating data of the Company (the “Company Projections”). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and financial
condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity
for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock
for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock
with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly
available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as
we have deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections,
we have been advised by the management of the Company, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of

Directors of the Company, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the
Company Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. We have assumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ
materially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of
the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the
contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we
have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and
products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which will
become payable upon delivery of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has
agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date
hereof, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company, Thoma Bravo, L.P. or Parent pursuant to which
compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and
other financial services to the Company, Thoma Bravo, L.P. or Parent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from
which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short
positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Thoma Bravo, L.P., Parent or certain of their
respective affiliates.
This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the
Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company
Common Stock will trade at any time.
Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of,
the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the
Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger
Agreement by the Holders, and we express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to

any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be received by the Holders
