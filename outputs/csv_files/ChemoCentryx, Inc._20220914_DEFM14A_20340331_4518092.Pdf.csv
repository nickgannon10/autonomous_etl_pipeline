"ChemoCentryx, Inc._20220914_DEFM14A_20340331_4518092.Pdf",QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting (together with any
adjournments or postponements thereof, referred to as the “Special Meeting”), the Merger Agreement (as defined below) and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub (as defined below) will be merged with and into ChemoCentryx (as
defined below), with ChemoCentryx surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen (as defined below) (referred to as the
“Merger”). Please refer to the “Summary” beginning on page 13 of this proxy statement and the more detailed information contained elsewhere
in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents incorporated by reference or referred to in this proxy statement,
which you should read carefully and in their entirety.
Except as otherwise specifically noted in this proxy statement or as context otherwise requires, “ChemoCentryx,” “we,” “our,” “us,” the
“Company” and similar words in this proxy statement refer to ChemoCentryx, Inc. including, in certain cases, our subsidiaries. Throughout this
proxy statement we refer to Amgen Inc. as “Amgen” and Carnation Merger Sub, Inc. as “Merger Sub.” In addition, throughout this proxy
statement we refer to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 3, 2022, as it may be amended from time to time, among Amgen, Merger
Sub and ChemoCentryx, as the “Merger Agreement.”
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On August 3, 2022, ChemoCentryx entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Amgen, with and into ChemoCentryx, with ChemoCentryx surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. The Board of
Directors of ChemoCentryx (referred to as the “Board”) is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of
ChemoCentryx common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
A:
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of ChemoCentryx by Amgen pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement is approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote thereon as of the Record Date (as defined below) and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into ChemoCentryx, with ChemoCentryx surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Amgen. As a result of the Merger, ChemoCentryx common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global
Select Market (referred to as “Nasdaq”). In addition, ChemoCentryx common stock will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (referred to as the “Exchange Act”), and ChemoCentryx will no longer file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (referred to as the “SEC”).
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
Upon consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive $52.00 in cash, without interest (referred to as the “Merger Consideration”),
for each share of ChemoCentryx common stock that you own as of the Effective Time (as defined below), unless you have properly exercised
and not failed to perfect, waived, withdrawn or otherwise lost your right to appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (referred to as the “DGCL”). For example, if you own 100 shares of our common stock as of the Effective Time,
you will receive $5,200.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock (less any applicable withholding taxes). You will not be
entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Amgen as a result of the Merger.

Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the unaffected market price of ChemoCentryx common stock prior to the public
announcement that ChemoCentryx entered into the Merger Agreement? How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price
of ChemoCentryx common stock as of a recent trading date?
A:
The Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 116% over the closing price of ChemoCentryx common stock on Nasdaq of
$24.11 on August 3, 2022, the last trading day before the public announcement that ChemoCentryx entered into the Merger Agreement. On
September 13, 2022, the last practicable day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price of ChemoCentryx common stock on
Nasdaq was $51.37 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for ChemoCentryx common stock.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will take place on October 18, 2022 at the offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, located at 650 Town Center Drive, 20th Floor,
Costa Mesa, CA 92626, at 9:00 a.m., local time.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
To adopt the Merger Agreement (referred to as the “Merger Proposal”);
•
To approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to ChemoCentryx’s
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger (referred to as the “Merger Compensation Proposal”); and
•
To approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (referred to as the
“Adjournment Proposal”).
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Only holders of record of ChemoCentryx common stock as of the close of business on September 13, 2022 (referred to as the “Record Date”)
will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 71,919,705 shares
of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share of ChemoCentryx common stock on that date will entitle its
holder to one vote, in person or by proxy, on all matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote
thereon as of the Record Date is required to approve the Merger Proposal.
The failure to grant a proxy to vote your shares of common stock by submitting a signed proxy card, granting a proxy electronically over the
Internet or by telephone or to vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock on the Merger Proposal will result in a broker non-vote and will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal.

Q:
What factors did the Board consider in deciding to enter into the Merger Agreement and recommending the approval of the Merger
Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?
A:
In reaching its decision to unanimously approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, and to recommend that our stockholders approve the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment
Proposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of the proposed
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, as well as other alternatives. For a more detailed
description of these factors, see “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 48 of this
proxy statement.
Q:
What is a quorum and how many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
A:
A quorum of stockholders is the presence of stockholders holding the minimum number of shares necessary to transact business at the
Special Meeting. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting,
either present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, then under our
amended and restated bylaws, either (i) the holders of voting stock representing a majority of the voting power present at the Special Meeting
in person or represented by proxy, or (ii) the chairperson of the Special Meeting, may each adjourn the meeting, and the meeting may be held
as adjourned without further notice other than an announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken of the hour, date and place
to which the meeting is adjourned and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting.
If you submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or submit a ballot in person at the Special
Meeting (regardless of whether you indicate how you wish to vote), your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock will be counted for purposes
of determining the presence of a quorum. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee
on how to vote your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock will result in a broker non-vote and such shares will not be counted for purposes
of determining the presence of a quorum. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will be counted for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to ChemoCentryx’s
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock present in person or by proxy
at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Merger Compensation Proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote
in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have
any effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as if
you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Compensation Proposal.
Because the vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either ChemoCentryx or Amgen.
Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of ChemoCentryx’s stockholders on the Merger
Compensation Proposal.

Table of Contents
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit
additional proxies?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock present in person or by proxy
at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote
in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the
failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have any effect
on the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as if you voted
“AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Board, after considering the various factors described under “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger”
beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted, and declared
advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) resolved to recommend the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger by ChemoCentryx’s stockholders and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger
Agreement be submitted to a vote of ChemoCentryx’s stockholders.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Merger Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, and the documents we
incorporate by reference and refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you, and then sign, date and
return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically on the Internet
or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting
instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your
proxy card.
Q:
How do I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (referred to as “AST”)), there are four ways to cause your shares to be voted at the Special Meeting:
•
by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card and granting your proxy;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card and granting your proxy; or
•
by completing, dating, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope.
4
Table of Contents
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted “FOR” each of the Merger
Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to grant a proxy to vote your shares of
common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when granting a proxy electronically over the
Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for granting a proxy to vote your shares, if you grant a proxy
electronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you will be
responsible. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to grant a proxy to vote your shares of
common stock.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your broker,
bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your
shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, AST, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
“stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf of
ChemoCentryx.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of such shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock and are considered to hold them in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank,
broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have
the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also
invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the
Special Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
Will my shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting
purposes with shares I hold as the stockholder of record?
A:
No. Because any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder
than any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock you hold as the stockholder of record, any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held in
“street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock you hold as the stockholder of
record. Similarly, if you own shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of
a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held by a corporation or
business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held in an individual retirement
account must be voted under the rules governing the account.
Q:
If I hold my shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in “street name,” will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my shares for me on the
proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting?
A:
Not without your direction. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock on
any “non-routine” proposal if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks,
brokers or other nominees have the
5
Table of Contents
discretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock with respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers
and other nominees therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to instruct them, as applicable, to vote your shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock. Without such instructions, a broker non-vote will result, and your shares will not be voted at the Special
Meeting. A broker non-vote will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Q:
What happens if I do not vote?
A:
The required vote to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and
outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date, not just the shares that are voted at the Special Meeting. If you do not vote in
person or by proxy, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise submitted my vote by proxy?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time by:
•
delivering a written notice of revocation of your proxy to our Corporate Secretary at ChemoCentryx, Inc., Attention: Corporate
Secretary, 835 Industrial Road, Suite 600, San Carlos, CA 94070 prior to 11:59 pm Eastern Time on October 17, 2022, the day preceding
the Special Meeting;
•
signing a new proxy card with a date later than the date of the previously submitted proxy card relating to the same shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock and returning it to us by mail prior to 11:59 pm Eastern Time on October 17, 2022, the day preceding the
Special Meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy by telephone or Internet prior to 11:59 pm Eastern Time on October 17, 2022, the day preceding the Special
Meeting; or
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting in person (simply attending the Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked).
Please note that if you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote
your shares, the above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you should contact your bank,
broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change or revoke your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if
you obtain a valid “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person (referred to as a “proxy”) to vote your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock. This
written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document
used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock is called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated each of
Thomas J. Schall, Ph.D. and Susan M. Kanaya, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to grant a proxy to vote your shares, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies,
will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing
6
Table of Contents
the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST” or to
abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented
by your properly signed proxy will be voted (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal, (ii) “FOR” the Merger Compensation Proposal and (iii) “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A:
Yes. All stockholders of ChemoCentryx as of the Record Date may attend the Special Meeting and vote in person. Stockholders will need to
present proof of ownership of our common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be
admitted to the Special Meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in
the Special Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return the
enclosed proxy or grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or via telephone to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Special
Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at
the Special Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of ChemoCentryx common stock before consummation of the Merger?
A:
If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock before consummation of the Merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the
Merger Consideration in the Merger. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of our common stock through
consummation of the Merger.
The Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the date the Merger is anticipated to be consummated.
Accordingly, if you sell or transfer your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless
special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares
and each of you notifies ChemoCentryx in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock, but you
will have retained your right to vote these shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or grant a proxy via the
Internet or telephone.
Q:
How will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled?
A:
If you hold your shares of common stock in certificated form, you will receive a letter of transmittal shortly after the Merger is consummated
instructing you how to surrender your stock certificates, to an exchange agent to be designated by Amgen in order to receive the Merger
Consideration to which you are entitled. Please do not send in your stock certificates now. If you hold your shares of common stock in book-
entry form but not through the Depository Trust Company (referred to as “DTC”), you will receive instructions regarding delivery of an
“agent’s message” with respect to such book-entry shares. If your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock are held in “street name” by your
broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take
to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

Table of Contents
Q:
I do not know where my stock certificate is. How will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the consummation of the Merger will include the procedures that
you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your
stock certificate. You may also be required to post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be consummated?
A:
Consummation of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date,
the expiration or termination of the required waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (referred to as the “HSR Act”), and certain other conditions.
We currently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the fourth quarter of 2022, assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to the Merger. However, it is possible, including as a result of factors outside the control of ChemoCentryx and Amgen, that the
Merger will be consummated at a later time or not at all.
Q:
What effects will the Merger have on ChemoCentryx?
A:
Our common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, and is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “CCXI.” As a result of the
Merger, ChemoCentryx will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the consummation of the Merger, our common stock will cease trading on and be delisted from Nasdaq and
will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and ChemoCentryx will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Q:
Why am I being asked to vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal?
A:
In accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing you with the opportunity to cast a non-
binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Merger Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Merger
Compensation Proposal is on an advisory basis and will not be binding on ChemoCentryx or Amgen. Further, the underlying compensation
plans and agreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, if the Merger
Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,
regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of ChemoCentryx’s stockholders on the Merger Compensation Proposal.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx common stock
entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date or if the Merger is not
8
Table of Contents
consummated for any other reason, ChemoCentryx stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock pursuant
to the Merger Agreement. Instead, ChemoCentryx will remain a public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on
Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Amgen a termination fee of $119,314,679 upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement as described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee; Certain Expenses” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement.
Q:
Do any directors or executive officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of ChemoCentryx stockholders generally?
A:
In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive
officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of
these potential interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending
that the Merger Agreement be adopted by our stockholders. For a description of the potential interests of our directors and executive officers
in the Merger, see “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of ChemoCentryx in the Merger” beginning on page 62 of
this proxy statement.
Q:
Who will count the votes obtained at the Special Meeting?
A:
The votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
We intend to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days following the
Special Meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to ChemoCentryx stockholders of the exchange of ChemoCentryx common
stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
A:
The exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A “U.S.
Holder” (as defined below under “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 72 of this
proxy statement) generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between
the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of our
common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A “Non-U.S. Holder” (as defined below under “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income
tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the
United States. You should consult your tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of
your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or other tax
laws. A more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under “The Merger—Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement.

Q:
What will the holders of ChemoCentryx equity awards receive in the Merger?
A:
As of the Effective Time, (i) each ChemoCentryx stock option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price of such ChemoCentryx stock option multiplied by (B) the number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock underlying
such stock option; (ii) each ChemoCentryx restricted stock unit (referred to as an “RSU”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that was (A) granted prior to August 3, 2022 or granted after August 3, 2022 and specified in the Disclosure Schedules and/or (B)
granted to a non-employee member of the Board will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock underlying such
RSU; (iii) each RSU that was granted on or after August 3, 2022 (other than to a non-employee member of the Board and subject to certain
exceptions specified in the Disclosure Schedules) and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock
subject to such RSU multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration (referred to as an “Amgen Cash Award”), which will vest and become payable
at the same time as such RSU would have vested and been payable, subject to continued employment; and (iv) each ChemoCentryx restricted
stock award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that was (A) granted prior to August 3, 2022 and/or (B) held by a
non-employee member of the Board will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration.

and the ESPP” beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What will happen to the ChemoCentryx 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan?
A:
The Merger Agreement provides that, except for the offering period under ChemoCentryx’s 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (referred to as
the “ESPP”) that was in effect on August 3, 2022 (referred to as the “Final Offering Period”), no new offering periods under the ESPP will
commence following August 3, 2022, there will be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions or payroll contributions permitted to be
made by the participants under the ESPP during the current offering period, except those made in accordance with payroll deduction elections
that are in effect as of August 3, 2022, and no individuals will commence participation in the ESPP following August 3, 2022. If the Effective
Time occurs during the Final Offering Period, (w) the final exercise date under the ESPP will be such date as ChemoCentryx determines in its
sole discretion (which date must be no later than the date that is five business days prior to the Effective Time), (x) each ESPP participant’s
accumulated contributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in accordance with the terms of
the ESPP as of such final exercise date, (y) the ESPP will terminate effective as of no later than one business day prior to the Closing Date and
(z) as promptly as practicable following the purchase of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in accordance with the preceding clause (x),
ChemoCentryx will return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase. For additional
information regarding the ESPP, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP” beginning on page 79 of this proxy
statement.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for my shares of common stock under the DGCL?
A:
Yes. As a holder of ChemoCentryx common stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger if
you take certain actions and meet certain conditions. Under the
10
Table of Contents
DGCL, stockholders who do not vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their
shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is consummated, but only if they
comply fully with all applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than,
the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration. Any stockholder intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other
things, submit a written demand for appraisal to ChemoCentryx before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement is taken and must
not vote or otherwise submit a proxy to vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Because any proxy that is submitted without an
indication as to how you wish to vote will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal, if you wish to exercise appraisal rights or preserve your right
to do so, any proxy submitted by you must provide instructions to vote “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on the Merger Proposal. Failure to follow
exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of the
DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights we encourage you to seek the advice of your own
legal counsel. See “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, if your shares of common stock are held in more than one brokerage account or are registered differently, you
will receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete, date, sign and return (or grant a proxy to vote via the
Internet or telephone with respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive to ensure that all of your shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock are voted.
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits us to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary
instructions have been received, but only if we provide advance notice and follow certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder
continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial
owners of shares of our common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of our common
stock, you may have already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any
questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement
promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple
copies.

The Special Meeting (page 26)
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of proxies to be voted at a Special Meeting of
ChemoCentryx stockholders to be held on October 18, 2022, at the offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, located at 650 Town Center Drive 20th Floor,
Costa Mesa, CA 92626, at 9:00 a.m., local time.
At the Special Meeting, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on (i) the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Merger
Compensation Proposal and (iii) the Adjournment Proposal.
The Merger Proposal (page 104)
You will be asked to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides, among other
things, that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
13Table of Contents
conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into ChemoCentryx, with ChemoCentryx surviving the Merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Amgen and that, at the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held by ChemoCentryx, Amgen, any subsidiary of ChemoCentryx or of Amgen, or any
stockholder who has properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.
Following the Merger, ChemoCentryx common stock will no longer be publicly listed and traded on Nasdaq, and existing ChemoCentryx
stockholders will cease to have any ownership interest in ChemoCentryx.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum (page 26)
You are entitled to receive notice and to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as of the close of
business on the Record Date for the Special Meeting.
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or by
proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, will constitute a
quorum at the Special Meeting, permitting ChemoCentryx to transact business at the Special Meeting.
Vote Required to Approve the Merger (page 26)
Each share of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at
the Special Meeting.
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the holders of a majority of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date to vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or an abstention
from voting for the Merger Proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
As of the Record Date, there were 71,919,705 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger (page 48)
The Board, after considering various factors more fully described under “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the
Merger” beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted, and declared
advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) resolved to recommend the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger by ChemoCentryx’s stockholders and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be
submitted to a vote of ChemoCentryx’s stockholders. The Board unanimously recommends that ChemoCentryx stockholders vote “FOR” the
Merger Proposal. In addition, the Board unanimously recommends that ChemoCentryx stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Compensation
Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (page 54)
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (referred to as “Goldman Sachs”) delivered its opinion to the Board that, as of August 3, 2022, and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $52.00 in cash per share of ChemoCentryx common stock to be paid to the holders
(other than Amgen and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
14
Table of Contents
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 3, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory
services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs
opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of ChemoCentryx’s common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other
matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between ChemoCentryx and Goldman Sachs, ChemoCentryx has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a
transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement of ChemoCentryx’s entry into the Merger
Agreement, to be approximately $40.0 million, payable upon the consummation of the Merger.
Certain Effects of the Merger on ChemoCentryx (page 35)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into ChemoCentryx, with
ChemoCentryx surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term “surviving corporation” to
refer to ChemoCentryx as the surviving corporation following the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the capital
stock of the surviving corporation.
The effective time of the Merger (referred to as the “Effective Time”) will occur, if it occurs, upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later date and time as we and Amgen may agree in writing and specify in such certificate of
merger). Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term “Closing Date” to refer to the date on which the closing of the Merger occurs.
Effect on ChemoCentryx if the Merger is Not Consummated (page 35)
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx common stock
entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, ChemoCentryx stockholders will not receive
any payment for their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, ChemoCentryx will remain a public
company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file
periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, ChemoCentryx may be required to pay
Amgen a termination fee, as described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee; Certain Expenses” beginning on page 101 of this proxy
statement.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the Merger not to be
consummated, the price of our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common
stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Merger Consideration (page 36)
In the Merger, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than Cancelled Shares, Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, each as
defined below) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all shares of ChemoCentryx common
stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will automatically be cancelled, and will cease to exist, and each holder of a share
represented by a certificate (referred to as “Certificates”) or non-certificated and represented by book-entry (referred to as “Book-Entry Shares”,
with those held through the DTC referred to as “DTC Book-Entry Shares” and those not held through DTC are referred to as “Non-DTC Book-Entry
Shares”), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of ChemoCentryx common stock, will cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of ChemoCentryx common stock other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
15
Table of Contents
As described further under “The Merger Agreement—Payment for ChemoCentryx Common Stock” beginning on page 81 of this proxy statement,
on the Closing Date, Amgen will deposit or cause to be deposited cash in an amount necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration with an
exchange agent designated by Amgen that is reasonably acceptable to ChemoCentryx (referred to as the “exchange agent”) (which amount will not
include any amounts payable to the holders of ChemoCentryx equity awards, which amounts will be paid through the payroll system of Amgen or
the surviving corporation). Promptly after consummation of the Merger, holders of Certificates will receive a letter of transmittal instructing them to
send their Certificates to the exchange agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of our common stock represented by such
Certificates.
At the Effective Time, any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, directly by
ChemoCentryx as treasury stock, directly by Amgen or directly by Merger Sub (referred to as “Cancelled Shares”) will automatically be cancelled
and will cease to exist, and no consideration or payment will be delivered in exchange for such shares. At the Effective Time, any shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock held by any subsidiary of ChemoCentryx or by any subsidiary of Amgen (other than Merger Sub) (referred to as
“Excluded Shares”) will be converted into such number of shares of the surviving corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same
percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the surviving corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in
ChemoCentryx immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Further, any shares of ChemoCentryx common stock owned by stockholders who did not vote in favor of approving the Merger Proposal and
who are entitled to demand and have properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with all applicable provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (referred to as “Section 262”) and do not thereafter fail to perfect, withdraw, or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under
Delaware law (referred to as “Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof
will be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. See “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 68 of this
proxy statement.
After the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
you will no longer have any rights as a ChemoCentryx stockholder as a result of the Merger (except that any holder of Dissenting Shares will have
those rights granted under Section 262), nor will you be entitled to receive any shares in Amgen or the surviving corporation.
Treatment of ChemoCentryx Equity Awards (page 79)
Under the Merger Agreement, each ChemoCentryx stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock purchasable upon exercise of such ChemoCentryx stock option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such ChemoCentryx stock option. Any ChemoCentryx stock options, whether vested or
unvested, with a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration will be cancelled for no consideration as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.
The Merger Agreement also provides that each RSU that was granted (A) prior to August 3, 2022 or granted after August 3, 2022 and
specified in the Disclosure Schedules and/or (B) to a non-employee member of the Board and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock subject to such RSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration. Each RSU that was granted on or after August 3,
2022 (other than to a non-employee member of the Board and subject to certain exceptions specified in the Disclosure Schedules) and that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into an Amgen Cash Award, representing the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the
16
Table of Contents
product of (i) the total number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock subject to such RSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, which will
vest and become payable at the same time as such RSU would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms, subject to continued
employment.
The Merger Agreement further provides that each restricted stock award that was granted prior to August 3, 2022 or to a non-employee
member of the Board that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration.
All amounts that become due in respect of outstanding ChemoCentryx equity awards will be less any required withholding taxes and without
interest.
Treatment of the ESPP (page 79)
The Merger Agreement provides that ChemoCentryx will take all actions as may be necessary to ensure that, except for the Final Offering
Period, no new offering periods under the ESPP will commence following August 3, 2022, there will be no increase in the amount of payroll
deductions or payroll contributions permitted to be made by the participants under the ESPP during the current offering period, except those made in
accordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of August 3, 2022, and no individuals shall commence participation in the ESPP
following August 3, 2022. If the Effective Time occurs during the Final Offering Period, (w) the final exercise date under the ESPP will be such date as
ChemoCentryx determines in its sole discretion (which date must be no later than the date that is five business days prior to the Effective Time), (x)
each ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP as of such final exercise date, (y) the ESPP will terminate effective as of no later than one business day prior to the
Closing Date, and no further rights will be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter, and (z) as promptly as practicable following the purchase
of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in accordance with the preceding clause (x), ChemoCentryx will return to each participant the funds, if
any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase. For additional information regarding the ESPP, see “The Merger Agreement—
Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP” beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement.
Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of ChemoCentryx in the Merger (page 62)
In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, our stockholders should be aware that members of the
Board and ChemoCentryx’s executive officers may have various interests in the Merger that may be in addition to, or different from, the interests of
ChemoCentryx stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of these potential interests and considered them at the time they
approved the Merger Agreement and in making their recommendation that the ChemoCentryx stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These
potential interests include, but may not be limited to:
•
each member of the Board and each of ChemoCentryx’s executive officers holds outstanding ChemoCentryx equity awards. All such
equity awards outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement will vest at the Effective Time as described under the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP” beginning on page 79;
•
each of ChemoCentryx’s executive officers is party to a preexisting employment agreement that provides for severance payments and
benefits upon a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control (including the Merger);
•
if an executive officer experiences a qualifying termination prior to payment of fiscal year 2022 bonuses, the executive officer will remain
eligible to receive his or her 2022 bonus (which will be prorated and paid assuming target performance levels if such termination occurs
prior to December 31, 2022); and
17
Table of Contents
•
continued indemnification in favor of the current and former directors and officers of ChemoCentryx, as well as certain obligations
related to maintenance of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
For additional information on the potential interests of members of the Board and ChemoCentryx’s executive officers in the Merger, see “The
Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of ChemoCentryx in the Merger” beginning on page 62.
Financing of the Merger (pages 67 and 96)
The consummation of the Merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Amgen. However, ChemoCentryx has agreed that it will use
its reasonable best efforts to provide to Amgen and Merger Sub such cooperation as may be necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably
requested by Amgen in connection with Amgen’s arrangement of any third-party debt or equity financing for the purpose of financing the
aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by the Merger Agreement or otherwise required or undertaken
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions and exceptions set
forth in the Merger Agreement and as further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Financing of the Merger ”.
ChemoCentryx has also agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices,
cooperate with Amgen and take all other actions to facilitate the termination at closing of all commitments in respect of ChemoCentryx’s existing
credit agreement (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Financing of the Merger”), the repayment in full on
the Closing Date of all obligations in respect of the indebtedness under ChemoCentryx’s existing credit agreement, and the release on the Closing
Date of any liens securing all such indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith, subject to Amgen providing all funds required to effect all
such repayments (or other arrangements) at the closing.
Appraisal Rights (page 68)
If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash
for the fair value of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value. The “fair value” of your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than,
or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as
“appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should
recognize that the fair value of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or
less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the
procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the
withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to
exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.

Table of Contents
A holder of record of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares through the
Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii)
strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v)
in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the
demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary
evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices
given by ChemoCentryx and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Appraisal
Rights”), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of ChemoCentryx common stock exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

rights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who
desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before
electing or attempting to exercise such rights. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Appraisal
Rights”.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 72)
The receipt of cash for shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in the Merger generally
will result in such U.S. Holder’s recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the cash such U.S. Holder receives
in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock surrendered in the Merger. A Non-U.S. Holder
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-
U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States. Stockholders should refer to the discussion under “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement and consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state,
local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or other tax laws.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 75)
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be consummated until the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the
HSR Act has expired or been terminated. ChemoCentryx and Amgen filed their respective HSR Act notifications on August 17, 2022. We currently
do not expect that any other clearance, approval or consent would be required under any other applicable antitrust law in connection with the
Merger.
Litigation Related to the Merger (page 76)
Since the announcement of the entry into the Merger Agreement, a lawsuit entitled Meinking v. ChemoCentryx, Inc., was filed in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California, with ChemoCentryx and the members of the Board named as defendants.

No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals (page 89)
From August 3, 2022, until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective Time,
neither ChemoCentryx nor any of its subsidiaries can, and each of them must cause their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of, or that would reasonably be expected to result
in the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined and described under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and
Agreements—No Solicitation; ChemoCentryx Acquisition Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change” beginning on page 89 of
this proxy statement);
•
enter into or participate in any discussions (except solely to notify a person that makes any inquiry or offer with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal of the existence of the non-solicitation provisions contained in the Merger Agreement) or negotiations with,
furnish any information relating to ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books
or records of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any third party in connection with, or
for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating, an Acquisition Proposal;
•
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined and described under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and
Agreements—No Solicitation; ChemoCentryx Acquisition Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change” beginning on page 89 of
this proxy statement); or
•
authorize or enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other similar instrument or agreement, whether written or oral, binding or non-binding, relating to an Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if before obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date in favor of the Merger Proposal (which is referred to as the “ChemoCentryx
Stockholder Approval”), ChemoCentryx receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of ChemoCentryx’s
covenants and agreements related to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement and the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined and described under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; ChemoCentryx
Acquisition Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement), ChemoCentryx may, subject to certain
requirements:
•
engage in negotiations or discussions with such third party regarding such Acquisition Proposal; and
•
furnish non-public information to such third party so long as such information was or is concurrently made available to Amgen and
such person enters into a confidentiality agreement with ChemoCentryx on terms specified in the Merger Agreement. Except as
described below, ChemoCentryx is not permitted to, and is required to cause its representatives not to, directly or indirectly, effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize or enter into an agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case, as
described in more detail under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; ChemoCentryx
Acquisition Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement.

Table of Contents
Before obtaining the ChemoCentryx Stockholder Approval, the Board, in response to (i) ChemoCentryx’s receipt of a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that (A) did not result from a breach of ChemoCentryx’s covenants and agreements related to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger
Agreement and (B) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (ii) an Intervening Event (as defined and described under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No
Solicitation; ChemoCentryx Acquisition Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement), may effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of clause (i) above and subject to compliance with certain procedures specified in the Merger
Agreement, authorize and cause ChemoCentryx to terminate the Merger Agreement and, concurrently with such termination, enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.
However, the Board is not permitted to take the actions described in the paragraph immediately above unless, among other things, (i) the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) we provide Amgen with at least four business
days’ prior written notice of the intention to take such action, (iii) during such four business day period, we negotiate in good faith with Amgen (if
requested by Amgen) amendments or modifications to the terms of the Merger Agreement and (iv) following such four business day period, the
Board concludes, after considering the terms of any amendments or modifications to the Merger Agreement offered by Amgen, and after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the applicable Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or, if applicable, terminate the Merger
Agreement and enter into a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal, would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board under applicable law (all as described in more detail under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No
Solicitation; ChemoCentryx Acquisition Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement).
For a further discussion of the limitations on solicitation of Acquisition Proposals from third parties, the limitations on making an Adverse
Recommendation Change, approving or recommending a Superior Proposal, or terminating the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement for a Superior Proposal, see “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; ChemoCentryx Acquisition
Proposals; Adverse Recommendation Change” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement.

Attendance
All holders of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date, including stockholders of record and
beneficial owners of common stock registered in the “street name” of a bank, broker or other nominee, are invited to attend the Special Meeting. If you are
a stockholder of record, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver’s license, and proof of ownership of our common stock, such
as a bank or brokerage account statement. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent
account statement or voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership, along with proper
identification and you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid “legal proxy” from your bank,
broker or other nominee.
Voting in Person
Stockholders of record will be able to vote in person at the Special Meeting. If you plan to attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person,
you will be given a ballot at the meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in “street
name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must provide a “legal proxy” executed in your favor from your bank, broker or other nominee in order
to be able to vote in person at the Special Meeting.

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy
To ensure that your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you submit your proxy or
provide voting instructions for your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held in “street name” to your bank, broker or other nominee promptly, even if
you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person.
Shares of ChemoCentryx Common Stock Held by Record Holders
If you are a stockholder of record and your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock are registered in your name with our transfer agent, AST, you
may submit your proxy using one of the methods described below.
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting a proxy. You
can grant a proxy by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address as specified on the enclosed proxy
card. Your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct, and in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy
card, as described below. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy
electronically over the Internet or by telephone.
Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
October 17, 2022, the day preceding the Special Meeting, your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock will be voted in the manner directed by you on
your proxy card.
Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Special Meeting
will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without
indicating how you wish to vote, such shares of ChemoCentryx common stock represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” each of
the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If you fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of
record as of the close of business on the Record Date, unless you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person, your shares of common stock will not
be considered present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, and your failure to vote will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and will have no effect on the vote regarding the Merger Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal.
Shares of ChemoCentryx Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, your bank, broker or other
nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares. You may cause your shares to be voted through your bank,
broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or by the Internet or telephone
through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions provided to you by them if such a service is available.
Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote your shares on “routine” matters if you fail to
instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters. The Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation
Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal described in this proxy statement are “non-routine” matters, and your bank, broker and other nominee therefore
cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Accordingly, if you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not
provide voting instructions via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if applicable, or do not attend the Special Meeting
and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, such actions will result in a “broker non-vote.” Broker non-votes, if any,
will not be considered present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, will have the same
effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger

you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy by:
•
delivering a written notice of revocation of your proxy to our Corporate Secretary at ChemoCentryx, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 835
Industrial Road, Suite 600, San Carlos, CA 94070 prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 17, 2022, the day preceding the Special

•
submitting a new proxy by telephone or Internet prior to 11:59 pm Eastern Time on October 17, 2022, the day preceding the Special Meeting;
or
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting in person (simply attending the Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked).
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without taking one of the actions described above
will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to ChemoCentryx or by sending a
written notice of revocation to ChemoCentryx, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for
it to be received by ChemoCentryx before the Special Meeting. Please note that to be effective, your new proxy card, Internet or telephonic voting
instructions or written notice of revocation must be received by our Corporate Secretary prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 17, 2022, the day
preceding the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how
to change your vote or submit new voting instructions. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a valid “legal proxy” from your
bank, broker or other nominee. Any adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will allow
ChemoCentryx stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting, as adjourned or

among other reasons, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If a quorum is not present, then under our amended and restated bylaws, (i) the
chairperson of the Special Meeting or (ii) a majority in voting power of the stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, present in person or

shall have power to adjourn the Special Meeting until a quorum is present or represented, and notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the
time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in
person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. However, our amended and restated bylaws
provide that if any such adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after such adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting.
In addition, the Board could postpone the Special Meeting before it commences. If the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed to solicit
additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting
as adjourned or postponed.
In the event that there is present at the Special Meeting, in person or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the vote of our
stockholders necessary to adopt the Merger Agreement by approving the Merger Proposal, we do not currently anticipate that we will adjourn or

We currently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the fourth quarter of 2022, assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions

If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described
30Table of Contents
in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest,
if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the
Merger Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section
262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock
following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value
of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration
they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is
required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights.
Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their
legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.
A holder of record of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares through the Effective
Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies
with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of a
beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (B)
provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct
copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by ChemoCentryx and to be
set forth on the Chancery List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”), will be entitled to receive the
fair value of his, her or its shares of ChemoCentryx common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

"ChemoCentryx, Inc._20220914_DEFM14A_20340331_4518092.Pdf",CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement, and the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement, as well as information included in oral statements or other
written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf, contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical
facts. Forward-looking statements can usually be identified by the use of terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,”
“evolve,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “looking ahead,” “project,” “may,” “opinion,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “project,” “should,” “will” and
similar words or expressions. Stockholders are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may
involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and the following factors:
•
the inability to consummate the Merger within the anticipated time period, or at all, due to any reason, including the failure to obtain the
ChemoCentryx Stockholder Approval or the failure to satisfy the other conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including the
termination or expiration of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act;
•
the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances requiring us to pay Amgen a termination fee of $119,314,679;
•
risks that the proposed Merger disrupts our current plans and operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key employees;
•
the effect of the announcement, pendency or consummation of the Merger on our business relationships (including, without limitation,
customers, suppliers and other business partners), operating results and business generally;
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;
•
risks related to diverting the attention of our management and employees from ongoing business operations;
•
the inability to obtain the ChemoCentryx Stockholder Approval with respect to the Merger;
•
the risk that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not consummated;
•
the effect of the restrictions placed on our business activities and the limitations on our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger during
the pendency of the Merger, pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
•
the nature, cost and outcome of any litigation and other legal proceedings, including any such proceedings related to the Merger and
instituted against us and others;
•
the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are unable to solicit other Acquisition Proposals during the pendency of the
Merger;
•
the fact that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to our stockholders that are treated as U.S. Holders for United
States federal income tax purposes; and
•
the fact that our stockholders would forego the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of our
current strategy as an independent public company.
Consequently, no forward-looking statements may be guaranteed and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments
anticipated by such forward looking statements will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or
effects on, ChemoCentryx or its businesses or operations. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to
vary materially from the forward-looking statements. The foregoing review of risks and uncertainties that
33Table of Contents
could cause actual events to differ from expectations should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with statements that are
included herein and elsewhere, including the risk factors included in ChemoCentryx’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement and other reports filed with the SEC.
Any forward-looking statement made in this communication speaks only as of the date on which it is made. ChemoCentryx can give no assurance
that the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. ChemoCentryx undertakes no
obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be
made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If ChemoCentryx
does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those or other
forward-looking statements.

If the Merger Agreement is adopted by ChemoCentryx stockholders and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into ChemoCentryx, with ChemoCentryx continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Amgen.
At the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled
Shares, Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The common stock of ChemoCentryx is listed and trades on Nasdaq under the symbol “CCXI.” As a result of the Merger, ChemoCentryx will cease
to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. Prior to the Effective Time, we will cooperate with Amgen and use
reasonable best efforts to delist our common stock from Nasdaq and deregister our common stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time. Upon such delisting and deregistration, we will no longer be a publicly traded company and will no longer be required to file
periodic reports with the SEC, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any
shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation or Amgen.",44,44

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx common stock entitled
to vote thereon as of the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, ChemoCentryx stockholders will not receive any
payment for their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, ChemoCentryx will remain a public company, our
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with
the SEC.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be consummated, the price of
our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at
which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of
your shares of our common stock. If the Merger is not consummated, the Board will continue to evaluate and review our business operations, assets,
operating results, financial condition, prospects and business strategy, among other things, and make such changes as are deemed appropriate and
continue to seek to enhance stockholder value. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares
of ChemoCentryx common stock entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no
assurance that any other transaction acceptable to ChemoCentryx will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be
adversely impacted.
In addition, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, ChemoCentryx may be required to pay Amgen a termination
fee, as described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee; Certain Expenses” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement.

In the Merger, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares,
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and without any action by the
holders of such shares, will cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and cease to exist, and each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
After the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you
will no longer have any rights as a ChemoCentryx stockholder as a result of the Merger (except that any holder of Dissenting Shares will have those

Each of the exchange agent, the surviving corporation and Amgen will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to the Merger Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the exchange agent, the surviving corporation or Amgen, as the case may be, so deducts and

The Board, together with members of senior management of ChemoCentryx, regularly reviews and assesses the performance, future growth
prospects, business plans and overall strategic direction of ChemoCentryx, and considers a variety of strategic alternatives that may be available to
ChemoCentryx, including continuing to pursue its strategy as a standalone company or pursuing potential strategic or financing transactions with third
parties, in each case with the goal of maximizing stockholder value.
On March 3, 2020, the Board held a regularly-scheduled telephonic meeting at which members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and
representatives of Latham & Watkins LLP (referred to as “Latham & Watkins”), counsel to ChemoCentryx, were also present. At the meeting, members of
senior management of ChemoCentryx provided a business update to the Board, including, among other matters, an update with respect to
ChemoCentryx’s anticipated NDA filing for avacopan for the treatment of ANCA vasculitis and an update with respect to certain of ChemoCentryx’s
commercial partnerships and marketing efforts. At an executive session of the meeting, Dr. Thomas Schall, Chief Executive Officer of ChemoCentryx, led a
discussion regarding ChemoCentryx’s achievement of corporate goals during the 2019 year, as well as ChemoCentryx’s pipeline and preparation for
commercialization. During such executive session, Dr. Schall and members of the Board also discussed whether ChemoCentryx should consider the
possibility of a strategic partnership transaction, equity financing or a broader strategic transaction at such time. Following discussion, the Board
determined that members of senior management and the Board should continue to evaluate alternatives that may be available to ChemoCentryx, and that
it would be appropriate for members of senior management to participate in introductory calls with investment bankers that may assist with
ChemoCentryx’s consideration of a potential strategic transaction.
On April 3, 2020, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,
representatives of Latham & Watkins and, for a portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs. At the meeting, representatives of Goldman
Sachs discussed the biopharmaceutical market generally, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and trends in biopharmaceutical strategic
transactions. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed certain preliminary illustrative financial analyses of ChemoCentryx on a standalone basis
and the assumptions underlying such
36Table of Contents
preliminary analyses and noted that the same were illustrative analyses, reflected no risk adjustment and were subject to change. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs then discussed a potential strategic transaction process, including an illustrative timeline for such a process, and certain
biopharmaceutical companies that might have interest in considering a potential strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx. The Board then further
discussed, without representatives of Goldman Sachs present, ChemoCentryx’s engagement of Goldman Sachs to serve as ChemoCentryx’s financial
advisor with respect to a potential strategic transaction process, and the merits of initiating a strategic transaction process at such time. The Board’s
discussion included weighing the potential benefits of outreach to potential counterparties against the potential risks of such a process, as well as
discussion of the parties identified by Goldman Sachs as parties that may be interested in considering such a strategic transaction involving
ChemoCentryx. Representatives of Latham & Watkins then led a discussion with respect to maintaining confidentiality during a strategic transaction
process and the obligations and best practices in conducting such a process. Following discussion, the Board authorized ChemoCentryx’s engagement
of Goldman Sachs as ChemoCentryx’s financial advisor and authorized senior management of ChemoCentryx to work with Goldman Sachs to initiate a
process to explore a potential strategic transaction involving ChemoCentryx. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock on April 3,
2020 was $38.96.
In accordance with the Board’s direction, during the period between April 3, 2020 and June 1, 2020, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted 13
potential strategic transaction counterparties, including Amgen, to gauge their interest in a potential strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx. Of those
13 parties contacted, five such parties, including Amgen, entered into a non-disclosure agreement with ChemoCentryx and participated in management
presentation meetings with members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Goldman Sachs (such parties, other than Amgen,
referred to as “Party A,” “Party B,” “Party C” and “Party D”). Any standstill restrictions contained in these non-disclosure agreements expired no later
than twelve months following the date of the applicable non-disclosure agreement. Eight of the 13 parties who were contacted by representatives of
Goldman Sachs did not engage in discussions with ChemoCentryx or otherwise to pursue a potential strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx. None of
the parties contacted ultimately submitted an indication of interest with respect to an acquisition of ChemoCentryx.
On May 7, 2020, the Board held a regularly-scheduled telephonic meeting at which members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,
representatives of Latham & Watkins and, for a portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs, were also present. At the meeting, members of
senior management of ChemoCentryx provided a business update to the Board, including, among other matters, an update with respect to human
resources matters and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ChemoCentryx’s business. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then discussed trends in
the biopharmaceutical market and provided a summary of the strategic transaction process. Members of senior management of ChemoCentryx then
provided the Board with an update of certain interactions and discussions held with parties contacted in connection with ChemoCentryx’s strategic
transaction process and discussion ensued with respect to the status of the strategic transaction process and financial alternatives. During an executive
session of the meeting, the Board further discussed, among other matters, the status of the strategic transaction process and maximizing the value of
ChemoCentryx’s development programs.
On June 1, 2020, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,
representatives of Latham & Watkins and, for a portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed
the strategic transaction process conducted to date, including the responses received from each party contacted in such process and the fact that none
of the parties contacted had indicated interest in pursuing an acquisition of ChemoCentryx at such time. Representatives of Goldman Sachs noted that
several of the parties contacted expressed interest in exploring a potential partnership with ChemoCentryx, but that several parties had indicated that an
acquisition of ChemoCentryx would be challenging in light of the state of the market and ChemoCentryx’s recent stock price. Without representatives of
Goldman Sachs present, the Board then further discussed the strategic transaction process and ChemoCentryx’s financing alternatives, including whether
representatives of Goldman Sachs should reach out to additional parties that may be interested in pursuing an acquisition of ChemoCentryx. Following
37
Table of Contents
discussion, the Board approved and directed senior management of ChemoCentryx to pursue a public offering of ChemoCentryx’s common stock, the
formation of a pricing committee of the Board with respect to such public offering, and the termination of the strategic transaction process. The closing
price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock on June 1, 2020 was $60.96.
On June 4, 2020, representatives of Party D contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs by telephone. On that call, representatives of Party D
indicated that Party D was working through a potential path forward for an acquisition of ChemoCentryx and the potential structure of such a transaction,
which would be subject to approval by Party D’s board of directors.
On the morning of June 8, 2020, representatives of Party D contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs. On that call, representatives of Party D
indicated that Party D would not be able to pursue an acquisition of ChemoCentryx at such time.
Later on June 8, 2020, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the
meeting, Dr. Schall summarized further discussions between representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Party D, noting that such
discussions did not indicate that Party D would be prepared to further pursue an acquisition of ChemoCentryx at that time. Following discussion, the
Board authorized and directed senior management of ChemoCentryx to continue its pursuit of a public offering of ChemoCentryx’s common stock.
On June 10, 2020, ChemoCentryx announced its entry into an underwriting agreement with SVB Leerink LLC and Piper Sandler & Co., relating to the
issuance and sale of 5,200,000 shares of ChemoCentryx’s common stock and resulting in net proceeds to ChemoCentryx of approximately $282.9 million
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by ChemoCentryx. The closing price per share of
ChemoCentryx’s common stock on June 10, 2020 was $60.25.
Thereafter, ChemoCentryx continued to execute on its standalone plan, and on October 8, 2021, obtained FDA approval of TAVNEOS as an
Thereafter, ChemoCentryx continued to execute on its standalone plan, and on October 8, 2021, obtained FDA approval of TAVNEOS as an
adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis or ANCA vasculitis.
On October 15, 2021, Rachna Khosla, Senior Vice President, Business Development of Amgen, called Dr. Markus Cappel, Chief Business Officer
and Treasurer of ChemoCentryx and congratulated him on the approval of TAVNEOS. On November 15, 2021, Ms. Khosla and Dr. Cappel participated in a
telephone call, in which Ms. Khosla inquired about ChemoCentryx’s plans for commercialization and suggested that a conversation between Robert
Bradway, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Amgen, and Dr. Schall take place.
On December 7, 2021, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone conversation to discuss a potential partnership or collaboration
involving Amgen and ChemoCentryx. On that call, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway agreed to schedule an in-person meeting at ChemoCentryx’s headquarters
in San Carlos, California, to further discuss a potential business relationship involving ChemoCentryx and Amgen.
On January 7, 2022, ChemoCentryx and Amgen entered into a one-way non-disclosure agreement pursuant to which ChemoCentryx would share

confidential information with ChemoCentryx.
On February 25, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a videoconference meeting. During the meeting, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway
discussed possible structures of a potential business relationship between ChemoCentryx and Amgen, including the possibility that such a business
relationship might take the form of an acquisition of ChemoCentryx by Amgen. Mr. Bradway indicated to Dr. Schall his intent to discuss with Amgen’s
board of directors a potential acquisition of ChemoCentryx by Amgen, and requested Dr. Schall’s preliminary feedback with respect to the valuation range
that Dr. Schall thought would be acceptable to ChemoCentryx and the Board in such a transaction. Dr. Schall did not express his views with respect to a
valuation of ChemoCentryx, but noted that ChemoCentryx would evaluate any proposal for an acquisition of ChemoCentryx by Amgen and that, in
addition to TAVNEOS, ChemoCentryx’s pipeline, including its novel, orally-administered PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559, would need to be
considered. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock on February 25, 2022 was $30.63.
On February 27, 2022, Mr. Bradway contacted Dr. Schall by telephone and again expressed Amgen’s potential interest in considering an acquisition
of ChemoCentryx.
On March 1, 2022, following ChemoCentryx’s Q4 2021 earnings call, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone conversation. During
that call, Mr. Bradway reiterated Amgen’s interest in considering an acquisition of ChemoCentryx, noted that Amgen’s goal was to put together a
meaningful proposal, and inquired as to Dr. Schall’s feedback with respect to the valuation range that may be acceptable to ChemoCentryx and the Board.
Dr. Schall declined to provide his personal view with respect to a valuation of ChemoCentryx. Mr. Bradway indicated that, following further discussion
between Amgen’s representatives and Amgen’s financial advisor, PJT Partners LP (referred to as “PJT”), Mr. Bradway expected to deliver to Dr. Schall a
preliminary indication of interest for Amgen’s acquisition of ChemoCentryx and reiterated the common interests and common goals of ChemoCentryx and
Amgen.
On March 3, 2022, Mr. Bradway telephoned Dr. Schall and indicated that Amgen intended to deliver a preliminary indication of interest to acquire
ChemoCentryx at a per share cash purchase price of $42.50. Dr. Schall indicated to Mr. Bradway that he would discuss the proposal with, and could not
comment on behalf of, the Board, and that his personal view was that the proposed purchase price would not be sufficient to generate interest from the
Board in pursuing a potential transaction.
Later on March 3, 2022, Ms. Khosla, on behalf of Amgen, delivered to Dr. Schall a written non-binding indication of interest in which Amgen
proposed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx for a per share cash purchase price of $42.50, subject to, among other things,
customary due diligence and approval by Amgen’s board of directors. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock on March 3, 2022
was $24.42.
On March 7, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives
of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Goldman Sachs led a discussion
summarizing the discussions and
39

meetings between Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway leading to ChemoCentryx’s receipt of the March 3, 2022 non-binding indication of interest from Amgen.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board certain financial perspectives regarding the non-binding indication of interest received from
Amgen. Representatives of Latham & Watkins then reviewed certain legal aspects involved in the business combination process, as well as specific
considerations related to the proposed acquisition of ChemoCentryx by Amgen, including the fiduciary duties of the members of the Board in the context
of a sale of ChemoCentryx for cash consideration. Following a discussion of various alternative responses to the non-binding indication of interest
received from Amgen, the Board determined that the valuation proposed by the non-binding indication of interest undervalued ChemoCentryx and, as
such, that ChemoCentryx should decline Amgen’s offer and should not provide diligence information to, or engage in valuation discussions with, Amgen
unless Amgen meaningfully increased the value of its proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx.
Later on March 7, 2022, as directed by the Board, Dr. Schall telephoned Mr. Bradway and declined Amgen’s offer to acquire ChemoCentryx
pursuant to the March 3, 2022 non-binding indication of interest.
On March 18, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,
representatives of Latham & Watkins and, for a portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs. At the meeting, members of senior
management of ChemoCentryx led a discussion of certain preliminary and illustrative unaudited prospective financial information of ChemoCentryx with
respect to market opportunities associated with TAVNEOS for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis (referred to as “AAV”) and ChemoCentryx’s
product pipeline, including certain preliminary assumptions with respect to addressable patient population, market penetration, time to peak sales, peak
sales, probability of success as a function of clinical development stage, inflationary factors and pricing and exclusivity, as well as cost, royalties and
milestones, cash flow, tax and other capitalization considerations. The Board then participated in discussion, without representatives of Goldman Sachs
present, of Goldman Sachs’s engagement as ChemoCentryx’s financial advisor. Members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and the Board then
discussed a renewal of Goldman Sachs’s engagement. Following discussion, the Board approved the renewed engagement of Goldman Sachs as
ChemoCentryx’s financial advisor and directed members of management to execute a renewed engagement letter with Goldman Sachs. Immaterial
refinements to the preliminary and illustrative unaudited prospective financial information discussed at the March 18, 2022 meeting were made in advance
of the April 28, 2022 meeting of the Board described below.
On April 25, 2022, Ms. Khosla contacted Dr. Cappel via email to request a telephone call.
On April 26, 2022, Ms. Khosla and Dr. Cappel participated in a telephone call on which Ms. Khosla expressed that Amgen appreciated the level of
engagement between senior management of ChemoCentryx and senior management of Amgen and that Amgen wished to express its continued interest in
ChemoCentryx and TAVNEOS and its belief in the industrial logic of a potential business transaction between Amgen and ChemoCentryx.
On April 28, 2022, the Board held a regularly-scheduled telephonic meeting at which members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,
representatives of Latham & Watkins and, for a portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs and PricewaterhouseCoopers (referred to as
“PwC”), were also present. At the meeting, members of senior management of ChemoCentryx provided a business update to the Board, including, among
other matters, certain personnel changes, an update on a commercial advisory project led by PwC, and certain unaudited prospective financial information
of ChemoCentryx with respect to market opportunities associated with TAVNEOS for the treatment of AAV and ChemoCentryx’s product pipeline,
including certain assumptions with respect to addressable patient population, market penetration, time to peak sales, peak sales, probability of success as
a function of clinical development stage, inflationary factors and pricing and exclusivity, as well as cost, royalties and milestones, cash flow, tax and other
capitalization considerations. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Board preliminary financial analyses of ChemoCentryx on a
standalone basis.

On May 16, 2022, Mr. Bradway telephoned Dr. Schall and invited him to provide guidance on the valuation that would be sufficient to proceed with
negotiation of a potential acquisition of ChemoCentryx by Amgen. Dr. Schall indicated to Mr. Bradway that the Board had extensively discussed Amgen’s
proposal and determined that Amgen would need to increase its offer price in order for ChemoCentryx to further consider a potential transaction. Dr.
Schall declined to provide his personal view with respect to a valuation of ChemoCentryx.
On May 17, 2022, Mr. Bradway contacted Dr. Schall and indicated that representatives of PJT would contact representatives of Goldman Sachs to
further discuss Amgen’s interest in an acquisition of ChemoCentryx and the valuation of ChemoCentryx at which Amgen could propose an acquisition of
ChemoCentryx and which may be acceptable for ChemoCentryx’s further consideration of a potential transaction.
On May 18, 2022, a representative of PJT telephoned a representative of Goldman Sachs. On the call, the PJT representative discussed Amgen’s
interest in a potential acquisition of ChemoCentryx, including exploring alternative structures. The Goldman Sachs representative indicated that Amgen
would have to further increase its proposal to warrant engagement in discussions. The PJT representative asked for valuation guidance, but the Goldman
Sachs representative declined to provide any such guidance at such time, indicating that he would first need to discuss with ChemoCentryx.
On May 20, 2022, the PJT representative and the Goldman Sachs representative participated in a follow-up telephone call. On the call, the Goldman
Sachs representative, based on discussions with and guidance from ChemoCentryx, conveyed that a proposal by Amgen would likely need to be in the
$50s (on a price per share basis) in order for the Board to consider engagement in further discussions by ChemoCentryx with Amgen regarding a potential
business combination.
On June 4, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call on which they discussed the May 20, 2022 phone call between
representatives of PJT and representatives of Goldman Sachs. On the call, Mr. Bradway suggested that Amgen continued to be interested in exploring a
potential transaction with ChemoCentryx and was evaluating the valuation guidance provided to representatives of PJT. Mr. Bradway suggested that he
and Dr. Schall endeavor to speak again in the coming week.
On June 9, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call. During such call, Mr. Bradway indicated to Dr. Schall that Amgen
needed assistance in answering a handful of diligence questions before Amgen would be in a position to increase its proposed offer price and submit a
revised indication of interest for the acquisition of ChemoCentryx by Amgen. Following the call, representatives of Amgen delivered to members of senior
management of ChemoCentryx such diligence questions.
On June 10, 2022, members of senior management of ChemoCentryx delivered to representatives of Amgen ChemoCentryx’s responses to the
diligence questions delivered by Amgen on June 9, 2022.
On June 15, 2022, Mr. Bradway telephoned Dr. Schall and indicated that Amgen expected to deliver an updated proposed purchase price for
Amgen’s acquisition of ChemoCentryx in the coming week.

ChemoCentryx and indicated that Amgen would increase its proposed purchase price to $51.00 per share. Dr. Schall indicated that he would need to
discuss Amgen’s revised proposal with, and could not comment on behalf of, the Board. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock
on June 22, 2022 was $22.17.

On June 24, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives
of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, Dr. Schall updated the Board with respect to his conversation with Mr. Bradway on June 23, 2022, and the revised
per share purchase price of $51.00 relayed by Mr. Bradway. Members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and the Board then discussed the
unaudited prospective financial information provided to the Board on April 28, 2022, including certain assumptions reflected therein with respect to
addressable patient population and market penetration and potential outcomes for the commercialization of TAVNEOS in indications for AAV and
ChemoCentryx’s pipeline products. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then summarized the progression of ChemoCentryx’s discussions with Amgen
since the receipt of Amgen’s March 3, 2022 non-binding indication of interest, and reviewed Goldman Sachs’s preliminary financial analysis of
ChemoCentryx and of Amgen’s proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed certain other biopharmaceutical companies who may be
interested in an acquisition of ChemoCentryx and who would be the most likely to be capable of consummating such a transaction. Representatives of
Latham & Watkins also reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties in the context of a sale of ChemoCentryx for cash consideration.
Following discussion, the Board authorized senior management of ChemoCentryx to continue engaging with Amgen on a limited basis, including by
making available to representatives of Amgen certain diligence information relating to ChemoCentryx, and further directed management to convey to
representatives of Amgen that access to diligence materials would be provided on the basis that Amgen use its diligence investigation of ChemoCentryx
to further improve upon its $51.00 per share proposal before a potential strategic transaction would be further considered.
On June 29, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call. On that call, Dr. Schall indicated to Mr. Bradway that ChemoCentryx
would provide representatives of Amgen with access to certain diligence information, but that the Board had directed management of ChemoCentryx to
engage with Amgen on a limited basis while Amgen completed its diligence investigation and that the Board expected Amgen to use the results of such
diligence investigation to further improve upon its $51.00 per share proposal. Mr. Bradway indicated that Amgen’s representatives were prepared to
commence diligence and acknowledged the expectation of the Board.
On July 3, 2022, ChemoCentryx granted representatives of Amgen access to an electronic data room containing due diligence information regarding
ChemoCentryx.
On July 8, 2022, the Board participated in a telephone call, which also included representatives of Latham & Watkins and, for a portion of the call,
representatives of Goldman Sachs. On the call, Dr. Schall updated the Board on his discussions with Mr. Bradway and noted to the Board that
representatives of Amgen had been granted access to ChemoCentryx’s data room. The Board also discussed whether any other biopharmaceutical
companies might have interest in a potential strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx, including certain potential counterparties identified by Goldman
Sachs and previously discussed with the Board. The Board’s discussion included weighing the potential benefits of outreach to other potential
counterparties against the potential risks, including the risk of leaks inherent in such a process and the potential impact on ChemoCentryx’s business of
such leaks. As part of this discussion, the Board considered prior interactions between ChemoCentryx management and other industry participants,
including ChemoCentryx’s strategic transaction process in 2020. Without members of Goldman Sachs present, representatives of Latham & Watkins then
reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties in the context of a sale of ChemoCentryx for cash consideration and the Board further
discussed outreach to other biopharmaceutical companies.
On July 12, 2022, Dr. Schall received an email from the Chief Executive Officer of a biopharmaceutical company (referred to as “Party E”) requesting
a telephone call. On July 13, 2022, the Chief Executive Officer of Party E and Dr. Schall participated in a telephone call. On that call, Party E’s Chief
Executive Officer indicated that Party E was interested in exploring a potential business combination with ChemoCentryx and that Party E would be
delivering to ChemoCentryx a written indication of interest for the acquisition of ChemoCentryx for a per share cash purchase price equal to $36.00,
subject to customary due diligence and approval by Party E’s board of directors. Dr. Schall indicated that he would need to discuss Party E’s proposal
with, and could not

Table of Contents
comment on behalf of, the Board, and that his personal view was that the proposed $36.00 per share purchase price would not be sufficient to generate
interest from the Board in pursuing a potential transaction. Later in the day on July 13, 2022, representatives of Party E delivered to Dr. Schall a written
non-binding indication of interest for Party E’s acquisition of ChemoCentryx for a cash purchase price of $36.00 per share, which non-binding indication
of interest included a financing commitment letter from Party E’s financial advisor. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock on July
13, 2022 was $23.02.
Later on July 13, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Goldman Sachs and
representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, Dr. Schall updated the Board with respect to his conversation with the Chief Executive Officer of
Party E and the non-binding indication of interest received from Party E on July 13, 2022, proposing an acquisition of ChemoCentryx for a per share
purchase price of $36.00. Following discussion, the Board determined that, in light of the low valuation ascribed to ChemoCentryx in Party E’s July 13,
2022 indication of interest, management of ChemoCentryx should decline further discussions with Party E with respect to a potential business
combination unless and until Party E significantly increased the purchase price of its proposal.
On July 14, 2022, as directed by the Board, Dr. Schall contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Party E and informed him that the Board had
determined that the value ascribed to ChemoCentryx in Party E’s July 13, 2022 indication of interest was not at a price that warranted further discussions
with respect to a potential business combination unless and until Party E significantly increased the purchase price of its proposal.
On July 19, 2022, representatives of Party E delivered to Dr. Schall a revised non-binding written indication of interest pursuant to which Party E
proposed an acquisition of ChemoCentryx at a per share price equal to $40.00. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock on July 19,
2022 was $23.54.
On July 20, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of
Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, Dr. Schall provided the Board an update on recent diligence discussions between representatives of Amgen and
representatives of ChemoCentryx. Dr. Schall also provided the Board an update with respect to Party E, including Dr. Schall’s conversation with the Chief
Executive Officer of Party E on July 14, 2022 and the revised non-binding indication of interest received from Party E on July 19, 2022. Following
discussion, the Board directed members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Goldman Sachs to convey to representatives of
Party E the need for Party E to increase its offer price prior to ChemoCentryx providing Party E with due diligence information. The Board, representatives
of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins then discussed certain other biopharmaceutical companies who would be considered most
likely to have interest in acquiring ChemoCentryx and who would be the most likely to be capable of completing an acquisition of ChemoCentryx.
Following such discussion, the Board directed representatives of Goldman Sachs to contact four other global biopharmaceutical companies (including
Party A, Party C, Party D, and one other biopharmaceutical company referred to as “Party F”) with respect to their potential interest in an acquisition of
ChemoCentryx.
Between July 21, 2022, and July 26, 2022, as directed by the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of each of Party A,
Party C, Party D and Party F to inquire as to whether such parties would be interested in a potential sale transaction involving ChemoCentryx. Between
July 21, 2022, and July 28, 2022, representatives of Party C, Party D and Party F indicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs, without providing a
specific reason, that each such party was not interested in engaging with ChemoCentryx at such time with respect to a potential sale transaction. Also
during the same period, Representatives of Party A indicated that Party A would need to discuss internally to determine Party A’s level of interest and
whether Party A would like to proceed with discussions regarding a potential transaction.
On July 21, 2022, as directed by the Board, Dr. Schall participated in a telephone call with the Chief Executive Officer of Party E. On that call, Dr.
Schall informed the Chief Executive Officer of Party E that the Board had determined that the value ascribed to ChemoCentryx in Party E’s July 19, 2022
indication of interest was inadequate to engage in further discussions.
43
Table of Contents
On July 22, 2022, representatives of Party E participated in a telephone call with representatives of Goldman Sachs and indicated that Party E felt
that an offer of $40.00 per share was substantial and should warrant engagement. Consistent with the Board’s direction, representatives of Goldman
Sachs indicated to the representatives of Party E that ChemoCentryx would consider a potential strategic transaction with Party E, but that the valuation
ascribed to ChemoCentryx in Party E’s July 19, 2022 indication of interest would need to be increased first. Based on direction from the Board,
representatives of Goldman Sachs suggested that in order to warrant engagement with ChemoCentryx, a proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx should reflect
a per share purchase price in the $50s. Representatives of Party E suggested that Party E was unlikely to reach a per share purchase price consistent with
that guidance and that Party E may need to move in a different direction.
On July 26, 2022, the Board held a regularly-scheduled meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Latham & Watkins, members of
senior management of ChemoCentryx and, for a portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs. At the meeting, members of senior
management of ChemoCentryx provided a business update to the Board, including, among other matters, certain personnel changes, a commercial update
with respect to, among other matters, the TAVNEOS launch, a clinical development update and a legal update. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then
provided an update with respect to its outreach to Party A, Party C, Party D and Party F, the July 22, 2022 discussion between representatives of Goldman
Sachs and representatives of Party E, and the status of discussions with Amgen.
Also on July 26, 2022, a Goldman Sachs representative inquired with a representative of Party A as to whether Party A might be interested in
potentially pursuing a business combination with ChemoCentryx. The Party A representative indicated that Party A would likely be interested.
Also on July 26, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call on which Dr. Schall provided an update with respect to matters
being discussed by representatives of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Amgen and indicated to Mr. Bradway that significant progress had been
made with respect to such matters. Mr. Bradway acknowledged the progress made in Amgen’s diligence investigation of ChemoCentryx.
On the evening of July 26, 2022, representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to Amgen (referred to as “Wachtell Lipton”), provided
an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Latham & Watkins. The initial draft of the Merger Agreement, among other things, provided
for a one-step merger transaction and a termination fee of 4.0% of the aggregate equity value of the transaction payable in certain circumstances.
On July 27, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call on which Mr. Bradway indicated that, subject to continued progress
with respect to Amgen’s diligence investigation of ChemoCentryx, and subject to approval by Amgen’s board of directors, Amgen was prepared to
increase its per share offer price for an acquisition of ChemoCentryx to $52.00.
Also on July 27, 2022, Dr. Schall and the Chief Executive Officer of Party E participated in a telephonic conversation. The Chief Executive Officer of
Party E stated that Party E had significant interest in engaging in a potential transaction with ChemoCentryx and felt that its substantial improvement to
its July 13, 2022 indication of interest should warrant engagement and access to diligence. The Chief Executive Officer of Party E also stated that he
believed certain stockholders of ChemoCentryx would find an offer of $40.00 per share compelling. The Chief Executive Officer of Party E suggested Party
E’s willingness and preference to engage privately with ChemoCentryx but noted that he was prepared to present Party E’s proposal publicly to
ChemoCentryx stockholders. Consistent with prior direction from the Board, Dr. Schall reiterated the message that the value ascribed to ChemoCentryx in
Party E’s July 19, 2022 indication of interest was not at a price that warranted further discussions with respect to a potential business combination unless
and until Party E significantly increased the purchase price of its proposal.

On July 28, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of
Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, Dr. Schall provided the Board an update on recent diligence discussions with Amgen and Dr. Schall’s recent
discussion with Party E’s Chief Executive Officer. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided an update on discussions with Party A’s
representatives. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided an update on Party C, Party D, and Party F, noting to the Board that each such party
had decided not to engage. Following discussion, the Board directed members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Goldman
Sachs to continue engaging with Party E on a limited basis, to convey to representatives of Party E the need for Party E to increase its offer price prior to
ChemoCentryx providing Party E with due diligence information and to convey to representatives of Party E that for a proposal by Party E to acquire
ChemoCentryx to be compelling to the Board such proposal would need to reflect a per share purchase price in the $50s. The Board further directed
members of senior management of ChemoCentryx, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins to continue engaging with
Amgen and its representatives with respect to negotiation of the draft Merger Agreement, and to engage with Party A in parallel including by providing
guidance on valuation and timing. The Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins then discussed certain other
biopharmaceutical companies who would be considered most likely to have interest in acquiring ChemoCentryx and who would be most likely to be able
to complete an acquisition of ChemoCentryx. Following such discussion, the Board directed representatives of Goldman Sachs to contact one additional
biopharmaceutical company (referred to as “Party G”) to gauge its potential interest in an acquisition of ChemoCentryx. Party G was contacted by
representatives of Goldman Sachs in May 2020 as part of ChemoCentryx’s 2020 strategic transaction process, but did not enter into a non-disclosure
agreement with ChemoCentryx during such time or otherwise indicate interest in a potential acquisition of ChemoCentryx during such process.
Later on July 28, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a representative of Party A with guidance that a transaction was likely to happen
in the near-term, and that it was important for Party A to provide a proposal quickly. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also indicated that, in order to be
competitive, Party A would need to be able to support a proposal in the $50s (on a price per share basis). The Party A representative indicated that Party
A was prepared to move in line with the timing guidance and could see a path to a proposal price in line with the price guidance provided. Between July
28, 2022 and July 29, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, representatives of Latham & Watkins, and representatives of counsel for Party A
negotiated the terms of a non-disclosure agreement. On July 29, 2022, ChemoCentryx and Party A executed a non-disclosure agreement.
Later on July 28, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Party G discussed whether Party G would be interested in a
potential transaction involving ChemoCentryx. The representatives of Party G indicated that they would need to discuss internally and would revert.
Party G never followed up with representatives of Goldman Sachs.
Also on July 28, 2022, representatives of Party E contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs and indicated that Party E remained interested in a
potential strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx. Consistent with the Board’s direction, representatives of Goldman Sachs reiterated their previous
guidance that a compelling proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx would reflect a per share purchase price in the $50s. Representatives of Party E indicated
that Party E was prepared to submit a revised indication of interest, but that Party E was unlikely to reach a per share purchase price level consistent with
that guidance. Representatives of Party E also suggested that, while Party E would like to pursue a potential transaction privately, Party E would be
willing to explore other paths, including potentially reaching out to ChemoCentryx stockholders directly.
On July 29, 2022, ChemoCentryx granted representatives of Party A access to an electronic data room containing due diligence information
regarding ChemoCentryx.
Also on July 29, 2022, representatives of Party E delivered to Dr. Schall a further revised non-binding written indication of interest pursuant to
which Party E proposed an acquisition of ChemoCentryx at a per share price equal to $44.00. The closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common
stock on July 29, 2022 was $23.62.

On July 30, 2022, representatives of Latham & Watkins sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton.
Thereafter, during the period from July 30, 2022 through the early afternoon of August 3, 2022, representatives of ChemoCentryx and Amgen and their
respective legal advisors negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement. Key terms of the Merger Agreement negotiated between the parties included: (1)
the terms of the “no-shop” restrictions and the circumstances in which the Board could change its recommendation to ChemoCentryx’s stockholders or in
which ChemoCentryx could negotiate or accept an alternative acquisition transaction, including the circumstances in which the Merger Agreement could
be terminated by ChemoCentryx; (2) the amount of the termination fee and the circumstances in which it would be payable by ChemoCentryx; (3) the
definition of “Material Adverse Effect” with respect to ChemoCentryx; (4) the conditions to each party’s obligation to complete the Merger; (5) the
parties’ commitments in connection with obtaining required regulatory approvals and the extent to which the parties would be obligated to agree to
remedies in connection with obtaining such regulatory approvals; (6) the interim operating covenants applicable to ChemoCentryx prior to the closing of
the Merger and related exceptions; and (7) ChemoCentryx’s other representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement. The Board was
kept apprised of these discussions.
On July 31, 2022, representatives of Latham & Watkins delivered an initial draft merger agreement to representatives of counsel for Party A. On the
same date, members of senior management of ChemoCentryx, together with representatives of Goldman Sachs, delivered a management presentation to
representatives of Party A via videoconference.
On August 1, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,
representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, Dr. Schall provided the Board an update on his recent
discussions with Mr. Bradway, including his July 27, 2022 phone call on which Mr. Bradway indicated that Amgen would be prepared to increase its per
share proposal from $51.00 to $52.00. Dr. Schall also provided the Board an update with respect to Party E, including a summary of the further revised
non-binding indication of interest received from Party E on July 29, 2022. Members of senior management of ChemoCentryx, together with representatives
of Latham & Watkins, then provided the Board with an update on the negotiation of the Merger Agreement and recent discussions held between
representatives of ChemoCentryx and Amgen and their respective legal advisors with respect to certain material terms of the Merger Agreement.
Representatives of Latham & Watkins then reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties in the context of a sale of ChemoCentryx for
cash consideration. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then updated the Board on its outreach to Party A, Party C, Party D, Party F and Party G,
including that a non-disclosure agreement had been executed by ChemoCentryx and Party A and a draft merger agreement had been provided to Party A,
and that each other potential acquirer contacted had either expressly indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a transaction at this time or, in the
case of Party G, had not followed up with Goldman Sachs following Goldman Sachs’s initial outreach. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided an
update on their discussions with representatives of Party E and with respect to the revised non-binding indication of interest received from Party E on
July 29, 2022. Following discussion, the Board instructed senior management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Latham & Watkins to continue
negotiation of the Merger Agreement with representatives of Amgen and Wachtell Lipton, and to continue engagement with Party A and Party E. The
Board also directed senior management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Goldman Sachs to continue seeking a definitive proposal on valuation
from Party A and to continue expressing to representatives of Amgen the Board’s expectation that Amgen would continue to evaluate the valuation of
ChemoCentryx during the course of its diligence investigation and negotiation of the Merger Agreement.
Later on August 1, 2022, representatives of Party E participated in a telephone call with representatives of Goldman Sachs. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs stated they were prepared to share a non-disclosure agreement with Party E and willing to share diligence information regarding
ChemoCentryx if Party E believed that it could likely put forth a proposal in line with the previous guidance in the $50s (on a price per share basis).
Representatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed that timing was of the essence and encouraged Party E to move quickly and execute the non-
disclosure agreement in order to receive diligence information.

Table of Contents
Subsequently, on August 1, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided representatives of Party E with a non-disclosure agreement. During
the period of August 2, 2022 to August 3, 2022, representatives of Latham & Watkins negotiated the terms of such non-disclosure agreement with
representatives of Party E and its legal counsel. As of the evening on August 3, 2022, the final terms of the non-disclosure agreement for Party E were not
finalized. The non-disclosure agreement was never executed by Party E.
Also on August 1, 2022, senior management of ChemoCentryx and Party A, together with representatives of Latham & Watkins and counsel for
Party A, participated in videoconferences to discuss intellectual property and tax due diligence matters.
On the morning of August 2, 2022, Dr. Schall and Mr. Bradway participated in a telephone call. On that call, Dr. Schall emphasized the significant
progress that had been made with respect to ChemoCentryx’s responses to Amgen’s diligence inquiries and negotiation of the Merger Agreement. Dr.
Schall also noted that the Board had authorized management’s engagement with Amgen and access to diligence materials on the basis that Amgen would
use the same to improve upon its valuation proposal. Dr. Schall noted that, based on discussions with the Board, a per share purchase price of $54.50
would generate interest from the Board in approving a potential transaction. Mr. Bradway indicated that he did not think there would be any additional
room above the $52.00 per share proposal previously communicated, but that he would consider the matter further and revert.
Also on the morning on August 2, 2022, representatives of Party A communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that, after internal review,
Party A would not be interested in consummating a transaction at the valuation being considered by ChemoCentryx.
In the early afternoon on August 2, 2022, Mr. Bradway telephoned Dr. Schall and indicated that Amgen would not raise its per share purchase price
above $52.00 per share.
Later in the afternoon on August 2, 2022, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management
of ChemoCentryx, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, Dr. Schall updated the Board with respect
to his conversation with Mr. Bradway and Amgen’s unwillingness to increase its offer price above the $52.00 per share proposal previously
communicated. Dr. Schall also updated the Board with respect to Party A’s inability to consummate a transaction at the valuation being contemplated, as
well as Party E’s request for diligence information. Dr. Schall and representatives of Goldman Sachs noted that Party E’s request for diligence information
did not include a revised valuation proposal from Party E, and the Board discussed Party E’s previous per share proposal of $44.00 per share and Party
E’s ability to finance a transaction at a higher valuation based on publicly available information. Members of senior management of ChemoCentryx,
together with representatives of Latham & Watkins, provided an update on the transaction process and an update regarding the negotiation of the
Merger Agreement, including a summary of the terms of the draft Merger Agreement that had been negotiated with representatives of Amgen and
Wachtell Lipton and material open items as of the time of the meeting. Representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed with the members of the Board
their fiduciary duties in the context of a sale of ChemoCentryx for cash consideration. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed Goldman Sachs’s
preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Merger. The Board also reviewed with members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and
representatives of Goldman Sachs the results of ChemoCentryx’s outreach process to solicit interest from alternative potential acquirors; it was the
consensus of the Board that re-engagement with the other potential acquirors contacted during the process or outreach to additional potential acquirors
was not likely to lead to an acquisition proposal superior to the Merger, could jeopardize the successful entry into an acquisition transaction with Amgen
at the per share price of $52.00 and could cause significant disruption and risk to ChemoCentryx. The Board noted the relationship disclosures provided
by Goldman Sachs regarding its relationship with Amgen; the Board did not identify any concerns with these disclosures. The Board then directed senior
management of ChemoCentryx and representatives of Latham & Watkins to continue the negotiation of the Merger Agreement.

During the evening of August 2, 2022 and continuing through the early afternoon of August 3, 2022, members of senior management of
ChemoCentryx and representatives of Latham & Watkins and Wachtell Lipton finalized the negotiation of all of the open issues in the Merger Agreement.
As part of this resolution, and among other matters, the parties agreed that the termination fee would be equal to approximately $119.3 million.
On August 3, 2022, after market close, the Board held a telephonic special meeting, which was also attended by members of senior management of
ChemoCentryx, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Latham & Watkins. Members of senior management of ChemoCentryx and
representatives of Latham & Watkins updated the Board on the negotiation of the Merger Agreement and disclosure schedules. Representatives of
Latham & Watkins reviewed modifications to the terms of the Merger Agreement since the meeting of the Board held the prior day. Representatives of
Latham & Watkins reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties in the context of a sale of ChemoCentryx for cash consideration, as they
had previously done. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed Goldman Sachs’s financial analyses with respect to the Merger and rendered its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 3, 2022, to the Board that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon
and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and other matters and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of
shares of ChemoCentryx common stock (other than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders. Upon consideration of the factors more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—
Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger”, the Board (1) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and its stockholders, (2) approved, adopted and declared advisable
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (3) directed the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted
to a vote at a meeting of ChemoCentryx’s stockholders and (4) resolved to recommend that ChemoCentryx’s stockholders vote to approve the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger. The foregoing approval of the Board was subsequently ratified by unanimous written consent of the
Board dated August 3, 2022.
Later on the night of August 3, 2022, following the meeting of the Board, ChemoCentryx, Amgen and Merger Sub executed the Merger Agreement.
Before market open on the morning of August 4, 2022, ChemoCentryx and Amgen publicly announced the execution of the Merger Agreement.",45,57

Recommendation of the Board
The Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to,
and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and its stockholders; (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; (iii) resolved to recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger
by ChemoCentryx’s stockholders; and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of ChemoCentryx’s stockholders.
The Board unanimously recommends that ChemoCentryx stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Merger Compensation
Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Board consulted with members of ChemoCentryx’s senior
management, representatives of ChemoCentryx’s legal advisor, Latham & Watkins, and representatives of ChemoCentryx’s financial advisor, Goldman
Sachs. In the course of reaching its
48Table of Contents
determination and recommendation, the Board reviewed, evaluated and considered a significant amount of information and numerous factors and
benefits, including those listed below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as supporting its (i) determination
that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of ChemoCentryx and its
stockholders; (ii) approval and adoption of, and declaration that it is advisable for ChemoCentryx to enter into, the Merger Agreement; (iii) resolution to
recommend that ChemoCentryx’s stockholders vote to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iv) direction that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of
ChemoCentryx’s stockholders at the Special Meeting:
•
Premium to Market Price. The Board considered the relationship of the Merger Consideration to the price of our common stock immediately
prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement and the recent historical market price and volatility of our common stock, including the fact
that the Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 123% to the $23.27 closing price per share of our common stock on
Nasdaq on August 2, 2022, the last trading day prior to the date on which the Merger Agreement was executed, a premium of approximately
118% to the trailing volume-weighted average price per share of $23.84 for the thirty (30) calendar day period ended August 2, 2022, and a
premium of approximately 138% to the trailing volume-weighted average price per share of $21.81 for the ninety (90) calendar day period
ended August 2, 2022. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration represents the highest value reasonably available for the shares
of our common stock for the foreseeable future, taking into account the Board’s familiarity with the business strategy, assets and prospects
of ChemoCentryx and the recent historical market price of our common stock.
•
Certainty of Value. The Board considered the all-cash nature of the Merger Consideration to be received by ChemoCentryx’s stockholders
in the Merger, which would provide liquidity and certainty of value to our stockholders while avoiding exposure to ChemoCentryx’s clinical,
regulatory, commercialization and other business risks. Taking into account the business, operations, prospects, strategic and short and
long term operating plans, assets, liabilities and financial condition of ChemoCentryx, the Board weighed the certainty of realizing
compelling value for shares of our common stock by virtue of the Merger against the uncertain prospect that the trading value of shares of
our common stock would approach the Merger Consideration in the foreseeable future and the risks and uncertainties associated with our
business generally, including those described below and those discussed in ChemoCentryx’s public filings with the SEC. See “Where You
Can Find More Information” beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement.
•
Possible Strategic Alternatives. The Board considered the process conducted by ChemoCentryx, with the assistance of representatives of
Goldman Sachs, to identify whether other potential parties might be interested in pursuing an acquisition of ChemoCentryx, taking into
account the expected interest of such parties generally, their financial capability to consummate a transaction of this size, and their ability to
move expeditiously and efficiently to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an acquisition of ChemoCentryx and consummate
such transaction. In particular, the Board considered the recent outreach by representatives of Goldman Sachs and members of
ChemoCentryx’s senior management with respect to such parties believed to be most likely to have interest in pursuing such an acquisition
of ChemoCentryx, and considered the responses received from such contacted parties, including the fact that only Party E (in addition to
Amgen) submitted a proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx (which the Board did not consider compelling relative to the terms of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger Consideration), that Party A had ultimately declined to submit a proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx, and that
parties that were considered reasonably likely to have potential interest in acquiring ChemoCentryx had either declined to engage with
ChemoCentryx regarding a potential sale transaction or had not responded to representatives of Goldman Sachs following their initial
outreach.
•
Full and Fair Value. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration of $52.00 per share of our common stock represents full and fair
value for our shares of common stock, taking into account the
49
Table of Contents
Board’s familiarity with the business strategy, assets and prospects of ChemoCentryx on a standalone basis and the relative certainty of the
cash consideration payable in the Merger as compared to the risks and uncertainties of continuing on a standalone basis as an independent
public company.
•
Highest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration of $52.00 per share of our common stock
represents the highest value reasonably obtainable for our shares of common stock for the foreseeable future, taking into account the
business, operations, prospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of ChemoCentryx. The Board also
considered the progress and the outcome of ChemoCentryx’s negotiations with Amgen, including the increase in the consideration offered
by Amgen from the time of its initial expression of interest to the end of the negotiations, a number of changes in the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement from the version initially proposed by Amgen that were favorable to ChemoCentryx, and the fact that a number of
other strategic parties that had been contacted with respect to a potential acquisition of ChemoCentryx had either determined not to engage
with ChemoCentryx, had determined that it would not be capable of entering into a strategic transaction with ChemoCentryx at such time, or
had otherwise failed to submit a proposal that the Board considered compelling relative to the terms of the Merger and the Merger
Consideration of $52.00 per share of our common stock. Further, the Board believed, based on these negotiations, that the Merger
Consideration was the highest price per share that Amgen was willing to pay and that the Merger Agreement contained the most favorable
terms to ChemoCentryx to which Amgen was willing to agree.
•
Likelihood of Consummation. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the likelihood of consummation, based upon the scope of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger,
the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, the remedies available to ChemoCentryx under the Merger Agreement in
the event of various breaches by Amgen, including specific performance, and Amgen’s reputation in the biopharmaceutical industry and its
financial capacity to complete an acquisition of this size, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction with Amgen
could be completed relatively expeditiously and in an orderly manner.
•
Goldman Sachs’ Opinion and Related Analyses. The Board considered the opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board on August 3,
2022, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated such date, that, as of such date and based upon and subject
to the assumptions, qualifications and other matters and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of
shares of ChemoCentryx common stock (other than those specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders, as well as its related analyses, as more fully described under “The Merger—Opinion of Goldman
Sachs & Co. LLC” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement.
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which was the product of arms’-
length negotiations with the assistance of ChemoCentryx’s advisors, including the structure of the transaction, the all-cash form of the
Merger Consideration, the limited scope of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, and the customary nature of the
representations, warranties, and the covenants and agreements of the parties. For the reasons noted below, the Board believed that the
provisions of the Merger Agreement were advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and our stockholders. In
particular:
•
No Financing Condition. The Board considered the representation of Amgen that Amgen would have sufficient cash or other liquid
financial resources or undrawn financial commitments to consummate the Merger, and that the consummation of the Merger is not
subject to a financing condition.
•
No Solicitation Covenants and Fiduciary Outs. The Board considered the non-solicitation covenants and “fiduciary out” provisions
of the Merger Agreement, which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof and limitations set forth therein, permit ChemoCentryx to
furnish information to, and to engage in discussions or negotiations with, third parties that make unsolicited Acquisition Proposals
50
Table of Contents
meeting certain criteria, permit the Board to change its recommendation to stockholders regarding the Merger Agreement under
certain circumstances and permit ChemoCentryx to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement
relating to a Superior Proposal, subject to, among other things, payment of a termination fee to Amgen. The Board further considered
its ability to change its recommendation to stockholders regarding the Merger Agreement in response to an Intervening Event if the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable law. The
Board further considered the fact that the approximately $119.3 million termination fee payable by ChemoCentryx in the event the
Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, in the opinion of the Board, (i) is reasonable in light of the overall terms
of the Merger Agreement and the benefits of the Merger, (ii) is consistent with the amount of such fees payable in comparable
transactions on a relative basis and (iii) would not be a substantial impediment or preclude another party from making a competing
proposal to acquire ChemoCentryx.
•
End Date. The Board considered the fact that the End Date under the Merger Agreement, on which either party, subject to certain
exceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement, allows for sufficient time to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, but also prevents the Merger Agreement from being extended for an unreasonable amount of time.
•
Enforcement. The Board considered ChemoCentryx’s ability to obtain specific enforcement of the obligations of Amgen and Merger
Sub under the Merger Agreement, thereby ensuring that ChemoCentryx has an appropriate remedy in the event Amgen and Merger
Sub were to decline to comply with their obligations under the Merger Agreement.
•
Stockholder Approval; Appraisal Rights. The Board considered that the adoption of the Merger Agreement would be subject to the
approval of our stockholders, that stockholders would be free to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and that
stockholders who do not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law
will be entitled to such appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.
•
Conditions to Closing; Interim Operations. The Board considered the fact that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
minimize, to the extent reasonably practical, the risk that a condition to consummation of the Merger would not be satisfied and also
provide reasonable flexibility to operate ChemoCentryx’s business during the pendency of the Merger, including with respect to
actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Board, in consultation with members of ChemoCentryx’s senior management, also assessed ChemoCentryx’s prospects for substantially
increasing stockholder value as a standalone company in excess of the Merger Consideration given the risks and uncertainties in ChemoCentryx’s
business, including, but not limited to, the following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance) and those discussed in ChemoCentryx’s
public filings with the SEC (see “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement):
•
the fact that ChemoCentryx has received orphan drug designation and orphan drug exclusivity for TAVNEOS in the United States, Japan
and the European Union in the disease for which it is approved, but may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation or orphan drug
exclusivity in other jurisdictions or for other indications of TAVNEOS for which ChemoCentryx pursues development or for any drug
product candidates, and ChemoCentryx may not be able to maintain orphan drug exclusivity for TAVNEOS, or maintain orphan drug
exclusivity for any drug product candidate for which ChemoCentryx may obtain orphan drug exclusivity;
•
the possible failure or delays of current or future preclinical studies or clinical trials;
•
ChemoCentryx’s reliance on third parties to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials and the risks and costs of engaging additional
partners or hiring additional personnel as ChemoCentryx’s preclinical, clinical and commercial activities increase;
51
Table of Contents
•
ChemoCentryx’s reliance on third party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply TAVNEOS and our drug product
candidates;
•
ChemoCentryx’s reliance on third party partners and sublicensees for the marketing, commercialization and sale of TAVNEOS in certain
territories;
•
the uncertainty of the outcomes of ongoing and planned clinical trials and the potential to not obtain regulatory approval, including the
potential identification of safety-related concerns associated with the use of a drug product candidate;
•
the significant risks and challenges associated with commercializing TAVNEOS, the costs associated with successfully scaling commercial
operations and the risk that ChemoCentryx will be unable to generate adequate product revenue or achieve and maintain profitability;
•
the outcome, timing and costs of expanding the commercialization of TAVNEOS outside of its current markets and indications and risks if
ChemoCentryx is unable to maintain an effective sales and marketing and distribution capability to maximize its potential across a range of
markets and indications;
•
the risks inherent in obtaining regulatory approvals from government payors and adequate reimbursement from regulatory authorities and
other third party payors to be able to sell TAVNEOS and our drug product candidates;
•
risks and potential delays relating to the manufacturing and supply of TAVNEOS and ChemoCentryx’s drug product candidates, including
due to the failure of third party manufacturers to comply with manufacturing regulations;
•
risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants, and the potential impact of such risks and
uncertainties on a standalone strategy-basis and the trading price of our common stock, including the uncertainty related to the spread of
the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential consequences of the pandemic on the financial markets and ChemoCentryx’s current and future
business and operations, which could include: delays of ChemoCentryx’s ongoing and planned clinical trials; decreases and delays in
supplier, vendor and collaboration partner interactions as a result of government and other restrictions; delays in interactions with and
responses from governmental authorities; and disruptions in the operations of clinical research organizations and other third parties upon
whom ChemoCentryx relies; and
•
the current state of the U.S. and global economies, including the recent downward trend in the biopharmaceutical financial markets,
increased volatility resulting from escalating political and global trade tensions, and the current and potential impact in both the near term
and long term on the biopharmaceutical industry and the future commercialization efforts required with respect to ChemoCentryx’s drug
products and drug product candidates that are or become approved for sale, including the numerous risks, costs and uncertainties
associated with research, development and commercialization of ChemoCentryx’s pipeline programs, all of which risks are enhanced by the
COVID-19 pandemic and may remain present following the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board, in consultation with members of ChemoCentryx’s senior management and representatives of
ChemoCentryx’s outside financial and legal advisors, also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors concerning
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (which are not listed in
any relative order of importance):
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Earnings or Growth. The Board considered that the nature of the Merger as a cash transaction
means that, if the Merger is consummated, our stockholders will not participate in future earnings or growth of ChemoCentryx and will not
benefit from any appreciation in the value of ChemoCentryx’s business or the shares of the surviving corporation.
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, might not be
52
Table of Contents
consummated, and that consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions that may not be within our control,
including receipt of the necessary regulatory clearances and approvals and that no Material Adverse Effect with respect to ChemoCentryx
has occurred that is continuing. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations
to consummate the Merger will be satisfied and, as a result, it is possible that the Merger may not be consummated even if the Merger
Agreement is adopted by our stockholders. The Board considered the fact that if the Merger is not consummated (i) we will have incurred
significant transaction and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to our operations, diversion of management and
employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our business and customer relationships, (ii) the trading price of
our common stock may be adversely affected, and (iii) the market’s perceptions of our prospects could be adversely affected.
•
Interim Operating Covenants. The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business during the pendency of the Merger,
which may delay or prevent ChemoCentryx from undertaking potential business opportunities that may arise, may have a material adverse
effect on our ability to respond to changing market and business conditions in a timely manner (or at all), or may negatively affect our ability
to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. The Board also considered that the focus and resources of ChemoCentryx’s management may
become diverted from other important business opportunities and operational matters while working to consummate the Merger, which
could adversely affect our business.
•
No Solicitation Covenants and Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that, subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement
precludes ChemoCentryx and its representatives from soliciting, or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations relating to,
alternative acquisition proposals, and requires ChemoCentryx to pay to Amgen a termination fee of approximately $119.3 million if the
Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including a termination of the Merger Agreement by ChemoCentryx to enter
into a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal, as described in “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee; Certain Expenses”
beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement. The Board also considered, but did not consider preclusive, the fact that the right afforded
to Amgen under the Merger Agreement to propose amendments or modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in
response to a Superior Proposal may discourage other parties that might otherwise have an interest in a business combination with, or an
acquisition of, ChemoCentryx. The Board also considered that the amount of the termination fee, as compared to termination fees in
transactions of a similar size, in the opinion of the Board, was reasonable, would not likely deter competing bids. The Board also recognized
that the provisions in the Merger Agreement relating to non-solicitation and the termination fee were required by Amgen as conditions to
entering into the Merger Agreement.
•
Effect of Transaction Announcement. The Board considered the potential effect of the announcement of the Merger Agreement, including
effects on our stock price and operations, including our relationships with suppliers, distributors, vendors, collaborators and employees,
and our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well
as the possibility of a suit, action or proceeding in respect of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.
•
Transaction Costs. The Board considered the fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and
expenses in connection with the Merger, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.
•
Taxable Transaction. The Board considered that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to our stockholders that are
treated as U.S. Holders for United States federal income tax purposes.
•
Interests of Directors and Executive Officers. The Board considered the possibility that ChemoCentryx’s directors and executive officers
may have interests in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, those of
ChemoCentryx’s stockholders generally. See “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of ChemoCentryx in the
Merger” beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement.

After considering the foregoing potentially negative factors, the Board concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger substantially
outweighed the risks or potential negative consequences.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive, but includes the
material reasons and factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions and recommendation in relation to the Merger, the Merger Agreement
and the transactions proposed thereby. In light of the variety of reasons and factors considered and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not
find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons or factors considered in reaching their
determinations and recommendations. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including thorough discussions
with, and questioning of, members of our senior management and representatives of our outside financial advisor and legal counsel. Individual directors
may have given differing weights to different factors or may have had different reasons for their ultimate determination. In addition, the Board did not
reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered. Instead, the Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors
and reasons described above and determined in its business judgment that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits of the Merger to the stockholders of
ChemoCentryx outweighed the risks or potential negative consequences. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Board and
certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 33 of this proxy statement.",57,63

Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of August 3, 2022 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth
therein, the $52.00 in cash per share of ChemoCentryx common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates) of such shares
pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 3, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs
provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The
Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of ChemoCentryx’s common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any
other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:
•
the Merger Agreement;
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of ChemoCentryx for the five years ended December 31, 2021;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of ChemoCentryx;
•
certain other communications from ChemoCentryx to its stockholders;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for ChemoCentryx; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for ChemoCentryx, including assumed probabilities associated with certain future events
contemplated by such forecasts and certain analyses related to the expected utilization by ChemoCentryx of certain net operating loss
carryforwards, each as prepared by the management of ChemoCentryx and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by ChemoCentryx, as
described and summarized under “The Merger—Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” (together, the “Financial
Information”).
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of ChemoCentryx regarding their assessment of the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of
54Table of Contents
ChemoCentryx; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for ChemoCentryx’s common stock; compared certain financial and stock market
information for ChemoCentryx with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms
of certain recent business combinations in the biopharmaceutical industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and
considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with ChemoCentryx’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of
all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with ChemoCentryx’s consent, that the Financial Information
was reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of ChemoCentryx. Goldman Sachs did
not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and
liabilities) of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs
assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any
adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the Merger will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in
any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of ChemoCentryx to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the
Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to ChemoCentryx; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting
matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $52.00 in cash per share of
ChemoCentryx’s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any
term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger,
including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of ChemoCentryx; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers,
directors or employees of ChemoCentryx, or class of such persons in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $52.00 in cash per share of
ChemoCentryx’s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates) of shares of ChemoCentryx’s common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and
the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion, and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its
opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any
opinion as to the prices at which shares of ChemoCentryx’s common stock will trade at any time, or as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit,
financial and stock markets on ChemoCentryx, Amgen or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of ChemoCentryx or
Amgen or the ability of ChemoCentryx or Amgen to pay their respective obligations when they become due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a
fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board in connection with rendering the opinion
described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs,
nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of
the financial analyses may include information presented in tabular format. Any such tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and
are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent
that it is based
55
Table of Contents
on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 2, 2022, the last trading day before the date of Goldman Sachs’ opinion, and is
not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices and volumes for the shares of ChemoCentryx’s common
stock for the one-year period ended August 2, 2022. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders (other than Amgen and
its affiliates) of shares of ChemoCentryx’s common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to the (i) the closing price per share of
ChemoCentryx’s common stock on August 2, 2022, the last trading day before the date of Goldman Sachs’ opinion, (ii) the high closing price per share of
ChemoCentryx’s common stock for the 52-week period ended August 2, 2022, and (iii) the volume weighted average price (the “VWAP”) per share of
ChemoCentryx’s common stock for the preceding thirty-, sixty- and ninety-calendar day periods ended August 2, 2022.
This analysis indicated that the price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock to be paid to holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates) of
shares of ChemoCentryx’s common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement represented:
•
a premium of approximately 123% based on the closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock of $23.27 on August 2, 2022, the
last trading day before the date of Goldman Sachs’ opinion;
•
a premium of approximately 28% based on the highest closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock of $40.50 for the 52-week
period ended August 2, 2022;
•
a premium of approximately 118% based on the VWAP per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock of $23.84 for the thirty-calendar day
period ended August 2, 2022;
•
a premium of approximately 113% based on the VWAP per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock of $24.47 for the sixty-calendar day
period ended August 2, 2022; and
•
a premium of approximately 138% based on the VWAP per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock of $21.81 for the ninety-calendar day
period ended August 2, 2022.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis—TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows. Using the Financial Information, Goldman Sachs performed an
illustrative discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the estimated present value of ChemoCentryx based on estimates of unlevered free cash flows for
the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and years 2023 through 2044 to be derived from the commercialization of TAVNEOS for its indication in ANCA-
associated vasculitis, as reflected in the Financial Information (such standalone unlevered free cash flows referred to as the “TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash
Flows”). Using a mid-year convention and discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting estimates of ChemoCentryx’s weighted average cost of
capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal
values for ChemoCentryx based on the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from
negative 20% to 0% to a terminal year estimate of the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows, as reflected in the Financial Information. In addition, using
discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting estimates of ChemoCentryx’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to
present value as of June 30, 2022 the estimated benefits of ChemoCentryx’s net operating losses (“NOLs”) for the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and
years 2023 through 2044, as reflected in the Financial Information. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing
Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including ChemoCentryx’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax
yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for ChemoCentryx, as well as certain financial metrics for the
United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and
experience, taking into account the Financial Information and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product, and
inflation. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for ChemoCentryx based on the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows by adding the
ranges of the present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then added to such ranges of illustrative enterprise values it derived for ChemoCentryx
based on the
56
Table of Contents
TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows the net cash balance of $322.0 million as of June 30, 2022 of ChemoCentryx and the net present value of $200.0 million in
financing expected at the end of 2022 as reflected in the Financial Information, in each case, as provided by the management of ChemoCentryx, to derive a
range of illustrative equity values for ChemoCentryx based on the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative
equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx as of August 2, 2022, as provided by the management of
ChemoCentryx, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share ranging from $41.01 to $45.91.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis—Aggregate Cash Flows. Using the Financial Information, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative
discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the estimated present value of ChemoCentryx based on (A) the TAVNEOS AAV Only Cash Flows and (B)
estimates of the unlevered free cash flows for the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and years 2023 through 2044 to be derived from the commercialization
of TAVNEOS for indications other than ANCA-associated vasculitis and the Company’s CCX559 and CCX507 pipeline drug candidates, as reflected in
the Financial Information (the cash flows described in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Aggregate Cash Flows”).
Using discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting estimates of ChemoCentryx’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs
discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) the Aggregate Cash Flows and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for ChemoCentryx based on
the Aggregate Cash Flows, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from negative 20% to 0% to a terminal year estimate of the
Aggregate Cash Flows, as reflected in the Financial Information. In addition, using a mid-year convention and discount rates ranging from 11.5% to
13.5%, reflecting estimates of ChemoCentryx’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 the
estimated benefits of ChemoCentryx’s NOLs for the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and years 2023 through 2044, as reflected in the Financial
Information. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific
inputs, including ChemoCentryx’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future
applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for ChemoCentryx, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The
range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Financial
Information and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product, and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of
illustrative enterprise values for ChemoCentryx based on the Aggregate Cash Flows by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman
Sachs then added to the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for ChemoCentryx based on the Aggregate Cash Flows the net cash balance of
$322.0 million as of June 30, 2022 of ChemoCentryx and the net present value of the $200.0 million in financing expected at the end of 2022 as reflected in
the Financial Information, in each case, as provided by the management of ChemoCentryx, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for
ChemoCentryx based on the Aggregate Cash Flows. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully
diluted outstanding shares of ChemoCentryx as of August 2, 2022, as provided by the management of ChemoCentryx, using the treasury stock method, to
derive a range of illustrative present values per share ranging from $51.80 to $59.60.
Premia Analysis—Undisturbed Closing Stock Price. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition
premia for transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2015 through August 2, 2022 involving a public company in the
biopharmaceutical industry as the target where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was between $3.0 billion and $8.0 billion. For the same
transactions, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in
such transactions relative to the applicable target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the applicable transaction. This
analysis indicated a median premium of 62% across such transactions. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 47% and 75th percentile
premium of 92% across such transactions. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 47% to 92% to the
undisturbed closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock of $23.27 as of August 2, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per
share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock of $34.21 to $44.68.

Premia Analysis—52-Week High Closing Stock Price. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition
premia for transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2015 through August 2, 2022 involving a public company in the
biopharmaceutical industry as the target where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was between $3.0 billion and $8.0 billion. For the same
transactions, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the average, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in
such transactions relative to the applicable target’s last undisturbed 52-week high closing stock prices prior to announcement of the applicable
transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 21% across such transactions. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of
negative 1% and 75th percentile premium of 31% across such transactions. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative
premiums of negative 1% to 31% to the October 11, 2021, $40.50 per share closing price of ChemoCentryx’s common stock, which is the undisturbed 52-
week high closing price per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock for the 52-week period ended August 2, 2022, and calculated a range of implied
equity values per share of ChemoCentryx’s common stock of $40.10 to $53.06.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to ChemoCentryx or the Merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Board as to the fairness from a financial point
of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $52.00 in cash per share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Amgen and its affiliates)
of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being
based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of ChemoCentryx, Amgen, Goldman Sachs or
any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between ChemoCentryx and Amgen and was approved by the Board.
Goldman Sachs provided advice to ChemoCentryx during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of
consideration to ChemoCentryx or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger,”
Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in making its determination to approve the Merger
Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the
fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment
management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and
employees, and funds or other entities they
58
Table of Contents
manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short
positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of
ChemoCentryx, Amgen, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to ChemoCentryx in connection with, and participated in certain
negotiations leading to, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. During the two-year period ended August 3, 2022,
the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by ChemoCentryx or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting
services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to
Amgen and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having
acted as financial advisor to Amgen in connection with its acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics in April 2021; as bookrunner in connection with the
public offering by Amgen of its 1.650% Senior Notes due 2028 (aggregate principal amount $1,250,000,000), 2.000% Senior Notes due 2032 (aggregate
principal amount $1,250,000,000), 2.800% Senior Notes due 2041 (aggregate principal amount $1,150,000,000), and 3.000% Senior Notes due 2052
(aggregate principal amount $1,350,000,000) in August 2021; as financial advisor to Amgen in connection with its acquisition of Teneobio, Inc. in October
2021; and as bookrunner in connection with the public offering by Amgen of its 3.000% Senior Notes due 2029 (aggregate principal amount $750,000,000),
3.350% Senior Notes due 2032 (aggregate principal amount $1,000,000,000), 4.200% Senior Notes due 2052 (aggregate principal amount $1,000,000,000),
and 4.400% Senior Notes due 2062 (aggregate principal amount $1,250,000,000) in February 2022. During the two-year period ended August 3, 2022,
Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Amgen
and/or its affiliates of approximately $23.0 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to
ChemoCentryx, Amgen, and their respective affiliates for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.
The Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 28, 2022, ChemoCentryx engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its
financial advisor in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between ChemoCentryx and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is
estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the announcement of ChemoCentryx’s entry into the Merger Agreement, to be
approximately $40.0 million, payable upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, ChemoCentryx has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for
certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
We do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty,
unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, ChemoCentryx’s management regularly prepares and reviews
with the Board estimates regarding the success and timing of the development of, regulatory filings and approvals for and the commercialization of our
products and product candidates, as well as various partnership scenarios for the development and commercialization of our product candidates outside
of the United States. In connection with our strategic planning process and the Board’s evaluation of the Merger, as described further in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Background of the Merger,” ChemoCentryx’s management prepared and reviewed with the Board certain
unaudited prospective financial information of ChemoCentryx as an independent company for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and for fiscal
years 2023 through 2044, as prepared and used as described below (referred to as the “Unaudited Prospective Financial Information)”.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided to the Board
for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the Merger.
59
Table of Contents
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was also provided to, and approved by ChemoCentryx for use by, Goldman Sachs, ChemoCentryx’s
financial advisor, for the purposes of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses and fairness opinion in connection with the Merger (as described in more detail
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC”). The Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information includes estimates of ChemoCentryx’s financial performance on a probability-adjusted basis. With ChemoCentryx’s consent, Goldman Sachs
assumed that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then available estimates and
judgments of our management as to our future financial performance, and relied on ChemoCentryx’s assessments as to the validity of, and risks
associated with, our products and product candidates.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed based on ChemoCentryx’s management’s knowledge of and assumptions with
respect to ChemoCentryx’s business, including with respect to the commercialization of TAVNEOS for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis and
in other indications and ChemoCentryx’s CCX559 and CCX507 pipeline drug candidates. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed
without giving effect to the Merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, the expenses that have
already or may be incurred in connection with completing the Merger or any changes to ChemoCentryx’s operations or strategy that may be implemented
during the pendency of or following the consummation of the Merger. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also does not consider the effect
of any failure of the Merger to be completed; it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as “GAAP”). In addition, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared
with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to
prospective financial information. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have (1) compiled,
reviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, (2) expressed any opinion or
any other form of assurance on such information or the achievability of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information or (3) assumed any
responsibility for the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.
Because the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as
well as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also covers
multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
is not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not fact
and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results.
Although the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates
as to future events. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to achieve our goals for the
development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates, including on the timeline assumed for purposes of the
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects assumptions and uncertainties that are subject to
change. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information not to be achieved are described in
various risk factors described in the sections of this proxy statement captioned “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and in
our other filings with the SEC, including those listed under the section captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.” All of these factors are
difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,
whether or not the Merger is consummated. The Unaudited
60
Table of Contents
Prospective Financial Information also reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. The Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and does not consider any events or circumstances after the date that it
was prepared, including the announcement of the entry into the Merger Agreement. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information has not been
updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date it was prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. Except to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information to reflect
circumstances existing after the date that such information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events. ChemoCentryx has or may report
results of operations for periods included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information that were or will be completed following the preparation of
the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to ChemoCentryx’s periodic filings with the SEC for
information on ChemoCentryx’s actual historical results.
Certain of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information are “non-GAAP financial measures.” These are
financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a
substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are
limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.
In certain circumstances, including those applicable to the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, financial measures included in forecasts
provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination transaction are excluded from the definition of “non-
GAAP financial measures” under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not subject to SEC
rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP
financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Board or Goldman Sachs. Accordingly, no
reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is provided in this proxy statement.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. By including the Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information in this proxy statement, neither we nor any of our representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding our ultimate
performance as compared to the information contained in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, ChemoCentryx or any other person considered, or now considers, the
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information to be predictive of actual future results. Further, the inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by ChemoCentryx that the information presented is material. The
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is included in this proxy statement solely to give our stockholders access to the information that was
provided to the Board and Goldman Sachs. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence
any ChemoCentryx stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with
respect to their shares.
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
Various judgments and assumptions were made when preparing the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, including, among others (1)
revenue estimates in the United States based on various assumptions, including with respect to addressable patient population, market penetration, time
to peak sales, peak sales, probability of success as a function of clinical development stage, inflationary factors and pricing and exclusivity, and potential
outcomes with respect thereto for the commercialization of TAVNEOS (including in indications other than ANCA-associated vasculitis) and
ChemoCentryx’s CCX559 and CCX507 pipeline drug candidates, (2) the entry into partnerships for the development and commercialization of certain
product candidates outside of the United States with various upfront, milestone and royalty payments assumptions,
61
Table of Contents
(3) assumptions with respect to cost of goods sold and sales and marketing expenses, certain of such assumptions estimated on a product-by-product
basis, (4) estimated royalty and milestone expenses payable by and to ChemoCentryx based on the terms of ChemoCentryx’s existing partner
relationships, (5) variable research and development expenses estimated based on the phase of each product’s development and launch, (6) estimated
benefits of ChemoCentryx’s NOLs and the assumed completion of an equity financing in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 resulting in net proceeds to
ChemoCentryx of $200 million, and (7) corporate general and administrative expenses generally estimated to grow until TAVNEOS’s loss of exclusivity.
The following table presents estimates of net revenue and EBIT with respect to the commercialization of TAVNEOS (including in indications other than
ANCA-associated vasculitis) and ChemoCentryx’s CCX559 and CCX507 pipeline drug candidates for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and
for fiscal years 2023 through 2044, as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, as well as estimates of unlevered free cash flow with
respect to the commercialization of TAVNEOS (including in indications other than ANCA-associated vasculitis) and ChemoCentryx’s CCX559 and
CCX507 pipeline drug candidates for the same period, as approved by ChemoCentryx.

Members of the Board and ChemoCentryx’s executive officers may have various interests in the Merger that may be in addition to, or different from,
the interests of ChemoCentryx stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of these potential interests and considered them at the time
they approved the Merger Agreement and in making their recommendation that ChemoCentryx stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These
potential interests are described below.
62Table of Contents
Treatment of Equity Awards
Each of our directors and executive officers hold outstanding ChemoCentryx equity awards. The ChemoCentryx equity awards held by our
directors and executive officers immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated in the Merger in the same manner as ChemoCentryx equity awards
held by employees generally. At the Effective Time, outstanding ChemoCentryx equity awards held by our directors and executive officers will be treated
as follows:
•
Each ChemoCentryx stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock underlying such stock option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share
exercise price of such ChemoCentryx stock option. Any ChemoCentryx stock options, whether vested or unvested, with a per share exercise
price equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration will be cancelled for no consideration as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
•
Each RSU that was granted prior to August 3, 2022 or to a non-employee member of the Board and that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock subject to such RSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration;
•
Each RSU that was granted on or after August 3, 2022 (other than to a non-employee member of the Board) and that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into an Amgen Cash Award, representing the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock subject to such RSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger
Consideration, which will vest and become payable at the same time as such RSU would have vested and been payable pursuant to its
terms, subject to continued employment. Each Amgen Cash Award will provide for accelerated vesting upon the executive officer’s death,
disability or if the executive officer’s employment is terminated under circumstances that would give rise to severance under his or her
employment agreement, as described below under “—Change in Control Severance Benefits in Executive Officer Employment
Arrangements”, subject to such executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in the form attached to the
employment agreement; and
•
Each restricted stock award that was granted prior to August 3, 2022 or to a non-employee member of the Board and is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration.

Table of Contents
The following table sets forth, for each of ChemoCentryx’s directors and executive officers, (i) the number and value of shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock subject to vested ChemoCentryx stock options, (ii) the number and value of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock subject to unvested
ChemoCentryx stock options, (iii) the number and value of unvested RSUs and restricted stock awards and (iv) the total value of shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock subject to ChemoCentryx stock options, unvested RSUs and unvested restricted stock awards, in each case, held by such director or
executive officer as of September 13, 2022. As of September 13, 2022, none of our directors or executive officers held any RSUs that would be converted
into Amgen Cash Awards at the Effective Time. These amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional equity award grants, issuances or forfeitures
that may occur prior to the Effective Time following the date of this proxy statement. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not
actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, the actual amounts to be received by ChemoCentryx’s directors and executive officers may materially
differ from the amounts set forth below. This table also does not include any outstanding rights to purchase shares under the ESPP held by our executive
officers or any outstanding stock options the exercise price of which is in excess of $52.00 per share and which will be cancelled for no consideration at
the Effective Time. For additional information regarding the ESPP, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP” beginning on
page 79 of this proxy statement.

Change in Control Severance Benefits in Executive Officer Employment Arrangements
Each of ChemoCentryx’s executive officers has entered into an employment agreement with ChemoCentryx, pursuant to which the executive officer
is entitled to severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment, including after a change in control (which will include the Merger).
Employment Agreements with Dr. Schall, Ms. Kanaya and Dr. Cappel
ChemoCentryx has entered into employment agreements with each of Dr. Schall, Ms. Kanaya and Dr. Cappel. Under each of the employment
agreements, if ChemoCentryx terminates an executive officer’s employment without “cause” or if the executive officer resigns for “good reason”, in each
case within 12 months following a change in control, subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, such executive officer will be
entitled to receive: (1) a lump sum cash payment equal to the executive officer’s monthly base salary as in effect immediately prior to the involuntary
termination for the 18 month period following the date of termination or resignation, (2) a lump sum cash payment equal to one and one-half times the
executive officer’s target bonus for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurred, (3) until the date that is 18 months following the date of
termination (or, if earlier, the date on which the applicable continuation period under COBRA ends), reimbursement of the costs associated with
continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA for the executive officer and his or her eligible dependents covered under ChemoCentryx’s health plans as of
the date of termination, such that the executive officer’s premiums are the same as for active employees, and (4) accelerated vesting of all of the executive
officer’s outstanding stock awards upon the date of effectiveness of the release. The foregoing change-in-control severance benefits will only apply so
long as the executive officer is working on a full-time basis.
For purposes of the employment agreements, “cause” means an executive officer (1) has committed an act of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty in
connection with the executive officer’s employment, or has intentionally committed some other illegal act that has, or may be reasonably expected to
have, a material adverse impact on the company or any successor or parent or subsidiary thereof; (2) has been convicted of, or entered a plea of “guilty”
or “no contest” to, a felony, or to any crime involving moral turpitude, which causes or may reasonably be expected to cause substantial economic injury
to or substantial injury to the reputation of ChemoCentryx or any successor or parent or subsidiary thereof; (3) has made any unauthorized use or
disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets of ChemoCentryx or any successor or parent or subsidiary thereof that has, or may reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse impact on any such entity; (4) has materially breached a ChemoCentryx policy, materially breached the provisions of
the executive officer’s employment agreement, or has committed any other intentional misconduct that has, or may be reasonably expected to have, a
material adverse impact on ChemoCentryx or any successor or parent or subsidiary thereof; or (5) has intentionally refused or intentionally failed to act in
accordance with any lawful and proper direction or order of the board of directors or the appropriate individual to whom the executive officer reports;
provided such direction is not materially inconsistent with the executive officer’s customary duties and responsibilities.
For purposes of the employment agreements, “good reason” means (1) a material diminution in the executive officer’s authority, duties or
responsibilities, (2) a material diminution in the authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the named executive officer is required to
report, (3) a material diminution in the executive officer’s base compensation unless such a reduction is imposed across-the-board to senior management
of the company, (4) a material change in the geographic location at which the executive officer must perform his or her duties, or (5) any other action or
inaction that constitutes a material breach by the company or any successor or affiliate of its obligations to the executive officer under the employment
agreement.
Employment Agreements with Mr. Butt and Dr. Jain
ChemoCentryx has entered into employment agreements with each of Mr. Butt and Dr. Jain, each of which provides that if ChemoCentryx terminates
the executive officer’s employment without “cause” or if the executive
65
Table of Contents
officer resigns for “good reason”, in each case within 12 months following a change in control, subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release
of claims, such executive officer will be entitled to receive: (1) a lump sum cash payment equal to 12 months of the executive officer’s current base salary,
(2) a lump sum cash payment equal to the executive officer’s target bonus for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurred, (3) if the executive
officer timely elects continued coverage under COBRA, payment of COBRA premiums for health insurance coverage until the earliest of (A) the close of
the 12 month period following the termination of the executive officer’s employment, (B) expiration of the executive officer’s eligibility for COBRA
continuation coverage, or (C) the date on which the executive officer becomes eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in
connection with new employment or self-employment, and (4) accelerated vesting of the service-based vesting requirements of the executive officer’s
outstanding equity awards as of the date of termination (with any performance-based equity awards treated in accordance with their terms).
For purposes of the employment agreements with Mr. Butt and Dr. Jain, “cause” and “good reason” generally have the meanings given to such
terms in the employment agreements with the other executive officers described above.
For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of ChemoCentryx’s named executive officers upon a qualifying termination at the
Effective Time of the Merger under their employment agreements, see “Proposal No. 2: Advisory Vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal—The
Merger Compensation Proposal—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to ChemoCentryx’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page
105 of this proxy statement.
ChemoCentryx Annual Bonus Plan
If the Closing Date occurs before annual bonuses for fiscal year 2022 are paid, Amgen will, or will cause the surviving corporation to, pay each
eligible executive officer the amounts payable to such executive officer under ChemoCentryx’s annual bonus plan (A) if the Closing Date occurs prior to
December 31, 2022, based on the target level of performance, or (B) if the Closing Date occurs on or after January 1, 2023, based on the actual level of
performance and individual earned bonus amounts as determined by ChemoCentryx no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time. If an executive
officer is terminated prior to the payment of his or her fiscal year 2022 bonus under the circumstances that would give rise to severance under such
executive officer’s employment agreement, then subject to such executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in the same form
to be executed under his or her employment agreement, such executive officer will remain entitled to receive such fiscal year 2022 bonus, prorated for the
portion of fiscal year 2022 elapsed prior to the date of termination if such termination occurs prior to December 31, 2022. The payment of any such
prorated bonus is in addition to the severance under his or her employment agreement, as described above.
For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of ChemoCentryx’s named executive officers upon a qualifying termination at the
effective time of the Merger under ChemoCentryx’s annual bonus plan, see “Proposal No. 2: Advisory Vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal—The
Merger Compensation Proposal—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to ChemoCentryx’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page
105 of this proxy statement.
New Amgen Arrangements
Certain of ChemoCentryx’s executive officers may continue to provide employment or other services to Amgen after the Effective Time and may
enter into new agreements, arrangements or understandings with Amgen to set forth the terms and compensation of such post-Closing service. As of the
date of this proxy statement, no such agreements, arrangements or understandings with Amgen exist.
66
Table of Contents
Tax Planning Strategies
Under the Merger Agreement, if the Closing Date is not reasonably expected to occur in 2022, ChemoCentryx may implement tax planning strategies
for the purpose of mitigating the impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code on ChemoCentryx’s executive officers and preserve certain compensation-
related tax deductions that might otherwise be disallowed. Such tax planning strategies will not include a gross-up of any excise taxes under Section 4999
of the Code, but may include vesting certain equity awards in the second half of December 2022 that are scheduled to vest in early 2023 or paying 2022
bonuses (or a portion thereof) in the second half of December 2022. In addition, ChemoCentryx is permitted to enter into amendments to the employment
agreements with each of Dr. Schall, Ms. Kanaya and Dr. Cappel to implement a standard “better-net” cutback with respect to Sections 280G and 4999 of
the Code. As of the date of this proxy statement, no such tax planning strategies or amendments have been finalized or implemented.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance
Under the Merger Agreement, from and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
Amgen will cause the surviving corporation, among other things, to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former (as of August 3, 2022) director
or officer of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries in their capacities as such against any losses incurred by such indemnified person in respect of any
pending or threatened litigation, action, suit, claim, demand or proceeding based upon or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such indemnified
person was a director or officer of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending,
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and any other applicable law, the certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of ChemoCentryx and its subsidiaries in effect on August 3, 2022, and Amgen will cause the
surviving corporation to observe the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions in favor of ChemoCentryx’s present and
former directors and officers (as of August 3, 2022) as set forth the certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of ChemoCentryx and its subsidiaries in effect on August 3, 2022, and the terms of certain indemnification agreements between
ChemoCentryx and its officers and directors.
In addition, prior to the Effective Time Amgen will, or will cause the surviving corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium (subject to
limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement) for the non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of ChemoCentryx’s
existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies for a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect

The Merger Agreement is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Amgen. We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to
consummate the Merger and the related transactions, not including fees and expenses, will be approximately $4.0 billion, including the estimated funds
needed to (i) pay our stockholders the Merger Consideration due to them under the Merger Agreement and (ii) make payments in respect of outstanding
equity awards of ChemoCentryx pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
We understand that Amgen expects to fund amounts needed for the acquisition of ChemoCentryx under the Merger Agreement through the use of
cash on hand.

ChemoCentryx has agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
representatives to, provide all cooperation that is necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably requested by Amgen to assist Amgen in the
arrangement of any third-party debt or equity financing for the purpose of financing the aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing
of debt contemplated by the Merger Agreement or required or undertaken in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement

cooperate with Amgen and take all other actions to facilitate the termination at the closing of all commitments in respect of its existing credit agreement
(as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—Financing Covenants”), the
repayment in full on the Closing Date of all obligations in respect of the indebtedness under its existing credit agreement, and the release on the Closing

Unless another date is agreed by the parties, the closing of the Merger will take place as soon as practicable (but in any event no later than the
third business day) after the date the conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at such time) have been
satisfied or (to the extent permissible) waived in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
At the closing of the Merger, ChemoCentryx and Merger Sub will cause to be filed a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL and will make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection
with the Merger. The Merger will become effective at such time as such certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (or at such later date and time as specified in the certificate of merger).
Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for
the fair value of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The
“fair value” of your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as,
the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This
proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock
following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value
of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration
they would otherwise
68Table of Contents
be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply
strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of
the complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors
before attempting to exercise such rights.
A copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires to
exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting
to exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that persons seek to
exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
under the Merger Agreement.
A holder of record of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares through the Effective
Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies
with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of a
beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (B)
provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct
copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by ChemoCentryx and to be
set forth on the Chancery List (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of ChemoCentryx common stock
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
Section 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the stockholders be notified that
appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20) days before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of
Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without
subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes ChemoCentryx’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with
the Merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the
text of Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the
loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.
If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: you must
deliver to ChemoCentryx a written demand for appraisal of your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock prior to the Special Meeting, which must
reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock who intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its
shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and, for beneficial owners only, such demand is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial
owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an
address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by ChemoCentryx and to be set forth on the Chancery List; you must not vote
or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; you must hold your shares of ChemoCentryx common stock continuously
through the effective date; and you must comply with the other applicable requirements of Section 262.

Table of Contents
A ChemoCentryx stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail or deliver his, her or its written demand for appraisal to the following
address:
ChemoCentryx, Inc.
835 Industrial Road, Suite 600
San Carlos, CA 94070
Attention: Corporate Secretary
A record holder who holds shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other
nominee, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the
record owner. In such case, the demand must set forth the number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock covered by such demand. Where the
number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of ChemoCentryx common
stock outstanding in the name of such record owner.
Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the Merger has become effective to each (a)
ChemoCentryx stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and (b) any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any
person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and accept the Merger
Consideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person’s shares of ChemoCentryx common stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a
written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective
Time will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the person within sixty (60) days after the
effective date, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, with such approval conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. If the surviving corporation does not
approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the
dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the person will be entitled to receive only the fair value of such person’s shares of ChemoCentryx common stock
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Merger
Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation and any person who has properly and
timely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of the
shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of ChemoCentryx or the
surviving corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should assume that ChemoCentryx and the surviving
corporation will not file such a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock. Accordingly,
persons who desire to have their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their
appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, no
petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only
to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.
In addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions
of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock not consented in writing or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were
received by the surviving corporation and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such
70
Table of Contents
statement must be mailed within ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation or within ten (10) days
after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.
Upon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving
corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and
with whom the surviving corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (referred to as the “Chancery List”). The Register in
Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or
certified mail to the surviving corporation and to all such person set forth on the Chancery List.
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which
persons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the
persons who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their
certificates of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and
if any person fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the Delaware Court of Chancery
may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name
appears on the Chancery List and may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262.
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court of Chancery shall determine the fair
value of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound
quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the
entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest
shall accrue after such payment only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the surviving corporation as part of
the pre-judgment payment to the person.
When the fair value of the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such
value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.
Although ChemoCentryx believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and persons should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or
lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the Merger
Consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the
“fair value” of the relevant shares of ChemoCentryx common stock is less than the Merger Consideration.
71
Table of Contents
In determining “fair value”, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value
by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court
has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of
the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of
the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass
known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, the Delaware courts have
decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting person’s exclusive remedy.
The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys’ and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her
or its attorneys’ and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the
proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of ChemoCentryx common stock
entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such and award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under
Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware Court of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
Any person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or
distributions payable to ChemoCentryx stockholders of record at a date prior to the Effective Time.
To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the other hand, Section 262 will
govern.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights.

The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to holders of
shares of ChemoCentryx common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions,
published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (referred to as the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy
statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to
holders that hold their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property
held for investment purposes). This summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a complete description of all potential U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the Merger. This summary does not describe any of the tax
72Table of Contents
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than
income taxation (e.g., state, gift or alternative minimum tax, the Medicare net investment income surtax, or any withholding considerations under the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including regulations issued thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto
or in connection therewith)). In addition, this summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares that exercise
appraisal rights under the DGCL. For purposes of this discussion, a “holder” means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder or both, as the context may
require.
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to
holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to:
•
holders that may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations,
governmental organizations, S corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as pass-through entities or
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any investor therein, insurance companies, mutual funds, brokers or dealers in stocks,
securities, commodities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies”
or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
holders holding their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock as part of a hedging, straddle or other risk reducing transaction or as part of a
conversion transaction or other integrated investment;
•
holders deemed to sell their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;
•
holders that received their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in compensatory transactions;
•
holders that hold their shares of ChemoCentryx common stock through individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts;
•
holders that own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Amgen or the surviving corporation;
•
U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or
•
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of ChemoCentryx common stock (by vote or value).
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares
of ChemoCentryx common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and partners therein should consult their tax
advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the
following summary. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any
challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.
THIS DISCUSSION OF MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY
AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY
CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR OTHER TAX LAWS.
73
Table of Contents
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this proxy statement, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock who or that is for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:
•
An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or
the District of Columbia;
•
An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
A trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons
as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a
United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash
received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of ChemoCentryx common stock. Any such gain or loss
generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at
the time of the consummation of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gains generally will apply to long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S.
Holders, including individuals. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of ChemoCentryx
common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to
each block of ChemoCentryx common stock.
Payments made to a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information
reporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a rate of 24%. To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. Holders that do not otherwise
establish an exemption should complete and return to the exchange agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal certifying
that such holder is a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such
holder is not subject to backup withholding. Certain types of U.S. Holders (including, with respect to certain types of payments, corporations) generally
are not subject to backup withholding or information reporting rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from cash payments to a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger under the backup
withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this proxy statement, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock that is
neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax consequences that may be
relevant to them in light of their particular circumstances.
74
Table of Contents
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such
gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate specified under an applicable
tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition, and
certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate
specified under an applicable tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder recognized in the same
taxable year (if any); or
•
shares of ChemoCentryx common stock held by such Non-U.S. Holder constitute a United States real property interest by reason of
ChemoCentryx’s status as a “United States real property holding corporation” within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code (a
“USRPHC”), at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time or the period that the Non-U.S.
Holder held the applicable shares of ChemoCentryx common stock. ChemoCentryx believes it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC
during the five-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time.
Payments made to Non-U.S. Holders in exchange for shares of ChemoCentryx common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information
reporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a rate of 24%. Non-U.S. Holders generally can avoid information reporting and backup withholding by
providing the exchange agent with the applicable and properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8 certifying the holder’s non-U.S. status or by
otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an applicable tax treaty or
information exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act
notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. ChemoCentryx and Amgen filed their respective HSR Act notifications on August 17,
2022.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under applicable antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or
hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, and
notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under its applicable antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger or
75Table of Contents
seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under applicable antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.
Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, ChemoCentryx, Amgen and Merger Sub have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
take, and to cause their affiliates to take, all actions and steps requested or required by any governmental authority as a condition to granting any
consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance or approval, and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve objections, if any, of the FTC or DOJ, or other governmental authorities of any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations,
waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, so as to obtain such consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act or other antitrust laws, and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other governmental authorities under antitrust laws,
and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any order in any action or legal proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
the closing of the Merger or delaying the closing of the Merger beyond the End Date. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, such reasonable best efforts
required by the parties and/or their affiliates will include (1) proffering and consenting and/or agreeing to the sale, divestiture, licensing or other
disposition, or the holding separate, of particular assets, categories of assets or portions of any business of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries, (2)
promptly effecting the disposition, licensing or holding separate of particular assets, categories of assets or portions of any business of ChemoCentryx or
any of its subsidiaries and (3) agreeing to such limitations on the conduct or actions with respect to any particular assets, categories of assets or portions
of any business of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, as may be required in order to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date) (the actions referred to
in clauses (1), (2) and (3), referred to as “remedy actions”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the Merger Agreement (i) neither Amgen nor any
of its affiliates is required to proffer, consent to or agree to or effect any remedy action with respect to (A) any assets, categories of assets or portions of
any business of Amgen or any of its subsidiaries (other than solely ChemoCentryx and its subsidiaries, subject to the following clause (B)) or (B) any
assets, categories of assets or portions of any business of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries if, in the case of this clause (B), any such remedy
action would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the business, assets or financial condition of ChemoCentryx and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (ii) ChemoCentryx is only permitted to proffer, consent to or agree to or effect any remedy action with the prior
written consent of Amgen.
Other than the filings required under the HSR Act as described above, we currently do not expect that any clearance, approval or consent would be
required under any other applicable antitrust law in connection with the Merger.

On September 2, 2022, a purported stockholder of ChemoCentryx filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California captioned Meinking v. ChemoCentryx, Inc., Case No. 3:22-cv-05019-LB. The complaint names ChemoCentryx and members of the Board as
defendants and alleges that the defendants made materially incomplete and misleading statements about the proposed acquisition of ChemoCentryx by
Amgen. Specifically, the complaint alleges that all defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and that each Board member violated Section
20(a) of the Exchange Act, and asserts claims challenging the adequacy of disclosures regarding ChemoCentryx’s projections, Goldman’s financial
analyses, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on August 31, 2022 (the
“Preliminary Proxy”). The complaint seeks, among other relief, (i) injunctive relief preventing the parties from proceeding with the Merger until the alleged
disclosure deficiencies have been remedied, (ii) rescission in the event the Merger is consummated or alternatively rescissory damages and (iii) an award
of costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees. ChemoCentryx believes this lawsuit is without merit.

The following summary describes certain material provisions of the Merger Agreement. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by

The Merger Agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the Merger
Agreement. Factual disclosures about ChemoCentryx contained in this proxy statement or in ChemoCentryx’s public reports filed with the SEC may
supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about ChemoCentryx contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary. The
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements made in the Merger Agreement by ChemoCentryx and Amgen were qualified and subject to
important limitations agreed to by ChemoCentryx and Amgen in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In particular, in your
review of the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is important
to bear in mind that the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the
circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the right to not close the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other
party prove to be untrue (or such covenants and agreements were not complied with), due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk
between the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements may
also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the
SEC, and in some cases were qualified by disclosures contained in the disclosure schedules delivered by ChemoCentryx to Amgen in connection with the
Merger Agreement (referred to as the “Disclosure Schedules”), which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information
concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have
changed since August 3, 2022, and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this
proxy statement or in the respective public filings made by each of ChemoCentryx or Amgen with the SEC. For the foregoing reasons, the representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements and any descriptions of those provisions should not be read alone or relied upon as characterizations of the
actual state of facts or condition of ChemoCentryx, Amgen or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Instead, such provisions or descriptions
should be read only in conjunction with the other information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement or incorporated by reference into this proxy

Cancelled Shares, Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and will be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in cash.
At the Effective Time, any Cancelled Shares will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist, and no consideration or payment will be made
with respect thereto. At the Effective Time, each Excluded Share will be converted into a number of shares of the surviving corporation such that the
subsidiary holding such Excluded Share immediately prior to the Effective Time owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the
surviving corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in ChemoCentryx immediately prior to the Effective Time.

readjustment of shares or similar transaction, or any stock dividend with a record date occurring during such period, but excluding any change that
results from any exercise of any ChemoCentryx stock option award outstanding as of August 3, 2022), the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be appropriately adjusted to reflect the effect of such change as set forth in the Merger Agreement in
order to provide Amgen and the holders of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock and ChemoCentryx equity awards the same economic effect for the

Consideration. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each RSU that was granted on or following August 3, 2022 (subject to certain exceptions
specified in the Disclosure Schedules and other than RSUs granted to a non-employee member of the Board) will be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the total number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock subject to such RSU and (2) the

generally subject to continued employment or service.
Restricted Stock Awards. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of ChemoCentryx common stock subject to vesting, repurchase
or other lapse restriction granted under the ChemoCentryx Stock Plan that was (i) granted prior to August 3, 2022 and/or (ii) granted to a non-employee

current offering period, except those made in accordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of August 3, 2022; and (iii) no individuals
will commence participation in the ESPP during the period from August 3, 2022 through the Effective Time. If the Effective Time would occur during the
Final Offering Period, (A) the accumulated contributions of the participants in such offering period will be used to purchase shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock as of such date as ChemoCentryx determines in its sole discretion (provided that such date will be no later than five business days prior to
the Effective Time), (B) the participants’ accumulated contributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase shares of ChemoCentryx common stock in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of the date determined in accordance with the foregoing clause (A), and (C) purchase rights under such offering
will terminate immediately after such purchase. As of no later than the business day immediately prior to the Effective Time, ChemoCentryx will terminate

withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under Section 262, or if a court of competent jurisdiction

evidence of transfer as may reasonably be requested by the exchange agent, the Merger Consideration payable for each share of ChemoCentryx common
stock represented by such Non-DTC Book-Entry Share.
With respect to DTC Book-Entry Shares, ChemoCentryx, Merger Sub and Amgen will cooperate to establish procedures with the exchange agent

cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of shares of ChemoCentryx common stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration that are held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the

pursuant to the Merger Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the exchange agent, the surviving corporation or Amgen, as the case may be, so deducts and

For a period of not less than 12 months after the Effective Time, Amgen or the surviving corporation will provide the employees of ChemoCentryx
or its subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
92
Table of Contents
(referred to as a “covered employee”) during the period they continue to be employed by Amgen, the surviving corporation and/or its or Amgen’s
subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time with:
•
base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term cash incentive compensation targets (including, but not limited to, bonuses
and commissions) each of which is no less favorable than the base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term cash incentive
compensation targets provided to such covered employee immediately prior to August 3, 2022;
•
severance pay and benefits that are no less favorable than the severance pay and benefits provided under ChemoCentryx’s severance plan
and executive employment agreements as in effect on August 3, 2022; and
•
other benefits (excluding severance, equity and long-term incentive compensation) that are, in the aggregate and at a minimum,
substantially equivalent to the benefits (excluding severance, equity and long-term compensation) provided to similarly situated employees
of Amgen or its subsidiaries.
Amgen will provide all covered employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits under any
employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Amgen or the surviving corporation and/or
their subsidiaries in which covered employees are eligible to participate for all periods of employment with ChemoCentryx or its subsidiaries (or any
predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time to the same extent as such covered employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar ChemoCentryx benefit plan in which such covered employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided that the foregoing will not apply (A) under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare plan, (B) for purposes of any
Amgen benefit plan under which similarly situated employees of Amgen and its subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, (C) for purposes of
any Amgen benefit plan that is grandfathered or frozen to new participants, either with respect to level of benefits or participation or (D) to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, Amgen will use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any Amgen benefit plan
to be waived with respect to the covered employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the
applicable covered employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) to the extent not prohibited by the terms, or by any third party
administrator, of any fully insured medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan of Amgen or the surviving corporation, credit each covered
employee with all deductible payments, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such covered employee and his or her covered
dependents under the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of ChemoCentryx prior to the closing of the Merger during the plan year in
which the closing of the Merger occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which such covered employee has satisfied the deductible, co-
payments, or maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such covered employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan year under any
medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan of the surviving corporation, Amgen or its affiliates, as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such plan (to the extent such credit would have been given under comparable ChemoCentryx benefit plans prior to the closing of the
Merger).
If requested by Amgen not less than ten business days before the Closing Date, ChemoCentryx will adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate any benefit plans that are tax-qualified defined contribution plans, effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date.
Efforts to Consummate the Merger

consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, including using reasonable
best efforts to: (i) obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations, approvals and, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods from governmental authorities and make all necessary registrations and filings and take all steps as may be reasonably

to avoid an action or proceeding by, any governmental authority in connection with any antitrust law; (ii) obtain all other approvals, consents,
ratifications, permissions, waivers or authorizations from governmental authorities or other third parties necessary, proper or advisable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided, that, in connection with any of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), ChemoCentryx is
not permitted to agree to (x) make any payment of a consent fee, “profit sharing” payment or other consideration (including increased or accelerated
payment) or concede anything of monetary or economic value or (y) amend, supplement or modify any contract in any manner that would be adverse to
the interest of ChemoCentryx or, after the Merger, Amgen and its subsidiaries, in each case, without the prior written consent of Amgen.
ChemoCentryx, Amgen and Merger Sub are also required to use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly take, and to cause their
affiliates to take, all actions and steps requested or required by any governmental authority as a condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization,
waiver, clearance or approval, and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to resolve objections, if any, of the
FTC or the DOJ, or other governmental authorities of any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals
and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, so as to obtain
such consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or other antitrust laws, and
to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other governmental authorities under antitrust laws, and to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any order in any action or legal proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the closing of the Merger or
delaying the closing of the Merger beyond the End Date. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, such reasonable best efforts required by the parties and/or
their affiliates will include (1) proffering and consenting and/or agreeing to the sale, divestiture, licensing or other disposition, or the holding separate, of
particular assets, categories of assets or portions of any business of ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries, (2) promptly effecting the disposition,

ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, as may be required in order to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date) (the actions referred to in clauses (1), (2) and
(3) referred to as “remedy actions”); provided, however, that (i) neither Amgen nor any of its affiliates is required to proffer, consent to or agree to or
effect any remedy action with respect to (A) any assets, categories of assets or portions of any business of Amgen or any of its subsidiaries (other than
solely ChemoCentryx and its subsidiaries, subject to the following clause (B)) or (B) any assets, categories of assets or portions of any business of
ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries if, in the case of this clause (B), any such remedy action would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the business, assets or financial condition of ChemoCentryx and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and provided, that
ChemoCentryx is only permitted to proffer, consent to or agree to or effect any remedy action with the prior written consent of Amgen.
ChemoCentryx and Amgen were required to, as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) business days following August 3, 2022,

investigation, action or legal proceeding, and (vii) except as may be prohibited by any governmental authority or by applicable law, and subject to certain
exceptions in the Merger Agreement, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding in respect of the transactions

connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance
For six years after the Effective Time, Amgen is required to cause the surviving corporation to (i) observe the obligations of ChemoCentryx and its
subsidiaries under (a) certain indemnification agreements entered into between ChemoCentryx or its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and certain of its
directors and executive officers, on the other hand and (b) the indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions in the certificate of
incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or comparable organizational documents of ChemoCentryx or such subsidiary, in each case, in effect on
August 3, 2022, and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless each present and former (as of August 3, 2022) director and officer of ChemoCentryx or any of its
subsidiaries in their capacities as such against any losses incurred by such person in connection with any pending or threatened litigation, action, suit,
claim, demand or proceeding based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of ChemoCentryx at or
prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and any other applicable law, and the certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of ChemoCentryx and its subsidiaries in effect on August 3, 2022 and not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify such rights in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of such directors and officers thereunder.
Amgen is also required to, or to cause the surviving corporation to, purchase, obtain and fully pay the premium for a non-cancellable extension of
the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of ChemoCentryx’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies with a claims reporting or discovery
period of six years from the Effective Time. In each case, such policies must have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than those contained in ChemoCentryx’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies in effect as of August 3, 2022, with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time. However, in no event will Amgen or the surviving corporation be required to expend for such policies an
aggregate premium
95
Table of Contents
amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium amount currently paid or payable by ChemoCentryx with respect to its existing directors’ and
officers’ insurance policies as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement. If the aggregate premium amount of such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than such amount, the surviving corporation is required to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the surviving corporation is
required to maintain in effect, and Amgen will cause the surviving corporation to maintain in effect, such directors’ and officers’ tail policy.
Financing Covenants
Receipt of Financing
Amgen’s receipt of financing is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger. We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to
consummate the Merger and the related transactions, not including fees and expenses, will be approximately $4.0 billion, including the estimated funds
needed to (i) pay our stockholders the Merger Consideration due to them under the Merger Agreement and (ii) make payments in respect of outstanding
equity awards of ChemoCentryx pursuant to the Merger Agreement. We understand that Amgen expects to fund amounts needed for the acquisition of
ChemoCentryx under the Merger Agreement through the use of cash on hand.
ChemoCentryx has agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
representatives to, provide all cooperation that is necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably requested by Amgen to assist Amgen in the
arrangement of any third-party debt or equity financing for the purpose of financing the aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing
of debt contemplated by the Merger Agreement or required or undertaken in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including
all amounts payable in respect of equity awards of ChemoCentryx under the Merger Agreement) and all related fees and expenses of Amgen and Merger
Sub, subject to certain exceptions described below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, ChemoCentryx does not have to provide any such cooperation to the extent doing so would (i) unreasonably
disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of ChemoCentryx or its subsidiaries, (ii) require ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries to agree to pay
any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time for which it is not promptly
reimbursed or simultaneously indemnified or (iii) require ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of ChemoCentryx (as in effect as of August 3, 2022), any applicable law, that certain credit agreement, dated as of January 8, 2020, by and between
ChemoCentryx, Hercules Capital, Inc. and certain other parties thereto (referred to as the “existing credit agreement”) (as in effect as of August 3, 2022) or
any material contract of ChemoCentryx or its subsidiaries (as in effect as of August 3, 2022).
In addition, Amgen will promptly, upon request by ChemoCentryx, reimburse ChemoCentryx for all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries or their respective representatives at the request of Amgen in connection
with ChemoCentryx’s cooperation with Amgen. Amgen is also required to indemnify and hold harmless ChemoCentryx, its subsidiaries and their
respective representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
the arrangement of any financing by Amgen and any information used in connection therewith, except with respect to any information provided by
ChemoCentryx or any of its subsidiaries or any fraud or intentional misrepresentation or omission, willful misconduct or material breach of the Merger
Agreement by any such persons. Further, Amgen and its subsidiaries are permitted to disclose information about ChemoCentryx and its subsidiaries
(including information otherwise subject to the
96
Table of Contents
terms of the confidentiality agreement between ChemoCentryx and Amgen) as necessary and consistent with customary practices in connection with
Amgen’s efforts to obtain financing and subject to customary confidentiality arrangements in connection therewith.
Existing Credit Agreement
ChemoCentryx has also agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices,
cooperate with Amgen and take all other actions to facilitate the termination at closing of all commitments in respect of the existing credit agreement, the
repayment in full on the Closing Date of all obligations in respect of the indebtedness under the existing credit agreement, and the release on the Closing
Date of any liens securing all such indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith. Additionally, ChemoCentryx has agreed that it and its
subsidiaries will use reasonable best efforts and will cooperate with Amgen to obtain and deliver to Amgen at least two (2) business days prior to the
Closing Date an executed payoff letter with respect to the existing credit agreement, in form and substance customary for transactions of this type, from
the applicable agent on behalf of the persons to whom such indebtedness is owed, subject to Amgen providing all funds required to effect all such
repayments at the closing.

ChemoCentryx must pay to Amgen a termination fee of $119,314,679 (referred to as the “Termination Fee”) in cash in the event that the Merger
Agreement is validly terminated:
•
by Amgen because, prior to obtaining the ChemoCentryx Stockholder Approval, (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred or
(ii) there has been an intentional and material breach of the non-solicitation covenants applicable to ChemoCentryx under the Merger
Agreement;

by ChemoCentryx prior to obtaining ChemoCentryx Stockholder Approval to accept a Superior Proposal and, substantially concurrently
with such termination, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;

termination by ChemoCentryx, to certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement) or (ii) by Amgen because ChemoCentryx breached
or failed to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Merger Agreement and fails to timely cure such
breach or failure, if curable, and in each case:

prior to the date that is twelve (12) months following the date of such termination, ChemoCentryx enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (in either case, whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal referred to above); provided that, for purposes of this provision, each reference to “20%” in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal is a reference to “50%”); and provided further that the Termination Fee payable pursuant to this provision will
be payable by ChemoCentryx only upon consummation of an Acquisition Proposal;
•
by either ChemoCentryx or Amgen because the ChemoCentryx Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Special Meeting at which a vote
on the Merger Proposal is taken and:
•
after August 3, 2022, and prior to such termination, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced and such Acquisition
Proposal is not publicly withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the Special Meeting, and

be payable by ChemoCentryx only upon consummation of an Acquisition Proposal.
Other than in the case of fraud or willful breach, if the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in circumstances in which the Termination Fee is due
and payable, Amgen’s receipt of the Termination Fee (and applicable costs, expenses and interest as set forth in the Merger Agreement and described
below) will be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Amgen, Merger Sub, any of their respective

The Merger Agreement further provides that, other than in the case of fraud or willful breach, Amgen’s right to receive payment from
ChemoCentryx of the Termination Fee (and applicable costs, expenses and interest as set forth in the Merger Agreement and described below) is the sole

As described under “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement, after
considering various factors described in such section, the Board has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, ChemoCentryx and our stockholders. The Board has
unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and the Board unanimously
recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.
Under Delaware law, approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares
of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date. Each share of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and outstanding as of the close
of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at the Special Meeting. If a stockholder signs and returns a proxy and does not indicate how he,
she or it wishes to vote on the Merger Proposal, such stockholder’s shares of ChemoCentryx common stock will be voted in favor of the Merger
Proposal.
Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, ChemoCentryx is required to submit a proposal to
ChemoCentryx stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of ChemoCentryx that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as determined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K.
This compensation is summarized in the table set forth below, including the footnotes to the table. This proposal is commonly known as a “say-on-
golden parachute proposal,” and we refer to it as the “Merger Compensation Proposal.”
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information
about compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and
assuming the Merger is consummated on the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy statement, September 13, 2022.
Please note that the amounts indicated below are estimates based on the material assumptions described in the assumptions and notes to the table
below, which may or may not actually occur. Some of these assumptions are based on information currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts,
if any, that may become payable to a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below. For purposes of this
disclosure, “single trigger” refers to payments and benefits that arise solely as a result of the completion of the Merger and “double trigger” refers to
payments and benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger and a qualifying termination of employment.
Furthermore, for purposes of calculating such amounts, we have assumed:
•
a Closing Date of September 13, 2022 (which is the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy statement);
•
the employment of each named executive officer is terminated by ChemoCentryx without “cause” or by the named executive officer for
“good reason,” in either case, immediately following the consummation of the Merger;
•
the named executive officer’s base salary and target bonus will remain unchanged from those applicable as of September 13, 2022;
•
each named executive officer’s outstanding ChemoCentryx equity awards are those that are outstanding and unvested as of September 13,
2022;
•
each named executive officer will receive reimbursement or payment of COBRA premiums, as applicable, for the maximum eligible period;
•
for purposes of the prorated 2022 annual bonus, achievement at the target level of performance;
•
a price per share of ChemoCentryx common stock equal to the Merger Consideration of $52.00; and
•
no reduction will be necessary to mitigate the impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Amounts in this column reflect cash severance that each named executive officer would be eligible to receive under their respective employment
agreement, along with a 2022 prorated bonus.
Under the employment agreements with each of Dr. Schall, Ms. Kanaya and Dr. Cappel, if ChemoCentryx terminates the named executive officer’s
employment without cause or if the named executive officer resigns for good reason, in each case within 12 months following a change in control,
subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, such named executive officer will be entitled to receive: (1) a lump sum cash
payment equal to the named executive officer’s monthly base salary in effect at immediately prior to the time of involuntary termination or
resignation for the 18 month period following the date of termination and (2) a lump sum cash payment equal to one and one-half times the named
executive officer’s target bonus for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurred. The foregoing change in control severance benefits
will only apply so long as the named executive officer is working on a full-time basis.
Under the employment agreements with each of Mr. Butt and Dr. Jain, if ChemoCentryx terminates the named executive officer’s employment
without cause or if the named executive officer resigns for good reason, in each case within 12 months following a change in control, subject to the
execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, such named executive officer will be entitled to receive: (1) a lump sum cash payment equal to
12 months of the named executive officer’s current base salary and (2) a lump sum cash payment equal to the named executive officer’s target
bonus.
If a named executive officer is terminated prior to the payment of his or her fiscal year 2022 bonus under the circumstances that would give rise to
severance under such named executive officer’s employment agreement, then subject to such named executive officer’s execution and non-
revocation of a release of claims in the same form to be executed under his or her employment agreement, such named executive officer will remain
entitled to receive such fiscal year 2022 bonus, prorated for the portion of fiscal year 2022 elapsed prior to the date of termination and based on the
target level of performance if such termination occurs prior to December 31, 2022. The payment of any such prorated bonus is in addition to the
severance under his or her employment agreement, as described above.

As described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP”, amounts in this column reflect the value
of ChemoCentryx stock options and RSUs held by the named executive officer that would accelerate upon the Closing. As of September 13, 2022,
none of the named executive officers hold any ChemoCentryx restricted stock awards or RSUs that would be converted into Amgen Cash Awards.
This table also does not include any outstanding rights to purchase shares under the ESPP held by our executive officers. For additional
information regarding the ESPP, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP” beginning on page 79 of this proxy
statement.
Given that all outstanding equity awards held by the named executive officers as of September 13, 2022, will accelerate at the Closing without
regard to any termination of employment, the amounts listed in the columns entitled “Value of Accelerated Stock Options” and “Value of
Accelerated RSUs” are “single-trigger.”

Under the employment agreements with each of Dr. Schall, Ms. Kanaya and Dr. Cappel, if ChemoCentryx terminates the named executive officer’s
employment without cause or if the named executive officer resigns for good reason, in each case within 12 months following a change in control,
until the date that is 18 months following the date of termination (or, if earlier, the date on which the applicable continuation period under COBRA
ends), the named executive officer is entitled to receive reimbursement of the costs associated with COBRA continuation coverage, such that the
named executive officer’s premiums are the same as for active employees.
Under the employment agreements with each of Mr. Butt and Dr. Jain, if ChemoCentryx terminates the named executive officer’s employment
without cause or if the named executive officer resigns for good reason, in each case within 12 months following a change in control, if the named
executive officer timely elects continued coverage under COBRA, the named executive officer is entitled to receive payment of COBRA premiums
for health insurance coverage until the earliest of (A) the close of the 12 month period following the termination of the named executive officer’s
employment, (B) expiration of the named executive officer’s eligibility for COBRA continuation coverage, or (C) the date on which the named
executive officer becomes eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment or self-employment.
The receipt of the COBRA benefits described above are “double-trigger” and are subject to such executive officer’s execution and non-revocation
of a general release of claims in favor of ChemoCentryx and continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants.
Vote Required
The Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of ChemoCentryx approve the following resolution:
“BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
the compensation that may be paid or become payable to ChemoCentryx’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the section
107
Table of Contents
entitled “Proposal No. 2: Advisory Vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal—The Merger Compensation Proposal—Quantification of
Potential Payments and Benefits to ChemoCentryx’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 105 of the proxy statement dated
September 14, 2022, including the table, associated footnotes and narrative discussion, is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed on a
non-binding, advisory basis.”
Approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock present in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Each share of ChemoCentryx common
stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at the Special Meeting. If a stockholder signs and
returns a proxy and does not indicate how he, she or it wishes to vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal, such stockholder’s shares of
ChemoCentryx common stock will be voted in favor of the Merger Compensation Proposal. If a ChemoCentryx stockholder abstains from voting, it will
have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Merger Compensation Proposal. If a ChemoCentryx stockholder fails to vote, it will have
no effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to
approve the Merger Proposal and vote against or abstain with respect to the Merger Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the
Merger Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either ChemoCentryx or Amgen. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is
approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of
the non-binding, advisory vote of ChemoCentryx’s stockholders on the Merger Compensation Proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting, which we refer to as the “Adjournment
Proposal.” If our stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting to solicit additional proxies, including the
solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against the Merger Proposal. Among other
things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the
Merger Proposal such that the Merger Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Proposal and
seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. In addition, the chairperson of the Special
Meeting could adjourn the Special Meeting if under our amended and restated bylaws a quorum is not present for the meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, ChemoCentryx’s right to adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting, and the number of times that ChemoCentryx
may adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting, and the duration of any such adjournment or postponement, is subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement as described further under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—Special Meeting and Related Actions” beginning
on page 88 of this proxy statement.
If the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to
revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting as adjourned or postponed. If a stockholder signs and returns a proxy and does not
indicate how he, she or it wishes to vote on the Adjournment Proposal, such stockholder’s shares of ChemoCentryx common stock will be voted in favor
of the Adjournment Proposal. ChemoCentryx does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved at the
Special Meeting.
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of ChemoCentryx and our stockholders to be able to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary for
the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in respect of the Merger Proposal if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of
the Special Meeting.
Vote Required
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of ChemoCentryx
common stock present in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Each share of ChemoCentryx common stock issued and
outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at the Special Meeting. If a stockholder signs and returns a proxy and

“AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal. If a ChemoCentryx stockholder fails to vote, it will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal. Broker non-
votes, if any, will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve

The following table sets forth information relating to the beneficial ownership of ChemoCentryx common stock as of September 13, 2022, by:
•
each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock;
•
each of our directors;
•
each of our named executive officers; and
•
all directors and executive officers as a group.
The number of shares beneficially owned by each entity, person, director or executive officer is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC,
and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any
shares over which the individual has sole or shared voting power or investment power as well as any shares that the individual has the right to acquire
within 60 days of September 13, 2022, through the exercise of any stock option, warrants or other rights or the vesting of any RSUs. Except as otherwise
indicated, and subject to applicable community property laws, the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all
shares of common stock held by that person.
The percentage of shares beneficially owned is computed on the basis of 71,919,705 shares of ChemoCentryx common stock outstanding as of
September 13, 2022. Shares of ChemoCentryx common stock that a person has the right to acquire within 60 days of September 13, 2022 are deemed
outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of the person holding such rights, but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of
computing the percentage ownership of any other person, except with respect to the percentage ownership of all directors and executive officers as a
group. Unless otherwise indicated below, the address for each beneficial owner listed is c/o ChemoCentryx, Inc., 835 Industrial Road, Suite 600, San
Carlos, CA 94070.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
If the Merger is consummated, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of our
stockholders. However, if the Merger is not consummated, our stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in meetings of our
stockholders.
We intend to hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2023 only if the Merger is not consummated.
Proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2023 must be received by us no later than
December 6, 2022, which is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the mailing date of ChemoCentryx’s proxy statement for its annual meeting of
stockholders held on May 26, 2022, in order to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting, unless the date of the 2023
annual meeting of stockholders is changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary of our 2022 annual meeting, in which case the deadline for such
proposals will be a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials. These proposals must comply with the requirements as to form
and substance established by the SEC for such proposals in order to be included in the proxy statement.
In addition, our amended and restated bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to certain matters, including stockholder
proposals not included in our annual meeting proxy statement, to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders. In general, notice must be
received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 calendar days before nor more than 120 calendar days before the one year anniversary of the
previous year’s annual meeting of stockholders. Therefore, to be presented at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, such a proposal must be received
by us no earlier than January 26, 2023 and no later than February 25, 2023. However, if the date of the 2023 annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier or
more than 60 days later than such anniversary date, notice must be received not later than the close of business on the later of 90 calendar days in
advance of such annual meeting or, if later, ten calendar days following the date on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first
made. If the stockholder fails to give notice by these dates, then the persons named as proxies in the proxies solicited by the board of directors for the
2023 annual meeting may exercise discretionary voting power regarding any such proposal. Stockholders are advised to review our amended and restated
bylaws which also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice.
In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under our bylaws, to comply with the SEC’s universal proxy rules, stockholders who wish to
solicit proxies in support of director nominees to be voted upon at the 2023 annual meeting other than our proposed nominees must provide notice that
sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than March 27, 2023.
Except as otherwise set forth above, proposals should be addressed to:

following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and shall have made its Representatives
available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and Parent’s Representatives any proposed amendments or modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and (D) no earlier than the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Board of Directors shall have
concluded, after considering the terms of any amendment or modification to this Agreement offered by Parent during such period, and after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to either effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under Applicable
Law (it being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a
notice hereunder shall require an additional notice to Parent and the four (4) Business Day period shall be extended until at least two (2) Business
Days after the time that Parent receives such additional notice); and
(iii) if an Intervening Event occurs, the Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of such Intervening
Event; provided that (A) the Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under Applicable Law and (B) prior
to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, (1) the Company shall have given Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice
of its intention to affect an Adverse Recommendation Change (which notice shall not, in and of itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change), which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event, (2) if requested to do so by Parent, during the
period of four (4) Business Days following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and shall have
made its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and Parent’s Representatives, any proposed amendments or
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (3) no earlier than the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Board of
Directors shall have concluded, after considering the terms of any amendment or modification to this Agreement offered by Parent during such
period, and after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of such
Intervening Event would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under Applicable Law (it
being understood and agreed that any material change to the changes, events, circumstances or developments constituting the Intervening Event
that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require an additional notice to Parent and the four (4) Business Day period shall be
extended until at least two (2) Business Days after the time that Parent receives such additional notice).
(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement, including in this Section 6.03, shall restrict the Board of Directors or the Company from (i) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the 1934 Act; provided that, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), any such disclosure or communication shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless such disclosure or communication includes an express reaffirmation, without qualification, of the Company
Board Recommendation.
(d) Required Notices. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company
(or any of its Representatives) of any bona fide Acquisition Proposal or
A-39
Table of Contents
any offers, proposals, inquiries or indications of interest with respect thereto or that the Company believes is or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, including (i) the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal or offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of
interest, (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions thereof (it being agreed that such summary will only be required to be provided to the extent
such information is not included in the information and materials provided to Parent under clause (iii) hereof) and (iii) an unredacted copy of any written
proposal, written offer, or other written material received from such Third Party or its Representatives in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, and
shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the status (including changes to the material terms or other material developments) of such Acquisition
Proposal, offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest on a reasonably prompt basis and within twenty-four (24) hours of (i) any such material changes
or material developments or (ii) any written request of Parent for such information. The Company shall also notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company of any initial request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal.
(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any revisions to this Agreement made or offered in writing by Parent prior to the time of such
determination, would be more favorable to the Company’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger; provided, that for purposes of the
definition of “Superior Proposal”, the references to “20%” in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed references to “50%.”
(f) Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives
conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day of the date hereof) terminate access by any
such Third Party and its Representatives to any physical or electronic data room relating to any such discussions or negotiations and request the return
or destruction of all information furnished by the Company or on its behalf to any such Third Party and its Representatives, and shall enforce and not
waive, amend or release any Third Party from the provisions of its confidentiality agreements with such Third Parties; provided, however, that the Board
of Directors may, or may authorize the Company to, waive any standstill agreement with any Third Party, or any standstill provision included in a
confidentiality agreement with any Third Party, in each case, subject to compliance with this Section 6.03, in response to an unsolicited request from a
Third Party in the event that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure
to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under Applicable Law.",166,169

in such preparation) and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such filing to
occur no later than August 29, 2022. Unless the Board of Directors has made an Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 6.03, the
Company and the Board of Directors shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in proxy
statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, and each covenants that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation in the Proxy

the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent shall provide the Company such
assistance and cooperation as may be reasonably requested by the Company in the preparation of the information related to Parent or Merger Subsidiary
to be included in the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date on which the Company learns that the Proxy
Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto,
prior to filing such documents with the SEC or disseminating them to holders of Shares and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all
responses to requests for additional information, and shall consider any comments proposed by Parent in good faith. If, at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders’ Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and correct
such information, and the Company shall file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information.
(b) Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in accordance with Applicable Law, the Company Certificate and bylaws of the Company) after the date
on which the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the “Company Stockholders’
Meeting”), and, subject to Section 6.03(b), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; provided,
however, that the Company may, and shall at the written request of Parent, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders’ Meeting on no more than
two occasions (for the Company and Parent in the aggregate) and for no longer than ten (10) Business Days from the prior scheduled date and to a date
no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the End Date:
(i) after consultation with Parent, (A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B) to solicit additional proxies if, at the time of such postponement
or adjournment, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Company Stockholder Approval to be
received at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present; or
(ii) after consultation with Parent, to allow reasonable additional time for (A) the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required
by Applicable Law and (B) for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated in a manner suitable under Applicable Law and
reviewed by the Company’s stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting.
(c) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company shall submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for adoption at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and shall not submit any

following:
(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company or its

director of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) as provided (i) under the Company Certificate or bylaws of the Company or the articles of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents of the applicable Subsidiaries and (ii) in any indemnification agreement between the Company or a Company Subsidiary and
any such Indemnified Person in the form made available to Parent or its Representatives prior to the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Persons, and shall be

(together with its successors and assigns, the “Indemnifying Parties”) shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to), to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law and the Company Certificate and the bylaws of the Company (as in effect as of the date hereof), indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,

the Effective Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law and the Company Certificate and the
bylaws of the Company (as in effect as of the date hereof), advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
and documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.02(b), subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor of the
Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 7.02(b).
(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay the premium
for the non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies

favorable than the coverage provided under the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance policies in effect as of the
date hereof; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for the D&O Tail Policy an aggregate premium
amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium amount currently paid or payable by the Company with respect to its existing directors’ and
officers’ insurance policies as in effect on the date hereof (the “Premium Cap”), and if the aggregate premium amount of such insurance coverage would
exceed such Premium Cap, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal
to the Premium Cap. From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect) the D&O Tail Policy.

the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.02.

(a) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall provide the employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time during the period they continue to be employed by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and/or its or Parent’s Subsidiaries on and after the Effective Time (the “Covered Employees”) with (i) base salary (or base wages, as the case
may be) and short-term cash incentive compensation targets (including, but not limited to, bonuses and commissions), each of which is no less favorable
than the base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term cash incentive compensation targets provided to such Covered Employees
immediately prior to the date hereof, (ii) severance pay and benefits that are no less favorable than the severance pay and benefits provided under the
Employee Plans set forth on Section 7.03(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the “Company Severance Plans”) as in effect on the date hereof, and
(iii) benefits (excluding severance, equity and long-term incentive compensation) that are, in the aggregate and at a minimum, substantially equivalent to
the benefits (excluding severance, equity and long-term incentive compensation) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries.
Parent agrees that, upon the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor all Employee Plans (including all severance and employment plans and
agreements) for all Covered Employees, in each case, in accordance with their terms; provided that nothing herein shall prohibit Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from amending, suspending or terminating any such Employee Plans (including any such severance and employment plans and agreements)
in accordance with their terms and Applicable Law. Parent acknowledges that, upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, a “Change in Control” (or
“Change of Control” as the case may be) of the Company shall have occurred for purposes of each of the Employee Plans in which such definition
occurs. If, prior to the Closing, the Company has not granted annual equity awards for the 2023 fiscal year (as permitted by this Agreement), a Covered
Employee will be eligible to receive an annual equity award for such fiscal year on a substantially similar basis as applies to a similarly situated employee
of Parent and its Subsidiaries (as determined by Parent).
(b) Parent shall provide all Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits under any
employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement

participate (the “Parent Plans”) for all periods of employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time

such Covered Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, and with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
any of their Subsidiaries on and after the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply (A) for any purpose under any defined benefit
pension plan or retiree welfare plan, (B) for purposes of any Parent Plan under which similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not
receive credit for prior service, (C) for purposes of any Parent Plan that is grandfathered or frozen to new participants, either with respect to level of
benefits or participation or (D) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required
physical examinations under any Parent Plan to be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived
under the corresponding plan in which the applicable Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) to the extent not
prohibited by the terms, or by any third party administrator, of any fully insured medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, credit each Covered Employee with all deductible payments, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents under the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of the Company prior to the
Closing during the plan year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which such Covered Employee has satisfied the
deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan
year under any medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or its Affiliates, as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such plan (to the extent such credit would have been given under comparable Employee Plans prior to the Closing).
(c) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such
corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Employee Plans that are United States Tax-qualified defined contribution plans (collectively, the
“Company DC Plan”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of such resolutions approved in connection with the
foregoing termination shall be subject to the prior review and written approval of Parent. Upon the distribution of the assets in the accounts under the
Company DC Plan to the participants, Parent shall permit the Covered Employees who are then actively employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to make
rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), excluding rollovers of outstanding plan
loans, in the form of cash, from the Company DC Plan to the applicable tax-qualified defined contribution plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries.
(d) Other than with respect to confidential communications to or by the Board of Directors or in connection with an Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with Section 6.03, prior to making any broad-based or any written communications to the directors, officers, employees or
consultants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any communications consistent in all material respects with prior communications made
by the Company or Parent) pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that relate to the Merger, the Company shall, to the extent not prohibited by
Applicable Law, (i) provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, (ii) give Parent a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication and (iii) consider any such comments in good faith.
(e) No later than fifteen (15) days after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide to Parent a list of the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, describing or identifying each employee’s name, employee identification number, employing entity,
position or title, annual salary (or base hourly wage rate), short-term cash incentive compensation opportunity (including target and maximum
opportunities), amount of last annual bonus paid, other incentive compensation, assigned work location, leave of absence status, overtime and minimum

to Parent updates to the foregoing information (but in no event more frequently than monthly) and such other data as reasonably requested by Parent to
provide benefits, payroll, or any other employee-related service to Company employees, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
(f) The parties shall take the actions necessary to implement the commitments set forth on Section 7.03(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, the provisions of this Section 7.03 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee or other service provider or other individual associated therewith (including any dependent or beneficiary thereof) shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to be the
establishment of or an amendment or modification to any Employee Plan, Parent Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement
of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any purpose; (ii) guarantee employment for any period of time, or preclude the ability of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to terminate or discharge any employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including any Covered Employee, at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause; or (iii) require Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Employee Plan, Parent Plan or employee benefits plans or arrangements or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof, in accordance with the terms thereof and Applicable Law.

within two (2) Business Days after the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (C).
(iv) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated under circumstances where the Termination Fee is due and payable and Parent or
its designee shall have received full payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 11.04(b) and any other amounts due pursuant to the
second sentence of Section 11.04(c), the receipt of the Termination Fee and such other amounts shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any
and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives or any other
Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives (collectively, “Parent Related
Parties”) or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company Related Parties arising out
of, relating to, or in connection with, this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters forming the basis for

Company for such amount payable pursuant to this Section 11.04 and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid pursuant to this Section 11.04 and ending on the date that

was required to be made plus five percent (5%), or such lesser rate per annum that is the maximum permitted under Applicable Law. Except as otherwise
set forth in Section 2.03(c), all transfer, documentary, stamp, registration, and other similar Taxes imposed with respect to the Merger shall be borne by the

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, as applicable.
