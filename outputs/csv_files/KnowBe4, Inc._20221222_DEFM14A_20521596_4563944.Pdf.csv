On October 11, 2022, KnowBe4 entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions,
Merger Sub will merge with and into KnowBe4, with KnowBe4 surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent is an affiliate of
Vista, a leading private equity firm focused on investments in software, data and technology-enabled companies. If the Merger is completed, each
outstanding share of KnowBe4 common stock (other than as described below) will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Price, without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, and KnowBe4 will become a privately held company. KnowBe4 is asking its stockholders to
consider and vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
The KnowBe4 Board formed the Special Committee to engage with Vista, to consider other potential value creation opportunities and to take other
actions that the Special Committee deemed appropriate. As more fully described below, the Special Committee evaluated among other things, the
Merger, with the assistance of its own independent financial and legal advisors and, where appropriate, KnowBe4 management and KnowBe4’s
outside legal advisor. At the conclusion of its review, the Special Committee, among other things, unanimously (1) determined that the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders; and (2) recommended
that the KnowBe4 Board approve the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and determine that the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders. The KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee, (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of KnowBe4
and its stockholders, including the Unaffiliated Stockholders; and (2) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
Because the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement constitute a “going private” transaction under the rules of the SEC, the Purchaser
Filing Parties have filed with the SEC a Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 with respect to such transactions. You may obtain additional
information about the Schedule 13E-3 under the caption “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

Sub to consummate the Merger, and the Guarantors and the KKR Investor to cause the equity financing to be funded pursuant to the
Equity Commitment Letters (or, in the case of the KKR Investor, satisfied with Rollover Shares pursuant to the Rollover Stockholder
Support Agreement entered into by the KKR Investor), if certain conditions are satisfied, including the funding or availability of the
debt financing.

This means that these holders of record and beneficial owners may be entitled to have their shares of KnowBe4 common stock
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of KnowBe4 common
stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with (unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate
of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period
between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time
before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to persons entitled to
appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of
the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The
surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, any persons who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of
their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Appraisal Rights—Determination of Fair Value.”
 
•
To exercise appraisal rights, a holder of record or a beneficial owner of KnowBe4 common stock must (1) submit a written demand for
appraisal of such holder’s or owner’s shares of KnowBe4 common stock to KnowBe4 before the vote is taken on the Merger Proposal;
(2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the Merger Proposal (whether by voting against the Merger Proposal, abstaining or
otherwise not voting with respect to the Merger Proposal); (3) continuously hold (in the case of holders of record) or continuously
own (in the case of beneficial owners) the subject shares of KnowBe4 common stock through the effective date of the Merger; and (4)
strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of
KnowBe4 common stock and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights in such capacity, in addition to the foregoing requirements,
your demand for appraisal must also (1) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares of KnowBe4 common stock for which the
demand is made, (2) be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such
documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and (3) provide an address at which you consent to receive
notices given by the surviving corporation hereunder and to be set forth on the verified list required by Section 262(f) of DGCL. The
failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. The requirements under
Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting and exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Appraisal Rights,” which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section

The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting.
These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you. KnowBe4 encourages you to carefully read the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents to which KnowBe4
refers in this proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the
instructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
 
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
 
A:
On October 11, 2022, KnowBe4 entered into the Merger Agreement. Under the Merger Agreement, Parent will acquire KnowBe4 for the Per Share
Price. In order to complete the Merger, KnowBe4’s stockholders must vote to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special
Meeting pursuant to the requisite stockholder votes. This approval is a condition to the consummation of the Merger. See the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.” The KnowBe4 Board is furnishing this proxy statement
and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of KnowBe4’s
stockholders to be voted at the Special Meeting.
This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Special
Meeting and the matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of
KnowBe4 common stock without attending the Special Meeting and to ensure that your shares of KnowBe4 common stock are represented and
voted at the Special Meeting.
Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, KnowBe4 encourages you to submit a proxy as soon as possible.
 
Q:
What is the Merger and what effects will it have on KnowBe4?
 
A:
The Merger is the acquisition of KnowBe4 by Parent. If the Merger Proposal is approved by KnowBe4’s stockholders and the other closing
conditions under the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into KnowBe4, with KnowBe4 continuing as the
surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, KnowBe4 will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and KnowBe4 Class A common stock
will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from Nasdaq. In addition, KnowBe4 Class A common stock will be deregistered under the
Exchange Act, and KnowBe4 will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
 
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
 
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for
each share of KnowBe4 common stock that you own (other than the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Shares), unless you have properly perfected
and exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL
are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of KnowBe4 common stock, you will receive $2,490.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of
KnowBe4 common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
 
Q:
How does the Per Share Price compare to the market price of the KnowBe4 Class A common stock?
 
A:
This amount constitutes a premium of approximately 44 percent to the unaffected closing price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock of $17.30 per
share on September 16, 2022, the last full trading day before Vista publicly disclosed its initial non-binding acquisition proposal.

•
At the effective time of the Merger each KnowBe4 RSU Award and each KnowBe4 PSU Award, to the extent vested but not yet settled as of
the effective time of the Merger (or which vests upon the consummation of the Merger), will automatically be canceled and converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Price and (2) the total number of shares of

other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the Merger.
 
•
At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding KnowBe4 RSU Award, to the extent not then vested, will automatically be canceled
and converted into a contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Price and (2)
the total number of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock subject to the then-unvested portion of such award. This amount (less any
required withholding and other taxes) will vest and be paid out pursuant to the corresponding KnowBe4 RSU Award’s time-based vesting

prior to the effective time of the Merger.
 
•
At the effective time of the Merger, each KnowBe4 PSU Award, to the extent not then vested, will be deemed to have the performance
metrics achieved at 100 percent of target, and will be canceled and converted into a contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Price and (2) the total number of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock subject to the
then-unvested portion of such award. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will vest and be paid out pursuant to the
corresponding KnowBe4 PSU Award’s time-based vesting schedule, subject to the same terms and conditions (including continued

exercise price per share of such KnowBe4 Option Award, and (2) the number of shares of KnowBe4 common stock then issuable upon
exercise in full of such vested KnowBe4 Option Award. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the
applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the Merger.
 
•
At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding KnowBe4 Option Award, to the extent not then vested, will be canceled and converted
into a contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price
less the exercise price per share of such KnowBe4 Option Award, and (2) the number of shares of KnowBe4 common stock then issuable
upon exercise in full of the unvested portion of such KnowBe4 Option Award. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)
will vest and be paid out pursuant to the corresponding KnowBe4 Option Award’s time-based vesting schedule, subject to the same terms
and conditions (including continued employment) as applied to the KnowBe4 Option Award immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger.

A:
Generally speaking, the ESPP will be treated as follows:

From and after the date of the Merger Agreement, (1) no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP and
(2) no further contributions will be made to the ESPP by payroll deductions or other methods.

account and will be treated in the same manner as any other outstanding share of KnowBe4 Class A common stock in connection with the
consummation of the Merger. Any amounts not used for the purchase of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock will be refunded.

with KnowBe4 continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;
 
•
The Compensation Proposal: the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become

•
The Adjournment Proposal: the proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting.
 
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
 
A:
The Special Meeting will take place virtually on January 31, 2023, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time. You may attend the Special Meeting solely via a live

live and vote online. You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting instruction form in order to participate in the Special
Meeting (including voting your shares).
 
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
All of KnowBe4’s stockholders as of the close of business on December 7, 2022, which is the Record Date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to
vote their shares of KnowBe4 common stock at the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 132,747,542 shares of KnowBe4 Class A
common stock and 44,539,649 shares of KnowBe4 Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. For each share of
KnowBe4 Class A common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the Record Date, you will have one vote on each matter submitted
for a vote at the Special Meeting. For each share of KnowBe4 Class B common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the Record
Date, you will have ten votes on each matter submitted for a vote at the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Merger Proposal?
 
A:
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of (1) the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of
KnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a single class) entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement; (2) the holders of a majority of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a single class) held by the Unaffiliated Stockholders and entitled
to vote on the Merger Agreement; (3) the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock entitled to

Table of Contents
Q:
What vote is required to approve each of (1) the Compensation Proposal and (2) the Adjournment Proposal?
 
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares cast affirmatively or negatively
on such proposal. This vote will be on a non-binding, advisory basis.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares cast affirmatively or negatively
on such proposal.
 
Q:
What happens if I fail to vote or abstain from voting on a proposal?
 
A:
If you (1) are a stockholder of record and fail to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone, or vote your shares at
the Special Meeting, or if you (2) hold in “street name” and you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your
shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, and such failure to vote will have the
same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will not have any effect on the outcome of the vote on the Compensation Proposal or
the Adjournment Proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
With respect to the Merger Proposal, if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence
of a quorum, but such abstention will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. With respect to the Compensation
Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum, but abstentions are not considered votes cast affirmatively or negatively and therefore will not have any effect on the
outcome of such proposals.
 
Q:
How will KnowBe4’s directors and executive officers and certain other stockholders vote on the Merger Proposal?
 
A:
KnowBe4’s directors and executive officers have informed KnowBe4 that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the
shares of KnowBe4 common stock owned directly by them in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment
Proposal. As of the Record Date, KnowBe4’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
approximately 47 percent of the voting power of the shares of KnowBe4 common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. For more information,
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Special Factors—Intent of KnowBe4’s Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the
Merger.”
Kevin Mitnick, as trustee of the Mitnick Trust, who beneficially owned approximately 9 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of
KnowBe4 common stock as of the Record Date, entered into the Mitnick Support Agreement, pursuant to which he agreed, by and on behalf of the
Mitnick Trust, to vote all of the Mitnick Shares in favor of the Merger Proposal, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Mitnick
Support Agreement. In addition, the Rollover Stockholders, who beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 71 percent of the voting power
of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock as of the Record Date, entered into the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements pursuant
to which they agreed to vote all of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock in favor of the Merger Proposal, subject to certain terms and conditions
contained in the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements. However, approval of the Merger Proposal also requires the Unaffiliated Stockholder
Vote, which excludes all of the shares of KnowBe4 common stock held (1) by the Rollover Stockholders and certain of their affiliates and (2)
KnowBe4’s officers, but does not exclude the Mitnick Shares. For more information, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “Special
Factors—Intent of Certain Stockholders to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and “The Support Agreements,” as well as the full text of the Support
Agreements, attached as Annex C, Annex D, Annex E, Annex F and Annex G, which are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in their
entirety.

Q:
What do I need to do now?
 
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that KnowBe4 refers to in this proxy
statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then, even if you expect to attend the Special Meeting, please sign, date and return,
as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience), or grant your proxy electronically

Q:
What is the Special Committee, and what role did it play in evaluating the Merger?
 
A:
In July 2022, the KnowBe4 Board formed the Special Committee to engage with Vista, to consider other potential value creation opportunities, and
to take other actions that the Special Committee deemed appropriate. As more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Special Factors—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board,” the Special Committee
evaluated the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, with the assistance of its own independent financial and legal advisors and, where appropriate, KnowBe4
management and KnowBe4’s outside legal advisor. At the conclusion of its review, the Special Committee, among other things, unanimously (1)
determined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated
Stockholders; and (2) recommended that the KnowBe4 Board approve the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the
Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and determine that the Merger Agreement,
the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders. The KnowBe4 Board, acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the
Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of KnowBe4 and its stockholders, including the Unaffiliated Stockholders; and (2) approved and declared advisable the Merger
Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger.
 
Q:
How does the KnowBe4 Board recommend that I vote?
 
A:
The KnowBe4 Board unanimously recommends that you vote:
 
•
“FOR” the approval of the Merger Proposal;
 
•
“FOR” the approval of the Compensation Proposal; and
 
•
“FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
You should read the section of this proxy statement captioned “Special Factors—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special
Committee and the KnowBe4 Board” for a discussion of the factors that the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board considered in deciding to
recommend and/or approve, as applicable, the approval of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
 
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the requisite votes of KnowBe4’s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
KnowBe4’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their
 
21
Table of Contents
shares of KnowBe4 common stock. Instead: (1) KnowBe4 will remain an independent public company; (2) KnowBe4 Class A common stock will
continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) KnowBe4 will continue to file periodic reports with the
SEC.
In specified circumstances in which the Merger Agreement is terminated, KnowBe4 has agreed to pay Parent a termination fee. In specified
circumstances in which the Merger Agreement is terminated, Parent has agreed to pay KnowBe4 a reverse termination fee, the payment of which
has been guaranteed by the Guarantors. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—
Termination Fees and Remedies.”
 
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
 
A:
The compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to KnowBe4’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger is certain
compensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of KnowBe4’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans
and arrangements that are contractual in nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Parent or its affiliates (including, following the
consummation of the Merger, the surviving corporation) to KnowBe4’s named executive officers in connection with or following the Merger is not
subject to this advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 2: The Compensation
Proposal.”
 
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger?
 
A:
KnowBe4 is required to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger is not required to consummate the Merger.
 
Q:
What will happen if KnowBe4’s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger?
 
A:
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is not a
condition to consummation of the Merger. This is an advisory vote and will not be binding on KnowBe4 or Parent. The underlying plans and
arrangements providing for such compensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by KnowBe4’s stockholders and the Merger is consummated, the compensation that will or may
become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger will or may be paid to KnowBe4’s named executive
officers even if KnowBe4’s stockholders do not approve such compensation.
 
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with KnowBe4’s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with
respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” If you are a stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been
sent directly to you by or on behalf of KnowBe4. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the Special Meeting and vote your shares at the
Special Meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of KnowBe4 common stock
held in “street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of
 
22
Table of Contents
KnowBe4 common stock held in “street name,” this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is
considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or
other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However,
because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the Special Meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your
bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
 
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special
Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares.
If you do not provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any of the proposals, which
will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Compensation
Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, except to the extent affecting the obtaining of a quorum at the meeting.
 
Q:
How may I vote?
 
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of KnowBe4 common stock are registered in your name with Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., KnowBe4’s transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
 
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience);
 
•
by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
 
•
by calling the toll-free (within the United States. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
 
•
by attending the Special Meeting and voting at the Special Meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of KnowBe4 common stock
and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although
there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access
and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of KnowBe4 common stock by proxy. If you are a
stockholder of record or if you provide a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may vote your shares of KnowBe4 common
stock at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote at the Special Meeting, your
vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker
or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or nominee. However, because
you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the Special Meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank,
broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Special Meeting.

Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
Yes. You may attend the Special Meeting via live interactive webcast on the internet at http://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/KNBE2023SM.
You will be able to listen to the Special Meeting live and vote online. The Special Meeting will begin at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on January 31, 2023.
Online check-in will begin a few minutes prior to the Special Meeting. You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting
instruction form in order to participate in the Special Meeting (including voting your shares). As the Special Meeting is virtual, there will be no
physical meeting location.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Special Meeting, KnowBe4 encourages you to
promptly sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card). If you attend the Special Meeting and vote at the
Special Meeting, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
If, as of the Record Date, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” you may not vote your shares at the Special Meeting unless
you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Special Meeting. Otherwise,
you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting
without your instructions.
 
Q:
Why did KnowBe4 choose to hold a virtual Special Meeting?
 
A:
The KnowBe4 Board decided to hold the Special Meeting virtually in order to facilitate stockholder attendance and participation by enabling
stockholders to participate fully, and equally, from virtually any location around the world, at no cost. However, you will bear any costs associated
with your internet access, such as usage charges from internet access providers and telephone companies. KnowBe4 believes this is the right
choice for a company with a global footprint. A virtual Special Meeting makes it possible for more stockholders (regardless of size, resources or
physical location) to have direct access to information, while saving KnowBe4 and its stockholders time and money. KnowBe4 also believes that
the online tools that it has selected will increase stockholder communication. KnowBe4 remains very sensitive to concerns that virtual meetings
may diminish stockholder voice or reduce accountability. Accordingly, KnowBe4 has designed its virtual format to enhance, rather than constrain,
stockholder access, participation and communication.
 
Q:
What is a proxy?
 
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of KnowBe4 common stock. The written
document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to
designate a proxy to vote your shares of KnowBe4 common stock is called a “proxy card.” You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to
designate a proxy by telephone or by the Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card. Sjoerd Sjouwerman
and Robert Reich, each with full power of substitution and re-substitution, have been designated as proxy holders for the Special Meeting by the
KnowBe4 Board.
 
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
 
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:
 
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to KnowBe4 prior to the Special Meeting;
 
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to KnowBe4’s Corporate Secretary; or
 
24
Table of Contents
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting at the Special Meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If you hold your shares of KnowBe4 common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions
regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, with full power of substitution and re-
substitution, will vote your shares in the way that you direct.
If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the KnowBe4 Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be
voted: (1) “FOR” the approval of the Merger Proposal; (2) “FOR” the approval of the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the approval of the
Adjournment Proposal, and in the proxyholders’ discretion with respect to any other business that may properly come before the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to
send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of KnowBe4 common stock
represented by your stock certificates. Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates
for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you hold your shares of
KnowBe4 common stock in book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of transmittal. Instead, the payment agent will pay you the appropriate
portion of the aggregate Per Share Price (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) upon receipt of a customary “agent’s message” and any other
items specified by the payment agent.
 
Q:
What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of KnowBe4 common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
 
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the expected effective date of the Merger. If you sell or
transfer your shares of KnowBe4 common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies KnowBe4 in writing
of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Price with respect to such shares, if the Merger is completed, to the
person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or
transfer your shares of KnowBe4 common stock after the Record Date, KnowBe4 encourages you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy
card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the
instructions found on the proxy card).
 
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy card and voting instruction form
that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than
one brokerage account, you will
 
25
Table of Contents
receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares
are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting materials that you receive.
 
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
 
A:
If available, KnowBe4 may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. KnowBe4 intends to publish final voting
results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that KnowBe4 files with the SEC are
publicly available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
 
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
 
A:
If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Special Factors—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of KnowBe4 common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in
the shares of KnowBe4 common stock surrendered in the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Special Factors—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of KnowBe4 common stock for
cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless
the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
Because particular circumstances may differ, KnowBe4 recommends that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax
consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax
laws or the laws of any territory, state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and does not
constitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “Special Factors—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
 
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
 
A:
KnowBe4 currently expects to complete the Merger in 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger, if at all, cannot be predicted
because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of its control.
 
Q:
What governmental and regulatory approvals are required?
 
A:
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act
has expired or been terminated. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on November 25, 2022.
 
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
 
A:
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied, holders of record and beneficial owners
of KnowBe4 common stock who (1) do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal (whether by voting against the Merger Proposal, abstaining or
otherwise not voting with respect to the Merger Proposal); (2) continuously hold (in the case of holders of record) or continuously own
 
26
Table of Contents
(in the case of beneficial owners) their applicable shares of KnowBe4 common stock through the effective date of the Merger; (3) properly demand
appraisal of their applicable shares; (4) meet certain statutory requirements as described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their
demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262
of the DGCL. This means that such holders of record and beneficial owners will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise
for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the Merger
through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded
quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to
each person seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving
corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons who wish to seek appraisal of
their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal
process. The DGCL requirements for perfecting and exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Appraisal Rights,” which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, which

Q:
Do any of KnowBe4’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of KnowBe4’s stockholders generally?
 
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendations of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board with respect to the Merger, you should be aware that,
aside from their interests as holders of KnowBe4 common stock and equity awards, KnowBe4’s directors and executive officers may have interests
in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board were aware
of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Special Factors—Interests of KnowBe4’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
 
Q:
Who can help answer my questions?
 
A:

proxy statement or need help submitting your proxy or voting your shares of KnowBe4 common stock, please contact KnowBe4’s proxy solicitor:

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. This chronology does not purport
to catalogue every conversation of or among the KnowBe4 Board, the Special Committee, the representatives of KnowBe4 or the Special Committee,
or other parties, including Vista and the Rollover Stockholders.
The KnowBe4 Board regularly evaluates KnowBe4’s strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening KnowBe4’s
business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the KnowBe4 Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic
alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, our current business plan, with KnowBe4
remaining an independent entity; (2) the investment in, and development of, new products and services, and expansion into new markets; (3) capital
raising activities; (4) potential expansion opportunities through acquisitions, partnerships or other commercial relationships; and (5) business
combinations and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of KnowBe4.
Vista, through the VEPF funds, first became an investor in KnowBe4 prior to KnowBe4’s initial public offering in 2021 (the “IPO”). Prior to that
investment, Vista and KnowBe4 discussed, in general terms, a variety of different transactions, including the possible acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista.
These discussions never advanced beyond the preliminary stage. Vista, through the VEPF funds, purchased additional shares of KnowBe4 Class A
common stock as a participant in the IPO. In addition to conversations with Vista pre-IPO, KnowBe4 had a small number of high-level conversations with
other potential acquirors.
On May 6, 2021, Vista, through the VEPF Funds, filed a Schedule 13D that reflected its ownership of KnowBe4 common stock.
On May 20, 2022 and June 1, 2022, Stephen Shanley, a member of the KnowBe4 Board and an employee of KKR, spoke with representatives of Vista at
Vista’s request, in connection with Vista’s routine process for evaluating its current investments. During these conversations, the parties discussed
KnowBe4’s business and the industry generally, and the representatives of Vista discussed potential opportunities for the company, including raising
whether the company was potentially interested in pursuing a sale transaction.
On May 26, 2022, Krish Venkataraman, a member of the KnowBe4 Board, and representatives of Vista spoke in connection with Vista’s routine process for
evaluating its current investments. During this conversation, the parties discussed KnowBe4’s business. The parties did not discuss any potential
acquisition of KnowBe4 at this time.
On June 8, 2022, Jeremiah Daly, a member of the KnowBe4 Board and the co-founder and general partner of Elephant, spoke with representatives of Vista
at Vista’s request, in connection with Vista’s routine process for evaluating its current investments. During this meeting, the parties discussed KnowBe4’s
business and the industry generally, and a representative of Vista discussed potential opportunities for the company, including raising whether the
company was potentially interested in pursuing a sale transaction.
Following these discussions, Messrs. Shanley and Daly both recommended that representatives of Vista meet with Sjoerd Sjouwerman, Chairperson of
the KnowBe4 Board and Chief Executive Officer of KnowBe4, whom they had never met in person.
On June 16, 2022, Messrs. Shanley, Daly and Sjouwerman spoke with representatives of Vista, at Vista’s request, in connection with Vista’s routine
process for evaluating its current investments. During this meeting, the parties discussed KnowBe4’s business and the industry generally, and a
representative of Vista discussed potential opportunities for the company, including raising whether the company was potentially interested in pursuing a
sale transaction.
 
28Table of Contents
On June 22, 2022, Messrs. Daly and Sjouwerman met in person with representatives of Vista. During this meeting, the representatives of Vista discussed,
in general terms, the industry in which KnowBe4 operates and Vista’s existing investment in KnowBe4. During this conversation, representatives of Vista
expressed their confidence in KnowBe4’s business and indicated that if KnowBe4 were ever to be interested in a transaction, Vista would want to be
included. The representatives of Vista did not propose an acquisition or any other transaction involving KnowBe4 or discuss any potential acquisition
terms during this meeting.
On June 22, 2022, Mr. Daly reached out to a representative at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation (“Wilson Sonsini”), outside
legal advisor to KnowBe4, to inform them as to the conversations with Vista up to that point. Wilson Sonsini then coordinated a special meeting of the
Board on June 28, 2022. At that meeting, the KnowBe4 Board discussed the recent conversations between certain Board members and Vista and
confirmed that the participants in those meetings did not engage in any discussions regarding any economic or other terms of a potential transaction.
Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the KnowBe4 Board’s fiduciary duties and obligations in connection with a potential sale of KnowBe4 and
discussed certain potential conflicts of interest that could arise in connection with the exploration of a potential sale. Each of Messrs. Sjouwerman, Daly
and Shanley indicated that, if Vista were interested in acquiring KnowBe4 and there was an opportunity for them to rollover equity in such transactions,
such individual or the entities that they represent (as applicable) may be interested in “rolling” all or a part of their equity interests in KnowBe4 in such a
transaction. In response to such expressions of interest, representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed the merits of forming a special committee of the
KnowBe4 Board to oversee any efforts by KnowBe4 to explore or pursue a potential sale of KnowBe4.
On July 5, 2022, the KnowBe4 Board held a special meeting by video conference with representatives of Wilson Sonsini. At the request of the KnowBe4
Board, representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an overview of, among other things, (1) the KnowBe4 Board’s fiduciary duties; (2) the potential
conflicts of interest involving members of the KnowBe4 Board with respect to a potential sale of KnowBe4, including if any of the existing significant
stockholders of KnowBe4 elected to rollover any portion of their equity in KnowBe4 in a potential transaction; (3) approaches for mitigating or
neutralizing such conflicts of interest, including creating a special committee of independent and disinterested members of the KnowBe4 Board, including
the relevance of Kahn v. M&F Worldwide Corp. and its progeny (“MFW”) to a potential transaction; (4) the disclosure obligations of a Schedule 13D
filer in the context of potential strategic discussions; and (5) an overview of Rule 13e-3 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 and its potential
application to a possible transaction. The KnowBe4 Board determined that a sale of KnowBe4 could be attractive and merited further consideration,
including as a result of general conditions in the market overall. The KnowBe4 Board determined to form the Special Committee for the purposes of
reviewing, evaluating and, if appropriate, negotiating a strategic transaction, which could involve a sale of KnowBe4. After discussion at the meeting, the
KnowBe4 Board determined that each of Gerhard Watzinger, Kevin Klausmeyer and Krish Venkataraman were independent and disinterested for purposes
of a possible transaction with Vista and appointed them to the Special Committee. The KnowBe4 Board requested additional time for consideration and
review of the scope of authority and other related matters for the Special Committee. Immediately following the completion of the KnowBe4 Board
meeting, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference to discuss the retention of legal and financial advisors to advise the Special
Committee. Members of the KnowBe4 Board and representatives of Wilson Sonsini also attended this meeting. The Special Committee determined to
contact the representatives of Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP (“Potter Anderson”) and Morgan Stanley to ask each advisor to interview with the
Special Committee to serve as the Special Committee’s independent legal advisor and financial advisor, respectively. The Special Committee did not seek
to interview any other advisors at this time.
On July 7, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of Potter Anderson to interview Potter Anderson to serve
as its independent legal advisor and to discuss the Special Committee’s process. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also attended a portion of the
meeting to interview to serve as the Special Committee’s independent financial advisor and to discuss the Special
 
29
Table of Contents
Committee’s process. Representatives of Potter Anderson provided the Special Committee with an overview of a number of process-related matters,
including discussing the scope of the Special Committee’s expected mandate, the relevance of MFW to a potential transaction, and the engagement of an
independent financial advisor to advise the Special Committee. Representatives of Potter Anderson also reviewed Potter Anderson’s independence and
qualifications, experience and expertise. Representatives of Morgan Stanley joined the meeting and provided the Special Committee with an overview of
Morgan Stanley’s independence and qualifications, experience and expertise, including with respect to serving as a financial advisor to technology,
cybersecurity and software companies, advising companies on M&A transactions and serving as an independent financial advisor to special committees
of boards of directors. Following Morgan Stanley’s departure from the meeting, the Special Committee discussed Morgan Stanley’s qualifications,
experience and expertise, Morgan Stanley’s prior experience in serving as an advisor to KnowBe4, and its earlier discussions with Morgan Stanley at the
meeting. Following such discussion, the Special Committee determined to engage Morgan Stanley, subject to (1) receipt of Morgan Stanley’s
relationships disclosure memorandum and the Special Committee’s satisfaction with the independence of Morgan Stanley; and (2) the negotiation of a
mutually acceptable engagement letter. Given Morgan Stanley’s experience, expertise and qualifications and familiarity with KnowBe4, the Special
Committee determined not to interview other potential financial advisors.
Following this meeting, the Special Committee also determined to engage Potter Anderson as its independent legal advisor and an engagement letter with
Potter Anderson was executed on July 7, 2022.
On July 11, 2022, the KnowBe4 Board adopted, by unanimous written consent, resolutions setting forth the formal delineation of the scope of the
KnowBe4 Board’s delegation of authority to the Special Committee which empowered the Special Committee to, among other things, review, evaluate and
negotiate the structure, form, terms and conditions of (1) a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 and (2) any potential acquisition of KnowBe4 that included a
transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 may have an interest that is in addition to, and/or
different from, the interests of KnowBe4’s stockholders as a whole (such a transaction, a “Specified Transaction”). The resolutions provided that the
KnowBe4 Board would not approve, or recommend for approval by KnowBe4’s stockholders, a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 or a Specified
Transaction without a prior favorable recommendation by the Special Committee. The resolutions further provided that the Special Committee had the
authority to select and engage its own advisors and that KnowBe4 would not effectuate a Specified Transaction unless it had first been approved or
recommended by the Special Committee and approved by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 held by
the disinterested stockholders (as determined by the Special Committee). Finally, the resolutions provided that the Chairperson of the Special Committee
would be Mr. Watzinger, who would receive compensation of $39,000 per month, and the other members of the Special Committee would receive
compensation of $36,000 per month, with such amounts payable regardless of the determinations reached by the Special Committee and in no way
contingent on the Special Committee approving or recommending a potential transaction.
On July 12, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered Morgan Stanley’s customary relationships disclosures memorandum to the Special
Committee, which provided an overview of Morgan Stanley’s relationships (or lack thereof) with KnowBe4, Vista and certain of its affiliates, KKR and
certain of its affiliates, and Elephant Funds and certain of their affiliates.
On July 13, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of Potter Anderson. Representatives of Potter Anderson
provided the Special Committee with, among other things, an overview of (1) the Special Committee’s fiduciary duties in connection with the Special
Committee’s process and a potential sale transaction; (2) the MFW framework under Delaware law; and (3) the nature of the potential conflicts in a
Specified Transaction. Representatives of Potter Anderson conducted an additional independence review of the Special Committee members and, after
such review, the Special Committee concluded that each member was independent and disinterested for purposes of evaluating a potential acquisition of
the Company.
 
30
Table of Contents
Representatives of Potter Anderson also reviewed with the Special Committee its mandate from the KnowBe4 Board. The Special Committee and
representatives of Potter Anderson discussed certain preliminary valuation considerations involving KnowBe4 and a potential transaction, as well as
certain initial price discovery strategies and considerations. The Special Committee and representatives of Potter Anderson also reviewed Morgan
Stanley’s relationships disclosure memorandum and Morgan Stanley’s draft engagement letter. Following such review, the Special Committee determined
that no conflicts had been disclosed in Morgan Stanley’s relationship disclosure memorandum that would affect the ability of Morgan Stanley to fulfill its
responsibilities as an independent financial advisor to the Special Committee and to engage Morgan Stanley as the Special Committee’s independent
financial advisor. The Special Committee executed an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley on July 15, 2022.
On July 14, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley to
discuss certain initial process matters for the Special Committee’s consideration of a potential acquisition of the Company, including (1) an initial outreach
to representatives of Vista and the substance of the communication for such initial outreach; (2) price discovery considerations for a potential
acquisition; (3) Vista’s potential public disclosure obligations; and (4) the roles of KKR and Elephant Funds in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4,
including whether either would be interested in an independent bid for KnowBe4, whether either anticipated being a “seller-only” in a potential
acquisition, or whether either contemplated rolling some or all of their equity in a potential acquisition. In addition, the representatives of Morgan Stanley
also provided Morgan Stanley’s preliminary view as to the most likely potential strategic parties and financial sponsor acquirers of KnowBe4, which
potential acquirers were arranged in certain tiers, based on (1) Morgan Stanley’s judgment and experience; (2) the strategic fit of KnowBe4 with each
potential acquirer; and (3) the ability and likelihood of each potential acquirer to engage in, and consummate, an acquisition of KnowB4. The Special
Committee, after discussion at the meeting, authorized Morgan Stanley to have a preliminary discussion with Vista regarding Vista’s interest in acquiring
KnowBe4 and to convey to Vista that any transaction proposed by Vista in which certain significant existing stockholders of KnowBe4 would roll some
or all of their equity in KnowBe4 would have to be made subject to, and conditioned upon, the MFW framework.
Later that day, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Vista to discuss whether Vista would be interested in exploring a potential
acquisition of KnowBe4. Representatives of Vista reiterated that Vista was evaluating its existing investment in KnowBe4, and noted that it would be
open to exploratory conversations regarding a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. Vista noted that, in the case of a potential acquisition scenario, while
Vista would likely be open to exploratory discussions regarding certain stockholders of KnowBe4 rolling their equity interests in KnowBe4, if Vista
determined it was interested in pursuing a potential transaction it would not expect to condition any such possible transaction on any stockholder rolling
a specific amount of equity. The representatives of Morgan Stanley and Vista did not discuss any specific terms or valuation with respect to a potential
transaction.
On July 18, 2022, representatives of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP (“Gibson Dunn”), outside legal advisor to KKR, met with representatives of Potter
Anderson to discuss a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, during which meeting Gibson Dunn conveyed that KKR anticipated that it would be supportive
of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, subject to agreement on acceptable terms, and that under certain circumstances and subject to obtaining all
required internal approvals, KKR or its affiliates would consider maintaining an equity interest in KnowBe4 in connection with any such potential
acquisition, including in connection with a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista.
Also on July 18, 2022, representatives of Vista met with representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey that Vista wanted to have six weeks for due
diligence before Vista would be able to complete its evaluation of its existing investment in KnowBe4 and to determine, among other possibilities, whether
or not it was interested in potentially submitting a proposal to the Special Committee. Representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Vista also
discussed Vista’s public disclosure obligations and the impact of amending Vista’s existing non-disclosure
 
31
Table of Contents
agreement with KnowBe4, which was entered into on March 12, 2020 prior to the IPO, for the purposes of exploration of a possible sale or investment
transaction in connection with its diligence for its evaluation of its existing investment in KnowBe4. This non-disclosure agreement did not include a
“standstill” or other restriction on Vista’s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire KnowBe4.
Later on July 18, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley reported on their communications with Gibson Dunn and Vista, respectively.
Representatives of Potter Anderson reviewed the nature of KKR’s potential conflict of interest. Representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed certain
process and procedural matters, including the scope of an initial outreach to potential bidders other than Vista and the advantages of contacting other
potential bidders at this juncture. Representatives of Morgan Stanley recommended that the Special Committee conduct an initial, limited outreach to four
potential bidders at this time regarding a potential interest in an acquisition of KnowBe4. The initial four potential bidders contacted consisted of four
financial sponsors (including two financial sponsors that owned strategic parties to KnowBe4), which Morgan Stanley had identified as the potential
bidders that would likely have a significant level of interest in KnowBe4 and were the most likely to engage in, and complete, an acquisition of KnowBe4.
The Special Committee and its advisors discussed additional process matters, including the ramifications of any public disclosure concerning Vista’s
potential interest in acquiring KnowBe4 at this juncture and the need to work with KnowBe4 management to receive KnowBe4 management’s long-term
financial projections for KnowBe4. After discussion at the meeting, the Special Committee authorized (1) Potter Anderson to contact Wilson Sonsini to
discuss the process for approving management’s long-term financial projections and Vista’s potential public disclosure considerations; (2) Morgan
Stanley to conduct an outreach to four identified financial sponsors to gauge their respective interest in pursuing a potential acquisition of KnowBe4;
and (3) Morgan Stanley to conduct an additional outreach to Mr. Shanley to confirm KKR’s position with respect to a potential acquisition of KnowBe4.
In the days following the Special Committee meeting on July 18, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley, acting upon the authorization of the Special
Committee, conducted an outreach to the four financial sponsors previously discussed with the Special Committee. Based on the feedback and interest
received following the initial outreach to the four potential bidders and a continual evaluation of the market outreach conducted by Morgan Stanley,
including reports and updates from Morgan Stanley on the feedback received from potential bidders, the Special Committee, during its meetings on July
28, 2022 and August 4, 2022, authorized the representatives of Morgan Stanley to contact additional financial sponsors and strategic parties regarding
such sponsors’ and parties’ potential interest in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. The decision to contact those additional financial sponsors and
strategic parties at those respective times reflected recommendations from Morgan Stanley on those financial sponsors and strategic parties that would
likely have an interest in KnowBe4 and would be capable of engaging in, and completing, an acquisition of KnowBe4, albeit in a descending order of
interest in KnowBe4 and/or in capability of engaging in, and completing, an acquisition. This decision also reflected, among other things, the level of
interest shown, the engagement (or the lack thereof) by potential bidders (including by the four potential bidders initially contacted), the number of
potential bidders in the process at any given time, and that potential bidders had passed on pursuing a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 at various
junctures in the Special Committee’s process. The other potential financial sponsor and strategic party bidders passed on pursuing a potential acquisition
of KnowBe4 for, among other reasons in the aggregate, (1) questions about the ultimate size of the total available market, (2) current and future
competition, (3) challenges with respect to future growth at-scale, (4) high exposure to small and midsize business market and (5) technology content and
differentiation; (6) such bidder’s lack of a compelling rationale for an acquisition; and/or (7) such bidder’s view that it could not see itself paying a
meaningful premium in an acquisition based on KnowBe4’s current market trading price. In the aggregate, the representatives of Morgan Stanley
contacted 12 financial sponsors (not including Vista), including two financial sponsors that owned strategic parties, and four strategic parties to
determine their interest in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. Nine of the non-Vista financial sponsors contacted executed non-disclosure agreements to
allow them to engage further with KnowBe4 regarding a potential acquisition. These non-disclosure agreements included a “standstill” or other
restriction on the
 
32
Table of Contents
applicable financial sponsor’s ability to make public proposals to acquire KnowBe4 but such restrictions would fall away under certain circumstances,
including the date that KnowBe4 announces a definitive written agreement with any unaffiliated third party (or, in some cases, just a third party) to
consummate a transaction that would result in such third party obtaining a majority of the outstanding number of KnowBe4’s voting securities. However,
all of these non-disclosure agreements permitted the applicable financial sponsor to make a direct proposal to the KnowBe4 Board, provided that it was
on a confidential, non-public basis. Eight of the non-Vista financial sponsors contacted had an initial meeting with KnowBe4 management to discuss
KnowBe4’s business and operations. Two of the non-Vista financial sponsors contacted submitted additional due diligence requests on KnowBe4
following the initial management presentation, all of which were responded to by management. However, following the delivery of these responses, each
of these non-Vista financial sponsors declined to pursue a transaction and did not submit a proposal or access a virtual data room. No financial sponsors
(other than Vista) ultimately submitted a proposal for a potential acquisition. None of the strategic bidders contacted executed a non-disclosure
agreement, held an initial meeting with KnowBe4 management, conducted due diligence on KnowBe4, or submitted an acquisition proposal.
On July 21, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with Mr. Shanley, who indicated that KKR would not pursue a full acquisition of KnowBe4. Mr.
Shanley also indicated that, subject to obtaining all required internal approvals, KKR or its affiliates would consider maintaining an equity interest in
KnowBe4 in connection with a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista, but could not commit to maintaining an equity interest in KnowBe4 in
connection with any other potential acquisition of KnowBe4 without knowing the identity of the acquiror in any such transaction.
On July 24, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Wilson Sonsini also participated for a portion of the meeting to discuss (1) whether to amend Vista’s current non-disclosure
agreement; and (2) potential disclosure obligations in connection with Vista’s exploration of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. The Special Committee
authorized representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Wilson Sonsini to contact Vista’s outside legal advisor to discuss considerations with respect
to Vista’s exploration of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. Following Wilson Sonsini’s departure from the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley
provided an update on its initial outreach to the non-Vista potential bidders and reported on their discussion with Mr. Shanley concerning KKR’s views
on participation in a transaction.
On July 26, 2022, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini, Gibson Dunn and Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham”), outside legal advisor
to Elephant Funds, held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Special Committee’s process generally. The representatives of Gibson Dunn and Latham
requested that the representatives of Potter Anderson and Wilson Sonsini provide periodic updates, as determined to be appropriate by the Special
Committee, with respect to the Special Committee’s progress and transaction matters.
On July 27, 2022, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), outside legal advisor to Vista, held
an introductory meeting to discuss the process and timeline for Vista’s exploration of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4.
On July 28, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an overview of certain process matters for a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, including a process timeline
for potential bidders, including Vista. The Special Committee and representatives of Potter Anderson also discussed considerations related to Vista’s
public disclosure obligations, as informed by discussions with Wilson Sonsini, given Vista’s existing Schedule 13D filing. The Special Committee and its
advisors also discussed providing periodic updates to Latham and Gibson Dunn, generally, on the Special Committee’s progress and transaction matters.
After discussion of the benefits and considerations of such updates, including that the Special Committee believed that it was prudent to keep the two
largest stockholders of KnowBe4 who collectively owned a majority of the voting

power of the Company generally apprised of the Special Committee’s progress and transaction matters, the Special Committee directed Potter Anderson
to provide Latham and Gibson Dunn with periodic, general updates on the Special Committee’s process. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then (1)
provided an update on Morgan Stanley’s communications with Vista and the other four potential bidders that Morgan Stanley had contacted; (2)
discussed Morgan Stanley’s preliminary views on KnowBe4’s valuation based on historical or publicly available information; and (3) reviewed a number
of KnowBe4-specific and market-specific financial benchmarks. The Special Committee and its advisors then discussed KnowBe4’s current stock price, a
range of potential illustrative transaction prices, the implied premiums resulting from such illustrative transaction prices, and how this analysis may
impact preliminary price communications with Vista. As discussed earlier in this background section, the Special Committee, acting upon the
recommendation of Morgan Stanley, authorized the representatives of Morgan Stanley to contact an additional set of financial sponsors and a set of
strategic parties regarding their potential interest in an acquisition of KnowBe4, which such recommendation reflected Morgan Stanley’s belief that those
financial sponsors and strategic parties would likely have an interest in KnowBe4 and would be capable of engaging in, and completing, an acquisition of
KnowBe4.
Consistent with the Special Committee’s authorization, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini, Gibson Dunn and Latham held
periodic meetings throughout the Special Committee’s process to discuss, generally, the Special Committee’s progress and transaction matters. The
Special Committee also provided the KnowBe4 Board with periodic updates throughout the Special Committee’s process, which updates discussed,
generally, the Special Committee’s progress and transaction matters. In connection with these updates, the Special Committee requested that the members
of the KnowBe4 Board not have any discussions with Vista, or other potential counterparties, independently from the Special Committee.
On July 29, 2022, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland met to discuss (1) amending Vista’s existing non-disclosure
agreement with KnowBe4 in order to allow Vista to receive diligence information in connection with its evaluation of its existing investment in KnowBe4
and, among other possibilities, potential exploratory discussions with respect to an acquisition of KnowBe4, and (2) other process considerations,
including potential public disclosure obligations if Vista were to decide to pursue an acquisition, including making a proposal to acquire KnowBe4.
Representatives of Kirkland conveyed that Vista was prepared to amend its existing non-disclosure agreement to (1) provide the Special Committee with a
consent right before Vista spoke with potential sources of debt or equity financing, including discussions with existing stockholders of KnowBe4
regarding a potential rollover, for any potential acquisition; and (2) grant KnowBe4 the advance right to review and comment on any Schedule 13D filing
by Vista. The representatives of Kirkland conveyed, however, that Vista did not wish to extend the term beyond the approximately six-month period
remaining on the existing non-disclosure agreement.
Also, on July 29, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with a representative of Potter Anderson to discuss process matters
relating to an upcoming update to Mr. Sjouwerman. The Special Committee determined that it would provide Mr. Sjouwerman with (1) a high level,
process-focused overview of the Special Committee’s work to date; (2) the list of names of the financial sponsors and strategic bidders that the Special
Committee had instructed Morgan Stanley to approach; and (3) an overview of an illustrative timeline for a potential acquisition.
On August 2, 2022, a representative of Morgan Stanley contacted a representative of Vista and requested that Vista extend the term for the proposed
amendment to Vista’s non-disclosure agreement from a period of approximately six months to one year from the date it was entered into. A representative
of Vista confirmed that such request was acceptable to Vista.
On August 4, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Wilson Sonsini also attended a portion of the meeting. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reported on Potter Anderson and Wilson
Sonsini’s communications with Kirkland in respect of a possible amendment to Vista’s existing non-disclosure agreement. The Special
 
34
Table of Contents
Committee and representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed the proposed terms for the amendment, and, after discussion, the Special Committee
authorized representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Potter Anderson to draft and negotiate the amendment. The Special Committee and representatives of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini discussed the timing for holding preliminary pricing discussions, and the Special Committee noted that it wanted to
avoid unnecessary expenses and management distractions if there was not a possible deal at an attractive price. Following Wilson Sonsini’s departure
from the meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed a potential update meeting involving the Special Committee and Messrs. Shanley and
Daly. The Special Committee and its advisors further discussed the scope of the topics for that informational, update meeting and it was determined that
representatives of Morgan Stanley would also attend this meeting. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Special Committee with a process
overview, an overview of an illustrative process timeline, and a review of the potential bidders contacted. As discussed earlier in this background section,
the Special Committee, acting upon the recommendation of Morgan Stanley, authorized the representatives of Morgan Stanley to contact an additional
set of financial sponsors regarding their potential interest in an acquisition of KnowBe4, which such recommendation reflected Morgan Stanley’s belief
that those financial sponsors would likely have an interest in KnowBe4 and would be capable of engaging in, and completing, an acquisition of
KnowBe4.
On August 5, 2022, the Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with Messrs. Shanley and Daly to update them, generally, on the
Special Committee’s process and expected timeline for such process.
Also on August 5, 2022, representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland met to discuss an amendment to Vista’s existing non-
disclosure agreement with KnowBe4.
Later on August 5, 2022, KnowBe4 management provided the Special Committee with management’s draft three-year financial projections for KnowBe4
for use in connection with the Special Committee’s consideration of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (the “Management Plan”). From August 6, 2022,
through August 8, 2022, the Special Committee and members of KnowBe4 management discussed and reviewed the Management Plan. Following such
discussion and review, the Special Committee approved the Management Plan.
On August 8, 2022, the KnowBe4 Board held a special meeting by video conference with Robert Reich, Chief Financial Officer of KnowBe4, and
representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Wilson Sonsini. Mr. Watzinger provided the KnowBe4 Board with an overview of the work performed by
KnowBe4 management on the Management Plan and noted that the Special Committee had the opportunity to review and discuss the assumptions
embedded in the Management Plan with KnowBe4 management. Mr. Watzinger noted that the next step in the Special Committee’s process was to present
the Management Plan to the KnowBe4 Board for its review and, if the KnowBe4 Board was supportive of the Management Plan, then it would be
provided to Morgan Stanley and could be shared with potential bidders (including Vista) that had executed a non-disclosure agreement in connection
with a potential acquisition of KnowBe4. Members of KnowBe4 management provided an overview of the Management Plan and members of the
KnowBe4 Board asked questions and provided feedback. After discussion at the meeting, including a review of the Special Committee’s and KnowBe4
management’s recommendation, the KnowBe4 Board approved the use of the Management Plan in connection with the Special Committee’s consideration
of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, and authorized its sharing with potential bidders (including Vista) that had executed a non-disclosure agreement
and its use by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its financial analysis of KnowBe4.
Also on August 8, 2022, KnowBe4 and Vista entered into an amendment to Vista’s existing non-disclosure agreement with KnowBe4. Vista began its due
diligence discussions with KnowBe4 on this date, including for purposes of evaluating its existing investment in KnowBe4 and evaluating whether it
would potentially be interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, and held meetings with members of KnowBe4 management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley, to further understand KnowBe4’s business.
On August 11, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an informal briefing to the Special Committee on Vista’s progress and the progress of
other potential bidders.
 
35
Table of Contents
Following this briefing, on August 11, 2022, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. The Special Committee discussed the briefing that it had
received from Morgan Stanley earlier in the day and (1) reviewed Vista’s engagement in due diligence on KnowBe4; (2) discussed Morgan Stanley’s
outreach to potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4; and (3) noted that meetings had been scheduled between certain of such potential bidders
and KnowBe4 management over the next two weeks. The Special Committee also reviewed the feedback that Morgan Stanley had received from certain
potential strategic bidders regarding a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, including that, while the strategic parties had positive views of KnowBe4 and
KnowBe4’s business, they did not see a compelling rationale for acquiring the business.
On August 17, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley reported on Morgan Stanley’s outreach efforts to potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4 and reviewed
those potential bidders that remained in the process at this time and those bidders that had passed on pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4 at this time.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reported on Vista’s due diligence progress, the due diligence progress of the other potential bidders and the
status of Vista’s due diligence progress relative to other potential bidders. The Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the
feedback that Morgan Stanley had received from financial sponsors and strategic bidders, including those that had either passed on pursuing an
acquisition of KnowBe4 or had not expressed a continuing interest in pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4. The Special Committee and representatives of
Morgan Stanley discussed when in the Special Committee’s process it would be appropriate to signal the Special Committee’s general views on valuation
for a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 to potential bidders, and discussed the timing for seeking bids from potential bidders. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley also provided an update on Morgan Stanley’s work on its preliminary financial analyses of KnowBe4 and the types of financial analyses that
Morgan Stanley had considered utilizing. The Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the management presentations held to
date and certain process matters in connection therewith, including that representatives of Morgan Stanley should hold periodic meetings with Mr.
Sjouwerman to receive his input on the potential acquisition of KnowBe4.
On August 19, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley (1) provided an update on Morgan Stanley’s outreach efforts to potential bidders for a potential acquisition of
KnowBe4; (2) reviewed the due diligence progress of Vista and the other potential bidders; and (3) reviewed the feedback received from potential bidders,
including (a) certain positive attributes of KnowBe4, which were noted to be (i) growth above its peer group at greater than 35 percent year-over-year, (ii)
a highly recurring business model, (iii) strong profits, and (iv) a category leader, and (b) certain considerations regarding KnowBe4, which were noted to
be (i) questions about the ultimate size of the total available market, (ii) current and future competition, (iii) challenges with respect to future growth at-
scale, (iv) high exposure to small and midsize business market, and (iv) technology content and differentiation. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also
reviewed with the Special Committee Morgan Stanley’s preliminary financial analyses of KnowBe4, including the valuation methodologies utilized and the
value ranges produced under such methodologies. The Special Committee and its advisors also discussed whether this was the appropriate time in the
Special Committee’s process to convey the Special Committee’s views on valuation to Vista. In that regard, the Special Committee noted that the Special
Committee’s process was utilizing KnowBe4 resources and KnowBe4 management’s time, and that it would not make sense to proceed further with Vista
unless Vista was prepared to submit a proposal at a price that the Special Committee found attractive. The Special Committee discussed its views on
valuation, including that it believed that a transaction with a value in the mid-to-high $20’s per share range was appropriate for a potential acquisition of
KnowBe4 based upon, among other things, Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis and the Special Committee’s views on KnowBe4’s business, and that it
did not make sense to proceed further with Vista, given Vista’s existing knowledge of KnowBe4 and its due diligence progress at that point in time, unless
it shared a similar view to the Special Committee on valuation. After discussion at the meeting, the Special Committee authorized representatives of
Morgan Stanley to convey the Special Committee’s view and message on valuation to Vista following its meeting and to other potential bidders at the
appropriate time as determined by Morgan Stanley in its professional judgment.
 
36
Table of Contents
While other potential bidders remained in the process at this time, such bidders had shown only preliminary levels of interest in an acquisition of
KnowBe4, and no other potential bidder had shown the level of engagement that Vista had shown at this time. Therefore, no other potential bidder
received the Special Committee’s view and message on valuation at this time. No potential bidder (other than Vista) would go on to demonstrate a
significant level of engagement. As a result, the Special Committee did not believe there was any benefit to shifting its perspective on valuation with
potential bidders that had expressed only a preliminary level of interest in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (if any interest at all) and given the
potential risks to the Special Committee’s process of sharing such information, no other potential bidder received the Special Committee’s view and
message on valuation.
Later on August 19, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed to representatives of Vista the Special Committee’s view and message on
valuation. Representatives of Vista did not respond to the view and message on valuation delivered by Morgan Stanley on behalf of the Special
Committee and noted that they would need to continue to conduct diligence to determine if they were interested in pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4.
On August 26, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Vista. Representatives of Vista reported that Vista was continuing to
evaluate its investment in KnowBe4 and wished to proceed with further due diligence. Representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Vista discussed,
and were aligned, that if Vista decided to pursue an acquisition of KnowBe4, any such acquisition in which KKR and Elephant Funds were asked to roll
some or all of their equity in KnowBe4 would be subject to a non-waivable condition of approval by a “majority of the minority” of KnowBe4’s
stockholders. No response by Vista to the Special Committee’s pricing message was discussed during this meeting. Representatives of Vista noted that
Vista targeted September 9, 2022, as a date on which Vista would be able to provide further feedback to the Special Committee as to whether it was
interested in pursuing any type of transaction involving KnowBe4. Representatives of Vista conveyed that, if Vista were to determine to pursue an
acquisition and make a proposal to acquire KnowBe4, it would want approximately three weeks between the decision to move forward with an acquisition
and the execution of any definitive agreement, if an agreement could be reached, to conduct confirmatory due diligence and to engage with potential
sources of financing.
On August 26, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley reported on Morgan Stanley’s communications with Vista. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed that
Vista’s proposed time period between the decision to move forward in pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4 and the execution of any definitive agreement
could have significant benefits to KnowBe4, as any proposal submitted by Vista would be publicly filed as an amendment to Vista’s existing Schedule
13D and could be evaluated by any other potential acquirers. The Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed certain tactics that
Vista may employ in connection with submitting a proposal, and representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed an analysis of precedent Vista price
negotiations. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also provided an update on the other potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4 and noted that
no other potential bidder had expressed as much interest, or had been as active, as Vista.
On August 30, 2022, the Special Committee directed KnowBe4 management to provide Vista and its representatives with access to an electronic data room
for purposes of its continued evaluation of its investment in KnowBe4 and its continued evaluation of whether it would potentially be interested in
pursuing a potential acquisition of KnowBe4.
On September 2, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley (1) discussed Vista’s due diligence progress and the due diligence progress by certain potential bidders for an
acquisition of KnowBe4; and (2) provided an update on the other potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4, including that one bidder had recently
held an initial meeting with KnowBe4 management and another bidder had recently passed on pursuing an acquisition of KnowBe4 at this time. The
Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley
 
37
Table of Contents
discussed the anticipated timeline for the submission of an acquisition proposal by Vista and whether to expedite the work to be performed by the non-
Vista potential bidders in light of the fact that Vista had communicated that it would be able to provide feedback on September 9, 2022 as to whether it was
interested in pursuing a potential transaction. After discussion of the benefits and considerations, the Special Committee determined that it would
continue to allow each potential bidder to proceed at its own pace. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed the matters that they expected to be
set forth in any Vista acquisition proposal and reviewed certain factors that they believed would influence Vista to submit a proposal at a competitive
price.
On September 7, 2022, the representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Vista met. Representatives of Vista requested that representatives of Morgan
Stanley contact KKR and Elephant Funds to inquire into KKR’s and Elephant Funds’ views on a potential rollover of some or all of their equity in a
potential acquisition of KnowBe4 and the potential quantum for any such potential rollover. They also discussed Vista’s progress on diligence.
On September 8, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an update on the potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4, including a review of the progress of
those bidders that remained in the process (including Vista) and those bidders that had recently dropped out of the process. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley reviewed a process framework in connection with the submission of a potential acquisition proposal by Vista and discussed Vista’s request that
representatives of Morgan Stanley contact KKR and Elephant Funds on a potential rollover. The Special Committee’s advisors discussed certain
signaling effects of a significant rollover of KKR’s, Elephant Funds’ and Mr. Sjouwerman’s equity in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista and how
conveying this information in advance of Vista’s proposal or an agreement on price may impact the pricing for the transaction. After discussion at the
meeting, the Special Committee authorized an outreach to Messrs. Shanley and Daly to discuss Vista’s request of a potential equity rollover and the
potential quantum of such rollover by KKR and Elephant Funds in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also
previewed Morgan Stanley’s preliminary financial analyses, including that Morgan Stanley had included extrapolations of the Management Plan to 10
years for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis and that KnowBe4 management had approved such extrapolations. Representatives of Potter
Anderson also discussed the drafting process for the merger agreement for a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 and Potter Anderson’s recommendation
that the draft did not need to include a go-shop provision, given the Special Committee’s active pre-signing market check and the anticipated passive pre-
signing market check between the submission of a Vista proposal and the execution of any definitive agreement for a potential acquisition, if any.
On September 9, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Vista discussed Vista’s progress on due diligence, certain process and timing matters, the
meeting between KnowBe4 management and Vista, and Vista’s plan to hold an internal investment committee meeting the following week to discuss the
diligence conducted so far, its evaluation of its existing investment in KnowBe4 and exploratory conversations that had taken place with respect to a
potential transaction involving KnowBe4.
On September 13, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley held separate meetings with Messrs. Shanley and Daly to discuss KKR’s and Elephant Funds’
potential interest in an equity rollover in connection with a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista and the potential quantum of such equity rollover.
Following such meetings, representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed such interest and potential quantum to representatives of Vista.
On September 15, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley (1) provided an update on the remaining potential bidders for an acquisition of KnowBe4; and (2) reported on their
communications with representatives of KKR and Elephant Funds regarding their preliminary interest in a potential rollover in connection with a potential
acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista and the potential quantum for such equity rollover, which the Special Committee and its advisors then discussed. The
Special Committee and its advisors also discussed the possibility of receiving a proposal from Vista and strategies and tactics with respect to the
negotiations with Vista if such a proposal were received. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also provided the
 
38
Table of Contents
Special Committee with an overview of Morgan Stanley’s market outreach to date, including that (1) Morgan Stanley, at the Special Committee’s direction,
had contacted all of the financial sponsors and strategic parties identified in its highest tiers as bidders that were likely to have an interest in KnowBe4
and had the capability to engage in, and complete, an acquisition of KnowBe4, (2) Morgan Stanley believed that it had contacted the most likely bidders
for a potential acquisition of KnowBe4, (3) it was not necessary to contact certain identified financial sponsor and strategic parties that were on Morgan
Stanley’s lower tiers given the market outreach and feedback received, and (4) any additional parties would be able to contact KnowBe4, the Special
Committee and their respective advisors following the public announcement of a proposal from Vista if they were interested in pursuing an acquisition.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Special Committee Morgan Stanley’s preliminary financial analyses of KnowBe4, including the
valuation methodologies utilized and the value ranges produced under such valuation methodologies. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed
certain illustrative scenarios with respect to a potential rollover of some or all of the equity interests held by Vista, KKR, Elephant Funds, Mr.
Sjouwerman, and Lars Letonoff, Co-President and Chief Revenue Officer of KnowBe4, in a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista and discussed
these scenarios with the Special Committee.
On September 16, 2022, representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Vista held a meeting by video conference, during which Vista verbally conveyed
its intention to submit a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of KnowBe4 for cash consideration of $24.00 per share (the
“Proposal”). The Proposal also reflected that Vista had not yet spoken with debt or equity financing sources and was conditioned on satisfactory
completion of those discussions. The Proposal further reflected that Vista was open to certain of KnowBe4’s significant stockholders rolling over a
portion of their current investment and, to the extent applicable as a result of their doing so, Vista would expect the transaction to be expressly
conditioned on the MFW framework. During this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed to Vista that the pricing in the Proposal fell
outside the pricing guidance that the Special Committee, through Morgan Stanley, had previously provided to Vista. Representatives of Vista later
submitted the Proposal in a written letter to the Special Committee.
On September 17, 2022, representatives of Vista provided representatives of Morgan Stanley with a list of debt and equity financing sources and sought
the Special Committee’s approval to contact such financing sources. Representatives of Vista also requested the Special Committee’s approval to contact
Elephant Funds, KKR and Mr. Sjouwerman regarding a potential rollover of their equity in a potential transaction.
Later on September 17, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan
Stanley. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reported on their meeting with Vista and provided an overview of the Proposal. The Special Committee and
representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed certain process matters in connection with the Special Committee’s receipt of the Proposal, including
KnowBe4’s public response to such Proposal and the due diligence requests submitted by a representative of KKR to KnowBe4 management in
connection with a potential equity co-investment with Vista in the potential transaction. The Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley
also discussed (1) potential responses to the Proposal; (2) soliciting feedback from KKR, Mr. Sjouwerman and Elephant Funds on the Proposal; and (3)
potential communications between or among Vista, KKR and/or Elephant Funds regarding a potential rollover of some or all of their equity in connection
with the Proposal. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed certain potential risks with respect to unchaperoned communications between or
among Vista and KKR, and/or Elephant Funds regarding a potential rollover at this juncture in the Special Committee’s negotiations. After discussions of
potential responses, the Special Committee determined to submit a verbal counterproposal to Vista that would have Vista acquire KnowBe4 for cash
consideration of $26.50 per share, provided guidance on the timing for a response, and authorized Morgan Stanley to make that counterproposal. The
Special Committee and representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed Vista’s proposed list of debt and equity financing sources, and, after discussion, the
Special Committee authorized Morgan Stanley to convey that Vista should reduce its proposed list of equity financing sources to contact at this time.
The Special Committee and its advisors also discussed the proposed “majority-of-the-minority” stockholder voting condition and certain matters
 
39

in connection with seeking and securing such vote. The Special Committee authorized representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss the Proposal with
Messrs. Sjouwerman, Shanley and Daly. The Special Committee and its representatives also discussed a potential retention bonus pool for members of

and Mr. Daly.
In addition, on September 17, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered the Special Committee’s counterproposal to Vista.

Representatives of Morgan Stanley (1) reported on their meeting with Vista and Vista’s process for responding to the Special Committee’s
counterproposal on price; and (2) confirmed with the Special Committee that it had the authority to convey the Special Committee’s written approval of
Vista’s outreach to certain identified potential sources of debt financing to Vista. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reported on Morgan Stanley’s
communications with Mr. Shanley, including that Mr. Shanley with the representatives of Morgan Stanley that KKR would need to perform due diligence
on KnowBe4 in connection with a potential equity co-investment with Vista. Representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed that Vista had requested the
Special Committee’s approval to speak with representatives of KKR and Elephant Funds regarding the Proposal. The Special Committee and its advisors
discussed potential communications between or among Vista and KKR and/or Elephant Funds regarding the Proposal and a range of process guardrails
in connection therewith. After discussion, the Special Committee determined that any communications between or among Vista and KKR and/or Elephant
Funds would also need to include representatives of Morgan Stanley for the time being and authorized representatives of Morgan Stanley to inform the
parties that the parties were not to discuss pricing for Vista’s proposed acquisition of KnowBe4 in any discussions held between the parties at that time
until the Special Committee and Vista reached a preliminary agreement on pricing.
Also on September 18, 2022, representatives of Vista and Morgan Stanley held a meeting, during which Vista conveyed that it had, per the Special
Committee’s request, proposed a more limited set of potential equity financing sources for Vista’s outreach and sought the Special Committee’s approval
to contact such parties. Representatives of Vista again requested the approval of the Special Committee to contact representatives of Elephant Funds,
KKR and Mr. Sjouwerman regarding a potential rollover of their equity in a potential transaction.

communications for the time being.

On September 20, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke, separately, with representatives of KKR, Vista and Elephant Funds. In response to a
request to remove the chaperone restrictions at that time, the representatives of Morgan Stanley reiterated to KKR and Elephant Funds that, at the
instruction of the Special Committee, until the Special Committee and Vista reached a preliminary agreement on pricing, KKR and Elephant Funds were not
permitted to discuss pricing for an acquisition of KnowBe4. Each of KKR and Elephant Funds agreed to continue abiding by the chaperone restrictions
until such conditions were met. Representatives of Vista conveyed to Morgan Stanley that Vista would expect Elephant Funds, KKR and Mr. Sjouwerman
to enter into support agreements in connection with Vista’s potential acquisition of KnowBe4, and the representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed to
Vista the same message that Morgan Stanley had conveyed to KKR and Elephant Funds.
On September 22, 2022, representatives of Vista, KKR and Morgan Stanley met to discuss the Proposal and KKR’s role, if any, with respect to the
Proposal.
On September 23, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Vista met to discuss a potential response from Vista to the Special Committee’s
counterproposal. Representatives of Vista indicated that Vista would need more time to respond to the Special Committee’s counterproposal.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Vista also discussed certain transaction matters, including Vista’s financing progress, Vista’s due diligence
progress and the potential timing for a public announcement of an agreed-upon transaction if the parties were able to reach agreement on terms.
On September 25, 2022, representatives of Potter Anderson distributed an initial draft of the merger agreement to Kirkland.
On September 28, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of Potter Anderson. Representatives of Wilson
Sonsini attended a portion of the meeting. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an overview of the draft merger agreement. Following Wilson
Sonsini’s departure from the meeting, representatives of Potter Anderson discussed certain matters relating to (1) the potential voting and support
agreements for KKR, Elephant Funds and Mr. Sjouwerman and (2) the equal treatment provision for the shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock and
KnowBe4 Class B common stock in KnowBe4’s certificate of incorporation for a “Change of Control Transaction” and how that might be implicated in a
potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista that included a rollover of certain significant stockholders’ shares of Class B common stock.
Later on September 28, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Vista met to discuss Vista’s response to the Special Committee’s counterproposal.
Representatives of Vista conveyed that Vista was prepared to acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of KnowBe4 for cash consideration of
$24.60 per share (the “Revised Proposal”). Representatives of Vista indicated that it would be prepared to provide executed debt and equity commitment
letters at the time of signing of any definitive agreement for an acquisition and that the Revised Proposal reflected Vista’s expectation that certain of
KnowBe4’s significant stockholders would rollover an aggregate amount of $675 million in equity (valued at a price of $24.60 per share in cash).
Representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed to Vista that they believed that there was more work to do on the pricing for a transaction. Representatives
of Vista later distributed a written copy of the Revised Proposal to Morgan Stanley, which also reiterated that Vista expected the transaction to be
expressly conditioned on the MFW framework, as previously described in the Proposal. Representatives of Vista also orally conveyed to the
representatives of Morgan Stanley a proposal on the termination and reverse termination fees for the transaction, including that KnowBe4’s termination
fee would be set at 3.5 percent of KnowBe4’s equity value and Parent’s reverse termination fee would be set at 5.5 percent of KnowBe4’s equity value.
On September 29, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley reported on their meeting with Vista and the terms of the Revised Proposal, including that, in response to questions
from Morgan Stanley, representatives of Vista did not say that this was Vista’s best and final offer. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed a
potential counterproposal to the Revised Proposal and potential messaging for such counterproposal. The Special Committee and representatives of
Morgan Stanley also discussed the recent market
 
41
Table of Contents
volatility over the course of the Special Committee’s evaluation of a potential acquisition and that the market trading of the peer set of comparable
companies had declined. The Special Committee also considered the risks posed by this market volatility and decline in market trading for the peer set of
comparable companies when making its decision to deliver its counterproposal on price and related messaging to Vista. After discussion, the Special
Committee determined to submit a counterproposal to Vista that would have Vista acquire KnowBe4 for cash consideration of $25.75 per share, and a
message encouraging a response from Vista on pricing that went as far into the $25.00s as Vista could go. The Special Committee also determined to
submit a counterproposal, and authorized Morgan Stanley to do so, on the termination and reverse termination fees for the transaction, with the Special
Committee proposing that KnowBe4’s termination fee be set at 3.5 percent of KnowBe4’s equity value and Parent’s reverse termination fee be set at 7
percent of KnowBe4’s equity value, representing a 2x difference between the two fees. The Special Committee also authorized representatives of Morgan
Stanley to discuss with Vista the concept of a retention bonus pool for members of KnowBe4 management, which would reward members of Company
management who had assisted the Special Committee and KnowBe4 with the Special Committee’s process and incentivize such members of management
of KnowBe4 to remain with KnowBe4 and assist with executing on any agreed-upon acquisition. The Special Committee asked Morgan Stanley to request
a response on pricing from Vista that day.
Following the Special Committee meeting on September 29, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed the Special Committee’s counterproposal
to Vista and also discussed the concept of a retention bonus pool with Vista.
Later on September 29, 2022, representatives of Vista delivered a response to the Special Committee’s counterproposal, which would have Vista acquire
KnowBe4 for cash consideration of $24.80 per share. Representatives of Vista also conveyed that it (1) would not be in a position to submit a proposal at
a price of $25.00 per share or above; and (2) agreed in principle with the construct of a retention bonus pool for members of KnowBe4 management. The
representatives of Vista conveyed that they had accepted the Special Committee’s proposed 2x difference between KnowBe4’s termination fee and
Parent’s reverse termination fee but proposed, instead, that KnowB4’s termination fee be set at 3 percent of KnowBe4’s equity value and Parent’s reverse
termination fee be set at 6 percent of KnowBe4’s equity value. Representatives of Morgan Stanley asked whether this proposal represented Vista’s best
and final offer, and representatives of Vista indicated that they were reluctant to characterize the proposal as such but that Vista did not have the capacity
to make a similar increase in pricing as illustrated by their latest response on pricing.
Following the delivery of Vista’s counterproposal, the Special Committee reconvened its earlier meeting from that day by video conference with
representatives of each of Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reported on Vista’s latest response on pricing and
Morgan Stanley’s communications with Vista. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed a potential counterproposal to Vista and, after
discussion, the Special Committee authorized representatives of Morgan Stanley to deliver a counterproposal to Vista at $24.90 per share in cash. The
Special Committee also instructed that, assuming that an agreement on pricing could be reached, the Special Committee was supportive of releasing the
chaperone restrictions, which would allow direct discussions among Vista, KKR, Elephant Funds, Mr. Sjouwerman and their respective representatives.
Following the end of the Special Committee’s meeting on September 29, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed the Special Committee’s
counterproposal of $24.90 per share in cash to representatives of Vista. Vista accepted such counterproposal, reiterated its prior agreement on the
concept of a bonus retention pool for KnowBe4 management, and noted that $682 million would be the required amount for an equity rollover and/or co-
investment of certain significant stockholders of KnowBe4. The representatives of Vista also proposed that KnowBe4 would reimburse Vista for fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the potential acquisition of KnowBe4 if the merger agreement was not approved by KnowBe4 stockholders.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed that the Special Committee had approved of the release of the chaperone restrictions in light of the Special
Committee and Vista reaching a preliminary agreement on pricing, which then allowed for direct discussions among Vista, KKR, Elephant Funds, Mr.
Sjouwerman and their respective representatives.

Wilson Sonsini, along with initial drafts of the limited guarantee and equity commitment letter. In the days that followed, representatives of each of
Wilson Sonsini (with input from the Special Committee and Potter Anderson) and Kirkland, on behalf of KnowBe4 and Vista, respectively, negotiated the
terms of the merger agreement, limited guarantee and equity commitment letter. Key terms of the merger agreement negotiated by the parties included (1)

terms of the respective Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements.
On October 2, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini, and
Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an overview of, and discussed with the Special Committee and its advisors, Vista’s revised
draft of the merger agreement. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reported that, following the public disclosure of Vista’s proposal to acquire KnowBe4,
Morgan Stanley had not received, and was not otherwise aware of, any inbound interest from a potential third party who was interested in acquiring
KnowBe4. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed that they had conducted a targeted outreach to certain potential strategic parties and
financial sponsors that had been previously contacted regarding a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 following the submission of Vista’s public proposal
and that those bidders had either not responded to Morgan Stanley’s outreach or had confirmed that they were not interested in pursuing an acquisition
of KnowBe4. The Special Committee gave direction to representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Potter Anderson on how to negotiate various points
in the merger agreement. The Special Committee and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley also discussed the bonus retention
pool and certain ordinary course equity grants for members of KnowBe4 management, and the Special Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to discuss
those matters with Vista.
On October 3, 2022, Vista requested the Special Committee’s permission to discuss the terms of Mr. Sjouwerman’s employment with KnowBe4 following
its acquisition by Vista. The Special Committee provided its approval for these discussions on October 4, 2022.

position in KnowBe4 or investing new capital through one or more KKR affiliates.

Beginning on October 6, 2022, and continuing through the execution of the definitive documentation, representatives of each of Potter Anderson,
Kirkland and Wilson Sonsini and, where appropriate, representatives of Gibson Dunn, Latham and Moulton Moore held regular meetings to discuss the
draft transaction documentation and other transaction matters.
On October 7, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Morgan Stanley and
Wilson Sonsini. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reported on the recent discussions with Kirkland regarding the latest draft of the merger agreement.
The Special Committee gave direction to representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Potter Anderson on how to negotiate various points in the merger
agreement. The Special Committee, its advisors and representatives of Wilson Sonsini also discussed certain matters related to the equity compensation
of KnowBe4 employees.
On October 8, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Vista to discuss the status of negotiation of the draft transaction
documentation and other related transaction matters.
On October 9, 2022, representatives of each of Kirkland, Wilson Sonsini and Potter Anderson met to discuss KnowBe4’s certificate of incorporation and
its provisions that provided for equal treatment among the shares of KnowBe4’s Class A common stock and KnowBe4’s Class B common stock in a
“Change of Control Transaction,” unless such equal treatment was approved by the holders of KnowBe4’s Class A common stock and KnowBe4’s Class
B common stock, each voting separately as a class. Given the contemplated rollover by certain significant stockholders, representatives of Kirkland
proposed that the transaction, in addition to the majority of the minority voting standard and the required statutory stockholder voting standard, include
separate class votes of KnowBe4’s Class A common stock and KnowBe4’s Class B common stock. Representatives of Kirkland conveyed that Vista
proposed that, prior to the record date for the KnowBe4 stockholder vote, (1) Vista would irrevocably “down-convert” all of its shares of KnowBe4’s
Class B common stock into shares of KnowBe4’s Class A common stock; and (2) that Vista would request that each of the rollover stockholders also
down-convert shares of KnowBe4’s Class B common stock that they would rollover in the transaction or a commensurate amount of shares equal to the
value that such rollover stockholder expected to invest in KnowBe4 in connection with the transaction with Vista. The proposed down-converts by Vista,
KKR, Mr. Sjouwerman and Elephant Funds would result in those holders having a higher percentage of the Class A common stock than they held before
such time by irrevocably surrendering the superior voting rights associated with the shares of “down-converted” Class B stock. Following such down-
converts, Vista, KKR, Mr. Sjouwerman and Elephant Funds would, in the aggregate, hold approximately 36 percent of the voting power of the outstanding
shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock. The proposed down-converts by KKR, Mr. Sjouwerman and Elephant Funds would have an immaterial impact
on their respective aggregate voting power but the down-convert by Vista would cause Vista’s aggregate voting power to decrease from approximately
14.9 percent of KnowBe4’s voting power to approximately three percent.
On October 10, 2022, representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Vista met to discuss certain outstanding transaction items, including certain
outstanding economic points in the Merger Agreement related to the expense reimbursement provision and certain potential cost of living adjustments
and Vista’s views on such points.
Also on October 10, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Morgan Stanley
and Wilson Sonsini. Representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley reported on their communications with representatives of each of
Kirkland and Vista, respectively, regarding open points in the draft documentation for the transaction. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini also discussed
the latest drafts of the transaction documentation and the negotiation of certain matters in those documents. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then
provided the Special Committee with a presentation on Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses, including the methodologies utilized and the value ranges
produced under such methodologies. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed, among other things, the rationale for KnowBe4 entering into the
transaction with Vista and the outreach conducted by Morgan Stanley to date in support of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4.

On October 11, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Morgan Stanley and
Wilson Sonsini. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reported on the latest transaction matters and the negotiations of the draft transaction documents. At
the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered Morgan Stanley’s oral fairness opinion, which was later confirmed in
writing, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various matters, limitations, qualifications and assumptions
set forth in the opinion, the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of KnowBe4 Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded
Shares (as defined in the opinion) and the Rollover Stockholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders of shares of KnowBe4 Common Stock. Morgan Stanley’s opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement titled “—
Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.” Representatives of Morgan Stanley also confirmed that it had no material updates to its prior relationships
disclosure memorandum that it had issued to the Special Committee on July 12, 2022. Representatives of Potter Anderson reviewed the form of Special
Committee resolutions that had been previously circulated to the Special Committee, and, after discussion at the meeting, the Special Committee
unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the
Unaffiliated Stockholders; (2) recommended that the KnowBe4 Board approve the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the
Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and determine that the Merger Agreement, the
Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger,
are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders; and (3) recommended that, subject to the approval of the
KnowBe4 Board, the KnowBe4 Board submit the Merger Agreement to KnowBe4’s stockholders for their adoption and approval and recommend that
KnowBe4’s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.
Following the Special Committee meeting on October 11, 2022, the KnowBe4 Board held a special meeting by video conference with representatives of
each of Wilson Sonsini, Potter Anderson and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Watzinger provided an overview of the Special Committee’s process and
recommendation to the KnowBe4 Board. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an overview of the transaction documents for the acquisition and
the material terms therein. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an overview of the Special Committee’s outreach to financial sponsor and
strategic potential bidders and reviewed that Morgan Stanley had rendered an oral fairness opinion to the Special Committee. Representatives of Wilson
Sonsini also provided a review of the KnowBe4 Board’s fiduciary duties and the MFW framework. After discussion at the meeting, the KnowBe4 Board
unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and its
stockholders, including the Unaffiliated Stockholders; (2) approved the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited
Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger; and (3) recommended that KnowBe4’s stockholders vote
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.
Later on October 11, 2022, following the meeting of the KnowBe4 Board, Vista and KnowBe4 signed the merger agreement and the other transaction
documents. The Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements were also signed.
On October 12, 2022, KnowBe4 issued a press release announcing the transaction with Vista.
On December 15, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by video conference with representatives of each of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and
Morgan Stanley present. Representatives of Potter Anderson, Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley updated the Special Committee on the transaction
status. In addition, for the sake of completeness, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed with the Special Committee that the Company’s
preliminary proxy statement filed on November 14, 2022 disclosed that Morgan Stanley had received aggregate fees of approximately $120 to $140 million
in the two years prior to the date of its opinion for financial advisory
 
45
Table of Contents
and financing services provided to the Vista Related Entities, which was approximately $80 million higher than such fees disclosed in the Morgan Stanley
relationships disclosure memorandum delivered to the Special Committee on July 12, 2022. Morgan Stanley explained that the difference was attributable
to the fact that the July 12 relationships disclosure memorandum only reflects fees received with respect to entities that are majority-controlled affiliates
or portfolio companies of Vista as of the date of disclosure as expressly set forth therein (and also did not include pending transactions), whereas the
proxy statement includes fees that were received by Morgan Stanley from majority-controlled affiliates or portfolio companies of Vista during the two
years prior to the date of its fairness opinion, including affiliates or portfolio companies of Vista that were no longer majority-controlled affiliates or
portfolio companies of Vista as of the date of disclosure. Following Morgan Stanley’s departure from the meeting, the Special Committee, following
discussion, confirmed that such fees did not change its view that Morgan Stanley was able to fulfill its responsibilities as an independent financial
advisor to the Special Committee.

Recommendation of the Special Committee
In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, the Special Committee consulted with its independent financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, and its
independent legal advisor, Potter Anderson, and, where appropriate, with members of KnowBe4 management and Wilson Sonsini, in its capacity as
KnowBe4’s outside legal advisor. The Special Committee unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support
Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and
in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders. In addition, the Special Committee believes that the Merger is fair to KnowBe4’s
“unaffiliated security holders,” as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act (the “unaffiliated security holders”).
The Special Committee also unanimously recommended that the KnowBe4 Board:
 
•
approve the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger;
 
•
determine that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the
Unaffiliated Stockholders; and
 
•
subject to approval by the KnowBe4 Board, submit the Merger Agreement to our stockholders for their adoption and approval and
recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance with
the DGCL.
In the course of reaching its determination and making its recommendations, the Special Committee considered the following non-exhaustive list of
material factors, which are not presented in any relative order of importance and each of which the Special Committee viewed as being generally
supportive of its determination and recommendations to the KnowBe4 Board:
 
•
Potential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Special Committee that none of the possible alternatives to the Merger (including
continuing to operate KnowBe4 as an independent company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of
those alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to our stockholders of those alternatives and the timing and likelihood of
effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for KnowBe4 to create greater value for our
stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business, financial, industry, competitive and regulatory risks.
 
•
Outcome of Strategic Pre-Signing Market Check. At the direction of the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley conducted a pre-signing
market check by contacting thirteen (13) financial sponsors, including
 
46Table of Contents
Vista and two (2) financial sponsors that owned strategic parties, and four (4) strategic parties to gauge their interest in a potential
acquisition of KnowBe4. No party contacted, other than Vista, submitted a proposal or an indication of interest to acquire KnowBe4.
Further, the Special Committee considered that the time period between the announcement of Vista’s public proposal and the execution of
definitive agreement with Vista acted as a passive pre-signing market check. KnowBe4, the Special Committee and their respective advisors
did not receive any third-party proposals or indications of interests during this time period, despite public awareness of a proposal from
Vista.
 
•
Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the Merger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty
of value and immediate liquidity at an attractive price measured against the ongoing business and financial execution risks of KnowBe4’s
business plan and its continued operations as an independent company and allows our stockholders to realize that value immediately upon
the consummation of the Merger. In that regard, the Special Committee noted that the amount of cash to be received for each outstanding
share of KnowBe4 common stock is fixed and will not be reduced if the share price of KnowBe4 common stock declines prior to the effective
time of the Merger.
 
•
Best Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Special Committee that the per share price represented Vista’s best and final offer and
the best value that KnowBe4 could reasonably obtain from Vista for the shares of KnowBe4 common stock, taking into account (1) Vista’s
statements and reputation; (2) the Special Committee’s assessment that other parties did not have the interest in, or capability to, acquire
KnowBe4, including based on the regulatory, financing and other execution risks applicable to each party; and (3) the Special Committee’s
familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of KnowBe4 on a
historical and prospective basis and its assessment of associated risks, including execution risks with respect to KnowBe4’s business plan.
In forming this belief, the Special Committee also considered that (1) Vista was the only party out of 17 potential parties contacted to submit
a proposal; (2) no other third party bidder submitted a proposal during this period to acquire KnowBe4, despite ample opportunity to do so;
and (3) the Special Committee received feedback from certain potential third party bidders for a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 that such
bidders could not see themselves paying a meaningful premium to the current market price of KnowBe4. The Special Committee believed
that, after negotiations at the direction of the Special Committee and with the assistance of experienced independent legal and financial
advisors, the Special Committee obtained the best terms and highest price that Vista was willing to pay for KnowBe4, pursuant to a
thorough process and that further negotiations would have created a risk of causing Vista to abandon the Merger altogether or materially
delay the entry into definitive transaction agreements with respect to the Merger. In addition, the Special Committee believed that, measured
against the longer-term execution risks described above, the per share price reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of KnowBe4
common stock. The Special Committee also considered that the per share price constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 44 percent to the
closing price of KnowBe4 common stock of $17.30 per share on September 16, 2022, which was the last full trading day before Vista publicly
disclosed its initial non-binding acquisition proposal; and (2) a premium of approximately 30 percent to KnowBe4’s 30-day trading average
closing stock price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock of $19.10 per share ending on September 16, 2022.
 
•
Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Prospects of KnowBe4; Risks of Execution. The current, historical and projected financial
condition, results of operations and business of KnowBe4, as well as KnowBe4’s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent
company. In particular, the Special Committee considered KnowBe4’s then-current business plan, including management’s then-current
estimated projections of KnowBe4’s financial prospects, as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. As part of this, the
Special Committee considered KnowBe4’s current business plan and the potential opportunities and risks that it presented against, among
other things, various execution, operational and other risks to achieving the business plan and related uncertainties, including: (1) the
impact of market, customer and competitive trends on KnowBe4;
 
47
Table of Contents
(2) the likelihood that the business plan could be achieved in the face of operational and execution risks, including loss of market share,
customer dissatisfaction or employee attrition; and (3) general risks related to market conditions that could negatively impact our valuation
or reduce the price of KnowBe4 common stock. In particular, the Special Committee considered the likelihood and timing of, and risks to,
achieving the operational improvements, objectives and market share capture assumptions underlying the business plan, as well as the
estimated projections of KnowBe4’s financial prospects, all as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.
 
○
Among the potential risks identified by the Special Committee were: KnowBe4’s competitive positioning and prospects as an
independent company. Included among these risks were consideration of (1) KnowBe4’s size, as well as its financial resources,
relative to those of its competitors; (2) new and evolving competitive threats; (3) changes in the industry in which KnowBe4
operates; (4) the substantial risks to achieving KnowBe4’s business plan; and (5) the ultimate size of the total available market for
KnowBe4’s business.
 
○
The Special Committee also considered the challenges of a public company in making investments, operational changes, and
improvements (including meaningful cost reductions) to achieve long-term growth and profitability. The Special Committee was aware
that such investments, changes and improvements could lead to disruption in our performance and expose us to scrutiny based on
our quarter-over-quarter operational and financial metrics and results. The Special Committee was also aware that the price of
KnowBe4 common stock could be negatively impacted if we failed to meet investor expectations, including if we failed to meet our
growth and profitability objectives.
 
•
Opinion of Morgan Stanley. The oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Special Committee, subsequently confirmed by delivery of
its written opinion, dated October 11, 2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various matters, limitations,
qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of KnowBe4 common stock (other than
the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Stockholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders of KnowBe4 common stock. The opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Special Factors—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC” and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to
this proxy statement.
 
•
Negotiations with Parent and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the Merger Agreement, which was the product of arm’s-length
negotiations, and the belief of the Special Committee that the Merger Agreement contained terms and conditions that provided the Special
Committee with a high level of closing certainty. The factors considered included:
 
○
KnowBe4’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties submitting
unsolicited takeover proposals.
 
○
The Special Committee’s belief that the terms of the Merger Agreement would be unlikely to deter third parties from making a superior
proposal.
 
○
The ability of the KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, and the Special Committee’s ability, in
each case under certain circumstances, to change, withdraw or modify the recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement.
 
○
The KnowBe4 Board’s ability, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, under certain circumstances, to terminate
the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal. In that regard, the Special Committee
believed that the termination fee payable by KnowBe4 in such instance was reasonable, consistent with or below similar fees payable
in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.
 
48
Table of Contents
○
The limited conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, making the Merger reasonably likely to be consummated.
 
○
The reverse termination fee of $276 million payable by Parent in certain circumstances, our ability to specifically enforce Parent’s
obligations under the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and to cause the equity financing to be funded if the conditions
to closing are satisfied and the debt financing is available, and the other remedies available to KnowBe4 under the Merger
Agreement, including monetary damages. The Special Committee also considered the terms of the Limited Guarantees, which
guarantee payment of the reverse termination fee.
 
○
The Special Committee also considered the terms of the (1) the Debt Commitment Letter, which commits the debt sources to lend a
portion of the amounts needed by Parent to fund the transaction; and (2) the Equity Commitment Letters, which commit the
Guarantors and the KKR Investor to invest the balance of the amounts needed by Parent to fund the transaction (including
KnowBe4’s third-party beneficiary rights to enforce the Guarantors’ and the KKR Investor’s equity commitments under the Equity
Commitment Letters in accordance with their terms and the terms of the Merger Agreement).
 
○
The terms of the Merger Agreement provide KnowBe4 with sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary
course until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement.
 
•
Reasonable Likelihood of Consummation. The belief of the Special Committee that an acquisition by Parent has a reasonable likelihood of
closing, including that there were no anticipated substantive issues expected in connection with the required regulatory approvals. In that
regard, the Special Committee considered Vista’s business reputation and financial resources, as well as those of Parent’s debt financing
sources, all of which the Special Committee believed increased the likelihood that the required debt and equity financing for the Merger
would be available.
 
•
Appraisal Rights. KnowBe4’s stockholders have the right to exercise their statutory appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and
receive payment of the fair value of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock in lieu of the Per Share Price, subject to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the DGCL, unless and until any such KnowBe4 stockholder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such holder’s rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL.
 
•
Current and Historical Market Prices. The current and historical market prices of KnowBe4’s Class A common stock, including as set forth
in the table under “Important Information Regarding KnowBe4—Market Price of KnowBe4 Class A Common Stock” and “Special
Factors—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC” taking into account the market performance of KnowBe4’s Class A common stock
relative to the capital stock of other participants in the industries in which KnowBe4 operates and general market indices.
The Special Committee also considered a number of factors relating to the procedural safeguards that it believes were and are present to ensure the
fairness of the Merger and to permit the Special Committee to represent effectively the interests of the Unaffiliated Stockholders and the unaffiliated
security holders of KnowBe4. In the light of such procedural safeguards, the Special Committee did not consider it necessary to retain an unaffiliated
representative to act solely on behalf of the Unaffiliated Stockholders and the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 for purposes of negotiating the
terms of the Merger Agreement or preparing a report concerning the fairness of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. The Special Committee believes
these factors support its determinations and recommendations and provide assurance of the procedural fairness of the Merger to the Unaffiliated
Stockholders and the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4:
 
•
Independence. The Special Committee, since its formation, has consisted solely of independent (for purposes of serving on the Special
Committee) and disinterested directors that are not affiliated with, and are independent of, any of the potential counterparties to a potential
acquisition of KnowBe4
 
49
Table of Contents
(including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 that has a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders
of KnowBe4 have an interest that is in addition to, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4’s stockholders as a whole) and were
otherwise disinterested and independent with respect to a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4
that has a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 have an interest that is in
addition to, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4’s stockholders as a whole), other than as discussed in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Special Factors—Interests of KnowBe4’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”;
 
•
Negotiating Authority. The authority granted to the Special Committee by the KnowBe4 Board to, among other things, (1) review, evaluate
and negotiate the structure, form, terms and conditions of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4
that has a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 have an interest that is in addition
to, and/or different from, the interests of the KnowBe4’s stockholders as a whole) and the form, terms and conditions of any definitive
agreements or documents in connection therewith, (2) to determine not to proceed with any such process, procedures, review or evaluation,
and (3) to consider and evaluate any alternative transactions.
 
•
Active Involvement and Oversight. The numerous meetings held by the Special Committee to discuss and evaluate, among other things, the
Special Committee’s pre-signing market check and the proposals from Vista, and the Special Committee’s active oversight of the negotiation
process. The Special Committee was actively engaged in this process on a regular basis and was provided with full access to KnowBe4
management and its advisors in connection with the evaluation process.
 
•
Independent Advice. The Special Committee selected and engaged its own independent legal and financial advisors and received the advice
of such advisors throughout its review, evaluation and negotiation of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4.
 
•
Full Knowledge. The Special Committee made its evaluation of a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 by Vista based upon the factors
discussed in this proxy statement and with the full knowledge of the interests of the Rollover Stockholders.
 
•
No Obligation to Recommend. The recognition by the Special Committee that it had no obligation to recommend to the KnowBe4 Board the
approval of the Merger or any other transaction and had the authority to reject any proposals made.
 
•
Prior Special Committee Action. The KnowBe4 Board was not permitted to approve any potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a
potential acquisition of KnowBe4 that also included a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of
KnowBe4 had an interest that was in addition to, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4’s stockholders as a whole) or recommend
for approval any such transactions by KnowBe4’s stockholders without a prior favorable recommendation of the transaction by the Special
Committee.
 
•
Communication Safeguards. The Special Committee requested that the Rollover Stockholders and their representatives not engage in
direct, unchaperoned discussions with Vista and its representatives on the Rollover until after the Special Committee and the
representatives of Vista had reached a preliminary agreement on pricing for the transaction and the Special Committee expressly authorized
the Rollover Stockholders to have such discussions. The Rollover Stockholders and their representatives abided by the Special
Committee’s request and did not have direct, unchaperoned discussions with Vista and its representatives until such events occurred.
 
•
Additional Procedural Safeguards. The KnowBe4 Board, in its authorizing resolutions for the Special Committee, determined that KnowBe4
would not effectuate an acquisition of KnowBe4 that included a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant
stockholders of KnowBe4 had an interest that is in addition to, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4’s stockholders as a whole,
unless it had been (1) approved or recommended by the Special Committee and (2) approved by
 
50
Table of Contents
holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company held by disinterested stockholders (as determined by
the Special Committee).
 
•
Majority of the Minority Approval. The consummation of the Merger requires the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote, which requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a
single class) held by the Unaffiliated Stockholders and entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement.
In the course of reaching its determinations and making its recommendations, the Special Committee also considered the following non-exhaustive list of
countervailing factors concerning the Merger Agreement and the Merger, which are not presented in any relative order of importance:
 
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the Merger as a cash transaction means that our stockholders
(other than the Rollover Stockholders) will not participate in KnowBe4’s future earnings or growth and will not benefit from any
appreciation in value of the surviving corporation. The Special Committee considered the other potential alternative strategies available to
KnowBe4 as an independent company, which, despite significant uncertainty, had the potential to result in a more successful and valuable
company.
 
•
No-Shop Restrictions. The restrictions in the Merger Agreement on KnowBe4’s ability to solicit competing transactions (subject to certain
exceptions to allow the KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, or the Special Committee, to exercise
their respective fiduciary duties and, in the case of KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, to accept a
superior proposal, and then only upon the payment of a termination fee). The Special Committee was also aware that Vista’s indirect
ownership interest in KnowBe4 (through the VEPF Funds) and the interests of the Rollover Stockholders in the Merger would likely be
considered by third parties evaluating whether to make superior proposals.
 
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the Merger might not be consummated, and if it is not
consummated, that: (1) KnowBe4’s directors, management team and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will
have experienced significant distractions from their work on behalf of KnowBe4 during the pendency of the Merger; (2) KnowBe4 will have
incurred significant transaction and other costs; (3) KnowBe4’s continuing business relationships with customers, business partners and
employees may be adversely affected; (4) the trading price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock could be adversely affected; (5) the
contractual and legal remedies available to KnowBe4 in the event of the breach or termination of the Merger Agreement may be insufficient,
costly to pursue, or both; (6) the reverse termination fee of $276 million payable by Parent to KnowBe4 will not be available in all instances
in which the Merger Agreement is terminated and such reverse termination fee may not be sufficient to compensate KnowBe4 for the
damage suffered by its business as a result of the pendency of the Merger or of the strategic initiatives forgone by KnowBe4 during this
period; and (7) the failure of the Merger to be consummated could result in an adverse perception among our customers, potential
customers, employees and investors about KnowBe4’s prospects.
 
•
Regulatory Risks. The possibility that regulatory agencies may delay, object to, challenge or seek to enjoin the Merger, or may seek to
impose terms and conditions on their approvals that are not acceptable to Parent, notwithstanding its obligations under the Merger
Agreement.
 
•
Impact of Interim Restrictions on KnowBe4’s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The restrictions on the conduct of
KnowBe4’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking strategic initiatives before
the completion of the Merger that, absent the Merger Agreement, we might have pursued, or from taking certain actions aimed at
incentivizing and retaining our employees.
 
51
Table of Contents
•
Effects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the Merger, including the: (1) effects on our employees,
customers, operating results and stock price; (2) impact on our ability to attract and retain key management, sales and marketing, and
technical personnel; and (3) potential for litigation in connection with the Merger.
 
•
Termination Fee Payable by KnowBe4. The requirement that KnowBe4 pay Parent a termination fee of $138 million under certain
circumstances following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if KnowBe4 terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior
proposal. The Special Committee considered the potentially discouraging impact that this termination fee could have on a third party’s
interest in making a competing proposal to acquire KnowBe4.
 
•
Taxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of KnowBe4 common stock in the Merger will be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes for many of our stockholders.
 
•
Interests of KnowBe4’s Directors and Executive Officers. The interests that KnowBe4’s directors and executive officers may have in the
Merger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.
 
•
Interests of Certain Significant Stockholders in the Merger. Certain significant stockholders of the KnowBe4 common stock were offered
the opportunity, and elected, to participate in an equity rollover or equity reinvestment in Vista’s potential acquisition of KnowBe4, which
such option to participate was not extended to all of KnowBe4’s stockholders. As noted in this section, these significant stockholders will
be able to participate in the future growth or earnings of the post-closing company with respect to that portion of their equity that they are
rolling over or reinvesting in the post-closing entity. However, those stockholders elected to forgo the certain value of the Per Share Price
for such rollover shares, which value the Special Committee found compelling for KnowBe4’s stockholders.
 
•
Voting Obligations of Certain Significant Stockholders. Certain significant stockholders of KnowBe4 are parties to Rollover Stockholder
Support Agreements with KnowBe4 and Parent, which, under certain circumstances, obligate such holders to vote in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement and that those obligations do not automatically terminate in the event that the KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, or the Special Committee modifies, changes or withdraws KnowBe4’s recommendation with
respect to the transaction.
 
•
Conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock. Certain significant stockholders of KnowBe4 are parties to Rollover
Stockholder Support Agreements with KnowBe4 and Parent or KnowBe4 only, which obligated such holders to convert certain amounts of
shares of KnowBe4 Class B common stock to KnowBe4 Class A common stock prior to the Record Date.
Recommendation of the KnowBe4 Board
Based on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee and on the basis of the other factors described above, the KnowBe4 Board
unanimously:
 
•
determined that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and our
stockholders, including the Unaffiliated Stockholders (and, accordingly, the “unaffiliated security holders,” as such term is defined in Rule
13e-3 under the Exchange Act);
 
•
approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger;
 
•
directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of our stockholders at a meeting of our stockholders; and
 
•
recommended that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance
with the DGCL.
 
52
Table of Contents
In addition, the KnowBe4 Board, on behalf of KnowBe4, believes, based on the factors described below, that the Merger is fair to the “unaffiliated
security holders,” as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act.
The KnowBe4 Board did not assess whether the “rollover” provisions of the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements with the Rollover Stockholders
are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Rollover Stockholders.
In the course of reaching its determination and making its recommendations, the KnowBe4 Board considered the following non-exhaustive list of material
factors and countervailing factors, which are not presented in any relative order of importance:
 
•
Determinations of the Special Committee. The Special Committee’s analysis (as to both substantive and procedural aspects of the Merger),
conclusions and unanimous determination, which the KnowBe4 Board adopted, that the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder
Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of KnowBe4 and the Unaffiliated Stockholders (and, as described in this proxy statement, the
“unaffiliated security holders,” as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act). The KnowBe4 Board also considered the Special
Committee’s unanimous recommendation that the KnowBe4 Board approve the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support
Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and, subject to
KnowBe4 Board approval, that the Board submit the Merger Agreement to the stockholders of KnowBe4 for their adoption and approval
and recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance
with the DGCL.
 
•
Procedural Protections. The procedural fairness of the Merger, including that (1) it was negotiated by the Special Committee consisting
solely of independent (for purposes of serving on the Special Committee) and disinterested directors that are not affiliated with, and are
independent of, any of the potential counterparties to a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4
that has a transaction or series of transactions in which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 have an interest that is in addition
to, and/or different from, the interests of KnowBe4’s stockholders as a whole) and were otherwise disinterested and independent with
respect to a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 (including a potential acquisition of KnowBe4 that has a transaction or series of transactions
in which one or more significant stockholders of KnowBe4 have an interest that is in addition to, and/or different from, the interests of
KnowBe4’s stockholders as a whole), other than as discussed in the section titled “Special Factors—Interests of KnowBe4’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger”; and (3) the Special Committee had the authority to select and engage, and was advised by, its own
independent legal and financial advisors;
 
•
Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote. Although consummation of the Merger does not specifically require that the Merger Agreement be adopted
by KnowBe4’s unaffiliated security holders, the Merger Agreement provides that consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon
KnowBe4 obtaining the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote. Messrs. Daly, Sjouwerman and Shanley (the “Affiliated Directors”) are not deemed
to be Unaffiliated Stockholders due to their affiliations with the Rollover Stockholders; accordingly, the shares they beneficially own will be
excluded from the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote. The directors other than the Affiliated Directors (the “Unaffiliated Directors”) are deemed
to be Unaffiliated Stockholders; accordingly, the shares they beneficially own will be counted toward the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote.
While the Unaffiliated Directors are deemed to be “affiliates” of KnowBe4 under Rule 13e-3 and thus are not deemed to be “unaffiliated
security holders,” for purposes of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee viewed the
Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote as a procedural safeguard of the interests of the unaffiliated security holders because they considered the
interests of the Unaffiliated Directors to be entirely aligned with those of the unaffiliated security holders. Specifically, following the Merger,
the Unaffiliated Directors will not retain any equity interest in KnowBe4, they will receive the same Per Share Price as the
 
53
Table of Contents
unaffiliated security holders upon consummation of the Merger, and the Unaffiliated Directors have not received any consideration beyond
the Per Share Price from any Purchaser Filing Party in connection with the Merger or entered into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding to receive any consideration from any Purchaser Filing Party in connection with the Merger. Further, as of the Record Date,
Mr. Venkataraman was the only Unaffiliated Director who held shares of KnowBe4 common stock, and his holdings represented less than
one percent of KnowBe4’s outstanding capital stock and less than one percent of the voting power of KnowBe4’s capital stock.
Accordingly, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee considered the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote as a factor in support of their
belief that the Merger is fair to KnowBe4’s unaffiliated security holders.
 
•
Other Factors Considered by the Special Committee. The other material factors and countervailing factors considered by the Special
Committee and listed above.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Special Committee and by the KnowBe4 Board is not intended to be
exhaustive and includes only the material factors considered. In the light of the variety of factors considered by the Special Committee and by the
KnowBe4 Board and the complexity of these factors, neither the Special Committee nor the KnowBe4 Board found it practicable to, and did not, quantify
or otherwise assign relative weights, ranks or values to the foregoing factors in reaching their respective determinations and recommendations.
Moreover, each member of the Special Committee and of the KnowBe4 Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may
have assigned different relative weights, ranks or values to the different factors, and the recommendations, determinations and approvals, where
applicable, by the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board were based upon the totality of the information presented to, and considered by, the
Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board, respectively.
In the course of evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, the Limited Guarantees and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and making the decisions, determinations and recommendations described above (as
applicable), the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee did not consider the liquidation value of KnowBe4 because (1) they considered KnowBe4 to
be a viable, going concern; (2) they believed that liquidation sales generally result in proceeds substantially less than sales of going concern; and (3)
they considered determining a liquidation value to be impracticable given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup of KnowBe4. For the
foregoing reasons, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee did not consider liquidation value to be a relevant factor. Further, the KnowBe4 Board
and the Special Committee did not consider KnowBe4’s net book value, which is an accounting concept, as a factor because they believe (1) that net
book value is not a material indicator of the value of KnowBe4 as a going concern but rather is indicative of historical costs and (2) net book value does
not take into account the prospects of KnowBe4, market conditions, trends in the industry in which KnowBe4 operates or the business risks inherent in
the industry. In addition, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee did not view the purchase prices paid in the transactions described in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Important Information Regarding KnowBe4—Transactions in KnowBe4 Common Stock” (all of which were
below the Per Share Price) to be relevant except to the extent that those prices indicated the trading price of the KnowBe4 Class A common stock during
the applicable periods. The KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee believe that the trading price of the shares of KnowBe4 common stock at any
given time represents the best available indicator of KnowBe4’s going concern value at that time so long as the trading price at that time is not impacted
by speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. In addition, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee implicitly considered the
value of KnowBe4 as a going concern by taking into account the value of KnowBe4’s current and anticipated business, financial condition, results of
operations, prospects, and other forward-looking matters.
Other than as described in this proxy statement, the KnowBe4 Board is not aware of any firm offer by any other person during the prior two years for (1) a
merger or consolidation of KnowBe4 with another company; (2) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of KnowBe4’s assets; or (3) a purchase of
KnowBe4’s securities that would enable such person to exercise control of KnowBe4.

Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
The Special Committee retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with the possible sale
of KnowBe4. The Special Committee selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on, among other things, Morgan Stanley’s
independence, its prior experience advising KnowBe4, and its qualifications, experience and expertise, including with respect to serving as a financial
advisor to technology, cybersecurity and software companies, advising companies on M&A transactions and serving as an independent financial
advisor to special committees of boards of directors. At the meeting of the Special Committee on October 11, 2022, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of October 11, 2022, and based upon and subject to the various matters, limitations, qualifications and
assumptions set forth in the written opinion, the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the
holders of the Excluded Shares) and the Rollover Stockholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of October 11, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the various matters,
limitations, qualifications and assumptions, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in

Committee, in its capacity as such, and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of
shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Stockholders) in the Merger pursuant to the
Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business
transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute

•
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by KnowBe4 and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With
respect to the Projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of KnowBe4’s management of the future financial performance of KnowBe4. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to such Projections or
the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set
forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions (the effect of which would be material to Morgan
Stanley’s analysis or its opinion), including among other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letters, and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft
thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other
approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material
adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor.
Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of KnowBe4 and its legal, tax or regulatory
advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any
other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley
expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of KnowBe4’s officers, directors or employees, or
any class of such persons, relative to the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the holders of
the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Stockholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent
valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of KnowBe4, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to
Morgan Stanley as of, October 11, 2022. Events occurring after October 11, 2022 may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in
preparing it, and Morgan Stanley has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its
written opinion letter, dated as of October 11, 2022, to the Special Committee. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s
opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses
described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these

Table of Contents
summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan
Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and the factors
considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s
opinion.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and was directed by the Special Committee
to rely upon, among other matters, (1) the Projections and (2) certain estimates of equity research analysts (the “Street Consensus”). The Projections are
more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” In accordance with
direction from the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley utilized the Street Consensus and the Projections in its financial analyses described below.
Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar
companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for KnowBe4 with comparable publicly available
consensus equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that share similar
business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue
growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (the “comparable companies”).
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed (1) the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue and (2) the ratio of price to estimated free
cash flow, which, in each case, for purposes of this analysis, (a) for KnowBe4, (i) was provided to Morgan Stanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley’s
use, by KnowBe4 management for calendar year 2023 and for the Projections, and (ii) was based on available consensus equity analyst research
estimates for calendar year 2023 and for the Street Consensus; and (b) for each of the comparable companies, was based on publicly available consensus
equity analyst research estimates for comparison purposes. For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined “aggregate value” as a company’s
fully diluted equity value plus total debt, less cash and cash equivalents and defined “free cash flow” as operating cash flow, less capital expenditures.
For calendar year 2023, the range of observed multiples of the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue for comparable high growth software
companies was 3.7x to 14.4x, with a median observed multiple of 6.3x. For calendar year 2023, the range of observed multiples of the ratio of aggregate
value to estimated revenue for comparable high growth security companies was 3.8x to 14.6x, with a median observed multiple of 6.9x. The following is a

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,
Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of (1) aggregate value to estimated revenue multiples and (2) price to estimated free cash flow multiples,
each for use with each of the Projections and the Street Consensus, respectively. Morgan Stanley then applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated
relevant revenue or free cash flow metric for KnowBe4, as applicable. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized publicly available financial
information, available as of October 7, 2022.
Based on the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock on a fully diluted basis and latest cash and debt balance as provided by KnowBe4
management, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of KnowBe4 common stock as follows:

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to KnowBe4. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond KnowBe4’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on KnowBe4’s business and the industry
generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of KnowBe4 and the industry, and in
the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using
comparable company data.
Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity value of a company
as a function of such company’s estimated future revenue. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied
present value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of the KnowBe4 common
stock on a standalone basis for each of the Street Consensus and Projections.
To calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized calendar year 2025 revenue estimates under each of the Street
Consensus and Projections, respectively. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied a forward
range of aggregate value to estimated revenue multiples and price to estimated free cash flow multiples (based on such multiples for the comparable
companies) to these revenue and free cash flow estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future-implied fully diluted aggregate value and equity value,
respectively. For each of the Street Consensus and Projections, Morgan Stanley applied an aggregate value to estimated revenue multiple range of 6.0x to
9.0x. For the Street Consensus, Morgan Stanley applied a price to estimated free cash flow multiple range of 30.0x to 45.0x and for the Projections, Morgan
Stanley applied a price to estimated free cash flow multiple range of 30.0x to 40.0x, each to generate an undiscounted, implied future fully diluted equity
value.
In each case, Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future fully diluted equity value to October 7, 2022, at a discount rate of 12.7 percent,
which rate was selected by Morgan Stanley based on KnowBe4’s estimated cost of equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and
utilizing a 6 percent market risk premium, a risk-free rate of 3.8 percent based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of October 7, 2022, and a 1.49 predicted
beta per Barra. The results of these analyses are listed below:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present value
of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for the
KnowBe4 common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value KnowBe4 as a standalone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the
Projections for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (burdened by stock-based compensation), less taxes and capital expenditures, and adjusted for changes in net working
capital. The Projections, for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, included extrapolations through calendar year 2032 prepared by Morgan
Stanley with the guidance of KnowBe4 management (which extrapolations were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by KnowBe4
management). The free cash flows and terminal values were discounted to present values as of October 7, 2022, at a discount rate ranging from 11.7
percent to 13.7 percent, which discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an
estimate of KnowBe4’s weighted average cost of capital estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6 percent market risk
premium, a risk-free rate of 3.8 percent based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of October 7, 2022, and a 1.49 predicted beta per Barra. To calculate
terminal values, Morgan Stanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 3.0 percent to 4.0 percent as part of its analyses, with such rates selected upon the
application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted for net debt.
Based on the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by KnowBe4’s management, Morgan Stanley calculated
the estimated implied value per share of KnowBe4 common stock as follows:

Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly available
financial terms. Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for selected software transactions. Morgan Stanley selected such comparable
transactions based on its professional judgment and experience, including because they shared certain characteristics with the Merger, most notably
because they were similar software transactions since 2014. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the multiple of aggregate value of the
transaction to the estimated next 12 months’ (“NTM”) revenue based on publicly available information at the time of announcement or at the unaffected
date of each such transaction.

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics and time frame for each of the transactions listed above and upon the application of its professional
judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of the aggregate value to the estimated NTM revenue multiples of these

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to KnowBe4 or the Merger. In evaluating the precedent
transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond KnowBe4’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on
KnowBe4’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and
prospects of KnowBe4 and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the
aggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present
value per share of KnowBe4 derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the $24.90 per share in cash to be
received by holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Stockholders) is not
necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the consideration for the Merger but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley
considered.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis with respect to its opinion but were
noted as reference data for the Special Committee, including the following information described under the sections of this proxy statement captioned “—
Illustrative Precedent Premiums,” “—Historical Trading Ranges” and “—Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets.”
Illustrative Precedent Premiums
Morgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent transactions premiums analysis by reviewing software company transactions larger than $1 billion in
aggregate value since 2014. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (1) the
implied premium to KnowBe4’s closing Class A common stock price on September 16, 2022, the last trading day prior to announcement of KnowBe4’s
receipt of an offer from Vista to acquire KnowBe4; and (2) the implied premium to KnowBe4’s unaffected 30-day average closing Class A common stock
price on September 16, 2022.
Based on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley
selected (1) a representative range of premia and applied such range to KnowBe4’s closing Class A common stock price on September 16, 2022, and (2) a
representative range of premia and applied such range to KnowBe4’s unaffected 30-day average closing Class A common stock price on September 16,

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for the KnowBe4 Class A common stock prepared and published by equity
research analysts prior to September 16, 2022. These targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of the future public market trading price of the KnowBe4
Class A common stock. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for the KnowBe4 Class A common stock was $19.00 to $28.00 per share as of
September 16, 2022. Morgan Stanley then discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for the KnowBe4 Class A common stock by one year at
a rate of 12.7 percent, which was the discount rate selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to
reflect KnowBe4’s cost of equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6 percent market risk premium, a risk-free rate of
3.8 percent based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of October 7, 2022, and a 1.49 predicted beta per Barra. This analysis indicated an implied range of
fully diluted equity values for the KnowBe4 Class A common stock of $16.85 to $24.84 per share.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the KnowBe4
Class A common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of KnowBe4 and future financial
market conditions.
Preliminary Presentations by Morgan Stanley
In addition to its October 11, 2022 opinion and October 10, 2022 presentation to the Special Committee and the underlying financial analyses performed in
relation thereto, Morgan Stanley also delivered preliminary presentation materials to the Special Committee on July 28, 2022, August 19, 2022, September
15, 2022 and September 29, 2022 (the “Preliminary Presentation Materials”). The preliminary financial considerations and other information in the
Preliminary Presentation Materials were based on information and data that was available as of the date of such respective presentation. The Preliminary
Presentation Materials substantively reflected the analyses described above under “—Summary of Financial Analyses.” Copies of such Preliminary
Presentation Materials have been filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger, will be made available for
inspection and copying at the principal executive offices of KnowBe4 during its regular business hours by any interested holder of KnowBe4 common
stock, and may be obtained by requesting it in writing from KnowBe4 at the address described in the section titled “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.”
The Preliminary Presentation Materials were for discussion purposes only and did not present any findings or make any recommendations or constitute
an opinion of Morgan Stanley with respect to the fairness of the Merger Consideration or otherwise. The financial analyses performed by Morgan
Stanley in relation to its opinion dated October 11, 2022, as described above under “—Summary of Financial Analyses,” superseded all analyses and
information presented in the Preliminary Presentation Materials.

General
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a
whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various
analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s
view of the actual value of KnowBe4. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond KnowBe4’s control. These include,
among other things, the impact of competition on KnowBe4’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse
material change in the financial condition and prospects of KnowBe4 and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in
Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Price
to be received by the holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Stockholders) in the
Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of October 11, 2022 to the Special Committee.
These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of KnowBe4 common stock might actually trade.
The Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Rollover
Stockholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Special Committee and Vista
and was recommended by the Special Committee and approved by the KnowBe4 Board. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Special Committee during
these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to KnowBe4 or the Special Committee, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that
any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of
the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are
available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how KnowBe4’s stockholders
should vote at the Special Meeting.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Special Committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Special Committee to
recommend that the KnowBe4 Board approve, and the KnowBe4 Board to approve, the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a
committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.

Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Special Committee with financial advisory services and an opinion, described in
this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the Merger, and KnowBe4 has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley an
aggregate fee of approximately $51 million, approximately $10 million of which was earned following delivery of the opinion described in this section and
attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. KnowBe4 has also agreed
to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional
advisors, actually incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, KnowBe4 has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and
their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain
losses, claims, damages or liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement.
In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing services for KnowBe4 and
received aggregate fees of approximately $5 to $10 million in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s
opinion, Morgan Stanley provided financial advisory and financing services to the Vista Related Entities and received aggregate fees of approximately
$120 to $140 million in connection with such services (this includes fees attributable to a transaction that closed on September 30, 2022 and financial
advisory and financing services fees from companies that were no longer majority-controlled affiliates or portfolio companies of Vista at the time the
relationships disclosure memorandum was circulated by Morgan Stanley on July 12, 2022). In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion,
Morgan Stanley provided financial advisory and financing services to the KKR Related Entities and received aggregate fees of approximately $80 to $105
million in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley has not provided financial
advisory and financing services to Elephant Partners. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and/or financing services to KnowBe4,
Parent, Vista, the Vista Related Entities, KKR, the KKR Related Entities and Elephant Partners in the future and would expect to receive fees for the
rendering of these services.
Position of the Purchaser Filing Parties as to the Fairness of the Merger
Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, each Purchaser Filing Party may be deemed to be an affiliate of KnowBe4 and, therefore,
required to express its belief as to the fairness of the proposed Merger to KnowBe4’s “unaffiliated security holders,” as defined under Rule 13e-3 of the
Exchange Act. The Merger is a Rule 13e-3 transaction for which a Schedule 13e-3 Transaction Statement has been filed with the SEC. The Purchaser Filing
Parties are making the statements included in this section solely for purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules and
regulations under the Exchange Act. However, the view of the Purchaser Filing Parties as to the fairness of the Merger should not be construed as a
recommendation to any KnowBe4 stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the Merger Proposal. The Purchaser Filing Parties have
interests in the Merger that are different from, and in addition to, the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4.
The Purchaser Filing Parties did not participate in the deliberation of the Special Committee regarding, nor receive advice from the respective legal or
other advisors of the Special Committee as to, the fairness of the Merger. The Purchaser Filing Parties have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor
to perform, any valuation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4.
Based on, among other things, the factors considered by, and the analysis and resulting
 
65
Table of Contents
conclusions of, the KnowBe4 Board and the Special Committee discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Special Factors—Reasons for
the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board” (which analysis and resulting conclusions the Purchaser Filing Parties
adopt), the Purchaser Filings Parties believe that the Merger is substantively fair to the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4. In particular, the
Purchaser Filing Parties considered the following:
 
•
the current and historical market prices of the KnowBe4 common stock, including the market performance of KnowBe4 Class A common
stock relative to those of other participants in KnowBe4’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Per Share Price
represents a premium of approximately 44 percent to the unaffected closing price of KnowBe4’s Class A common stock on September 16,
2022, the last full trading day before the filing of the Schedule 13D/A by Vista Filing Parties which disclosed Vista’s initial non-binding
acquisition proposal;
 
•
the fact that the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, KnowBe4 and KnowBe4’s stockholders
(including the Unaffiliated Stockholders and, accordingly, KnowBe4’s unaffiliated security holders, as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act);
 
•
the fact that the Per Share Price shall be paid in all cash, thus allowing the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 to immediately realize a
certain and fair value for their shares, which value represents a significant premium to the closing price of the KnowBe4 common stock on
the last full trading day before the filing of the Schedule 13D/A by Vista Filing Parties which disclosed Vista’s initial non-binding acquisition
proposal;
 
•
the fact that the Merger will provide liquidity for the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 without the delays that would otherwise be
necessary in order to liquidate the positions of larger holders, and without incurring brokerage and other costs typically associated with
market sales;
 
•
the fact that the Merger is not conditioned on any financing being obtained by Parent, increasing the likelihood that the Merger will be
consummated and that the consideration to be paid to the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 in the Merger will be received; and
 
•
the potential risks to KnowBe4 of continuing to have publicly traded common stock, including the risks of market volatility and global
economic uncertainty.
 
•
The Purchaser Filing Parties further believe that the Merger is procedurally fair to the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 based upon,
among other things, the following factors:
 
•
the fact that the KnowBe4 Board was fully informed about the extent to which the interests of the Purchaser Filing Parties in the Merger
differed from those of the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4;
 
•
the fact that the KnowBe4 Board formed the Special Committee consisting solely of non-management independent members of the
KnowBe4 Board not affiliated with the Purchaser Filing Parties at the outset of discussions of a potential transaction between KnowBe4 on
the one hand and Vista on the other;
 
•
the fact that since the outset of discussion of the potential transaction, Vista has, to the extent that such transaction involved a rollover by
Stu Sjouwerman, the Elephant Funds and/or the KKR Investors, conditioned the potential transaction upon the approval of the Special
Committee and the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the voting power held by the
outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a single class) held by the Unaffiliated Stockholders and entitled to vote
on the Merger Agreement;
 
•
the fact that the Special Committee retained, and had the benefit of advice from, nationally recognized legal and financial advisors;
 
66
Table of Contents
•
the fact that the Merger consideration was the result of the Special Committee’s extensive arm’s-length negotiations with Parent;
 
•
the fact that the Special Committee had the authority to reject any proposals made by Parent or any other person;
 
•
notwithstanding the fact that the Morgan Stanley opinion was not delivered to the Purchaser Filing Parties and the Purchaser Filing Parties
are not entitled to rely on such opinion, the fact that the KnowBe4 Board received a written opinion from Morgan Stanley on October 11,
2022, stating that as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in preparing its opinion, the Per Share Price was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of KnowBe4 common stock;
 
•
the fact that the closing of the Merger is conditioned on KnowBe4’s receipt of the requisite KnowBe4 stockholder approvals, including the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of
KnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a single class) held by the Unaffiliated Stockholders and entitled to vote on the Merger
Agreement;
 
•
KnowBe4’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to provide information to, or participate in discussions
or negotiations with, third parties regarding acquisition proposals that constitute, or are reasonably likely to lead to, superior proposals;
 
•
KnowBe4’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement related to a superior proposal, subject to paying Parent a termination fee of $138 million in cash, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; and
 
•
the availability of appraisal rights to KnowBe4’s stockholders who comply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law for
exercising appraisal rights, which allow such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares.
The Purchaser Filing Parties also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the substantive and procedural fairness of the
proposed Merger, including:
 
•
(1) the fact that the unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4 will not participate in any future earnings, appreciation in value or growth of
KnowBe4’s business and will not benefit from any potential sale of KnowBe4 or its assets to a third party in the future, (2) the risk that the
Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all, and (3) the fact that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed corporations with
essentially no assets other than (a) the funding commitments of the VEPF Funds and KKR Investor, (b) the rollover commitments of the
Purchaser Filing Parties, and (c) the funding commitments of the debt financing sources;
 
•
the restrictions on the conduct of KnowBe4’s business prior to the completion of the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement, which may
delay or prevent KnowBe4 from undertaking business opportunities that may arise and certain other actions it might otherwise take with
respect to the operations of KnowBe4 pending completion of the Merger;
 
•
the negative effect that the pendency of the Merger, or a failure to complete the Merger, could potentially have on KnowBe4’s business and
relationships with its employees, vendors and customers;
 
•
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, KnowBe4 and its subsidiaries are restricted from soliciting, proposing,
initiating or knowingly encouraging the submission of acquisition proposals from third parties or the making of any inquiry, proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;
 
•
the possibility that the amounts that may be payable by KnowBe4 upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, including payment to
Parent of a termination fee of $138 million in cash, and the processes
 
67
Table of Contents
required to terminate the Merger Agreement, including the opportunity for Parent to make revisions to its Merger Proposal, could
required to terminate the Merger Agreement, including the opportunity for Parent to make revisions to its Merger Proposal, could
discourage other potential acquirors from making a competing bid to acquire KnowBe4; and
 
•
the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to KnowBe4’s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Purchaser Filing Parties in connection with the fairness of
the Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material factors considered by them. The Purchaser Filing Parties did not find it
practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their conclusion as to the fairness of the
Merger. Rather, the Purchaser Filing Parties reached their position as to the fairness of the Merger after considering all of the foregoing as a whole. The
Purchaser Filing Parties believe these factors provide a reasonable basis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the
unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4. This position should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any KnowBe4 stockholder to
approve the Merger Agreement. The Purchaser Filing Parties make no recommendation as to how stockholders of KnowBe4 should vote their shares
relating to the Merger. The Purchaser Filing Parties attempted to negotiate the terms of a transaction that would be most favorable to them, and not to the
unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4, and, accordingly, did not negotiate the Merger Agreement with a goal of obtaining terms that were fair to the
unaffiliated security holders of KnowBe4.
Based on the Purchaser Filing Parties’ knowledge and analysis of available information regarding KnowBe4, the Special Committee and the KnowBe4
Board, as well as discussions with members of KnowBe4’s senior management regarding KnowBe4 and its business and the factors considered by, and
findings of, the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board and discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Special Factors—Reasons for
the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board; Fairness of the Merger,” the Purchaser Filing Parties believe that the
Merger is fair to the unaffiliated security holders.

Following completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will have been merged with and into KnowBe4, with KnowBe4 surviving the Merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. The shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock are currently listed on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act.
Following completion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock and, as promptly as practicable
following the effective time of the Merger and in compliance with applicable law, the KnowBe4 Class A common stock securities will be delisted from the
Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act.
At the effective time of the Merger, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will become the initial directors of the
surviving corporation, and the officers of KnowBe4 immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will become the officers of the surviving
corporation, in each case until their successor is duly elected and qualified or until the earlier of his or her death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. At the effective time of the Merger, KnowBe4’s certificate of incorporation
and bylaws will be amended and restated to be in the form of (except with respect to the name of the entity) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Merger Sub and, as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of KnowBe4 following the Merger until thereafter amended in
accordance with their respective terms and Delaware law.
The Purchaser Filing Parties currently anticipate that KnowBe4’s operations initially will be conducted following completion of the Merger substantially
as they are currently being conducted (except that KnowBe4 will cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent).
The Purchaser Filing Parties are currently conducting a review of KnowBe4 and its business and operations with a view towards determining how
 
68Table of Contents
to redirect KnowBe4’s operations to improve KnowBe4’s long-term earnings potential as a private company (including by reducing KnowBe4’s costs and
expenses following the Merger) and expect to complete such review following completion of the Merger. Further, following completion of the Merger, the
Purchaser Filing Parties will continue to assess KnowBe4’s assets, corporate and capital structure, capitalization, operations, business, properties and
personnel to determine what additional changes, if any, would be desirable following the Merger to enhance the business and operations of KnowBe4. In
addition, Parent may seek to buy or combine KnowBe4 with target companies that provide earnings and growth synergies; however, no definitive
contracts, arrangements, plans, proposals, commitments or understanding currently exist. Although presently there are no definitive contracts,
arrangements, plans, proposals, commitments or understandings regarding any such transactions, the Purchaser Filing Parties and certain of their
affiliates may seek, from and after the effective time of the Merger, to acquire target companies or assets that operate in KnowBe4’s industry.
Certain Effects of the Merger
If the requisite approvals of KnowBe4’s stockholders are obtained and all other conditions to closing of the Merger are satisfied or waived, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the Merger, (1) Merger Sub will
merge with and into KnowBe4; (2) the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease; and (3) KnowBe4 will continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, KnowBe4 will cease to be a publicly traded company, KnowBe4 Class A
common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act and KnowBe4 will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If
the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.
The effective time of the Merger will occur upon the filing of a Certificate of Merger with, and acceptance of that certificate by, the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (or at a later time as KnowBe4, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in such Certificate of Merger).
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger:
 
•
the Excluded Shares will be canceled and cease to exist without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor;
 
•
each certificate formerly representing any shares of KnowBe4 common stock or any book-entry shares that represented shares of KnowBe4
common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will automatically be canceled and extinguished and will automatically
convert into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Price, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding
taxes;
 
•
the Rollover Shares will be contributed to Parent pursuant to the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements;
 
•
each KnowBe4 RSU Award and KnowBe4 PSU Award, to the extent then vested but not yet settled, or which vests upon the consummation
of the Merger, will automatically be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
of (1) the Per Share Price and (2) the total number of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock then subject to the then-vested portion of
such award (less any required withholding and other taxes) (these KnowBe4 RSU Awards and KnowBe4 PSU Awards include those held by
certain of KnowBe4’s directors (whose KnowBe4 RSU Awards are subject to “single trigger” vesting acceleration), as more fully described
in the section captioned “Special Factors—Interests of KnowBe4’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”);
 
•
each KnowBe4 RSU Award, to the extent not then vested, will automatically be canceled and converted into a contingent right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Price and (2) the total number of shares of KnowBe4 Class A
common stock subject to the then-unvested portion of such award (less any required withholding and other taxes), which
 
69
Table of Contents
amount will vest and be payable pursuant to the unvested KnowBe4 RSU Award’s vesting schedule, subject to the same terms and
conditions (including continued employment conditions) as the corresponding KnowBe4 RSU Award;
 
•
each KnowBe4 PSU Award, to the extent not then vested, will be deemed to have had the applicable performance-based vesting conditions
achieved at 100 percent of target, and will automatically be canceled and converted into a contingent right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Price and (2) the total number of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock
subject to the then-unvested portion of such award (less any required withholding and other taxes), and such cash amount will vest
pursuant to the corresponding unvested KnowBe4 PSU Award’s time-based vesting schedule, subject to the same terms and conditions
(including continued employment conditions, but excluding performance vesting conditions) as the corresponding KnowBe4 PSU Award;
 
•
each outstanding KnowBe4 Option Award, to the extent then vested, will automatically be canceled and converted into a right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price less the exercise price per share of such
KnowBe4 Option Award, and (2) the number of shares of KnowBe4 Class B common stock then issuable upon exercise in full of such
vested KnowBe4 Option Award (less any required withholding and other taxes); and
 
•
each outstanding KnowBe4 Option Award, to the extent not then vested, will automatically be canceled and converted into a contingent
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price less the exercise
price per share of such KnowBe4 Option Award, and (2) the number of shares of KnowBe4 common stock then issuable upon exercise in full
of the unvested portion of such KnowBe4 Option Award (less any required withholding and other taxes), which amount will vest and be
payable pursuant to the unvested KnowBe4 Option Award’s vesting schedule, subject to the same terms and conditions (including
continued employment conditions) as the corresponding KnowBe4 Option Award.
At the effective time of the Merger, KnowBe4’s Amended and Restated 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and 2021 Equity Incentive Plan will be terminated, and
no further awards will be granted under such plans.
At or prior to the closing of the date of the Merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated paying agent to pay the aggregate Per
Share Price. Once a stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its stock certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of a stock certificate)
or customary agent’s message with respect to book-entry shares, appropriate letter of transmittal and other items specified by the payment agent, then
the payment agent will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of the aggregate Per Share Price. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
Following the Merger, all of the equity interests in the surviving corporation will be owned by Parent. If the Merger is completed, Parent (and the Rollover
Stockholders indirectly through their equity interests in Parent) will be the sole beneficiaries of KnowBe4’s future earnings and growth, if any, and will be
entitled to vote on corporate matters affecting KnowBe4 following the Merger. Similarly, Parent (and the Rollover Stockholders indirectly) will also bear
the risks of ongoing operations, including the risks of any decrease in KnowBe4’s value after the merger.
In connection with the Merger, certain members of KnowBe4’s management will receive benefits and be subject to obligations that are different from, or in
addition to, the benefits and obligations of KnowBe4’s stockholders generally, as described in more detail under “—Interests of KnowBe4’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger.” Those incremental benefits are expected to include, among other benefits, certain executive officers continuing as
executive officers of the surviving corporation.

Table of Contents
Benefits of the Merger for the Unaffiliated Security Holders
The primary benefit of the Merger to the “unaffiliated security holders,” as defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act, will be their right to receive the Per
Share Price for each share of KnowBe4 common stock held by such stockholders as described above. This amount constitutes a premium of
approximately 44 percent to the unaffected closing price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock of $17.30 per share on September 16, 2022, the last full
trading day before Vista publicly disclosed its initial non-binding acquisition proposal. Additionally, such stockholders will avoid the risk after the
Merger of any possible decrease in KnowBe4’s future earnings, growth or value.
Detriments of the Merger to the Unaffiliated Security Holders
The primary detriment of the Merger to the “unaffiliated security holders,” as defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act, is the lack of an interest of such
stockholders in the potential future earnings, growth, or value realized by KnowBe4 after the Merger. In addition, the unaffiliated security holders will not
benefit from any sale of KnowBe4 or its assets to a third party in the future. Additionally, the receipt of cash in exchange for KnowBe4 common stock
pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable sale transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders who surrender their KnowBe4
common stock in the Merger to the extent that such stockholders have any gain on their shares of KnowBe4 common stock.
Certain Effects of the Merger for the Purchaser Filing Parties
If the Merger is completed, all of the equity interests in KnowBe4 will be beneficially owned, indirectly through Parent, by the Purchaser Filing Parties and
their affiliates.
The benefits of the Merger to the Purchaser Filing Parties include the fact that, following the completion of the Merger, Parent will directly own 100
percent of the outstanding equity interests of the surviving company and will therefore have a corresponding 100 percent interest in the surviving
company’s net book value and net earnings. The table below sets forth the beneficial ownership of KnowBe4 common stock and resulting interests in
KnowBe4’s net book value and net earnings of the Purchaser Filing Parties prior to and immediately after the Merger, based on KnowBe4’s net book
value at September 30, 2022 and net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as if the Merger were completed on such date.

In addition, the Purchaser Filing Parties will benefit from the savings associated with KnowBe4 no longer being required to file reports under or otherwise
having to comply with provisions of the Exchange Act. Detriments of the Merger to the Purchaser Filing Parties include the lack of liquidity for KnowBe4
common stock following the Merger and the risk that KnowBe4 will decrease in value following the Merger.
Certain Effects on KnowBe4 if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the requisite votes of KnowBe4’s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
KnowBe4’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of KnowBe4 common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, (1) KnowBe4
will remain an independent public company; (2) KnowBe4 common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the
Exchange Act; and (3) KnowBe4 will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, KnowBe4 expects that: (x)
our management will continue to operate the business as it is currently being operated; and (y) KnowBe4’s stockholders will continue to be subject to the
same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which KnowBe4 operates
and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the Merger not to be completed, the price of KnowBe4
common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of KnowBe4 Class A common stock would return to
the price at which the KnowBe4 Class A common stock trades as of the date of this proxy statement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the
effect of the Merger not being completed on the future value of your shares of KnowBe4 common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the KnowBe4
Board will continue to evaluate and review, among other things, KnowBe4’s business, operations, strategic direction and capitalization, and will make
whatever changes it deems appropriate. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the requisite votes of KnowBe4’s stockholders or if the Merger is not
completed for any other reason, KnowBe4’s business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely impacted.
In addition, in specified circumstances in which the Merger Agreement is terminated, KnowBe4 has agreed (1) to pay Parent a termination fee of $138
million or (2) to reimburse Parent for its reasonable and documented third party transaction expenses up to $15 million, depending on the circumstances of
the termination, as more fully described in “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination
Fees and Remedies.”",82,86

Other than in connection with our regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, we do not, as a matter of course, make public projections
as to our long-term future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying
assumptions and estimates. However, KnowBe4 management regularly prepares projections as to our future financial performance for internal use.
In connection with our strategic planning process and evaluation of strategic alternatives (including continuing as an independent company), KnowBe4
management prepared and reviewed with the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board the Management Plan (which included unaudited forward-
looking financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2025) as part of KnowBe4 management’s business plan, including the Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information set forth below. At the direction of the Special Committee, cash flows for 2026 through 2032 were extrapolated by Morgan Stanley
and approved by the KnowBe4 management for use by Morgan Stanley in connection with its financial analyses for the purpose of rendering an opinion
to the Special Committee. This forward-looking information is collectively referred to as the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, as described in
more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.” 
 
72Table of Contents
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided to the Special
Committee and the KnowBe4 Board for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the Merger and strategic alternatives thereto. At the
direction of the Special Committee and the KnowBe4 Board, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was also provided to, and approved for use
by, Morgan Stanley for purposes of performing its financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the Special Committee (as more fully
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC”). With KnowBe4’s consent, Morgan Stanley
assumed that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently available estimates and
judgments as to KnowBe4’s future financial performance. In addition, a subset of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was provided to Vista
prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed by KnowBe4 management as then-current estimates of our future financial performance
as an independent company, without giving effect to the Merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the Merger Agreement or the
Merger, the expenses that have already and will be incurred in connection with completing the Merger, or any changes to KnowBe4’s operations or
strategy that may be implemented in connection with the pendency of, or following the consummation of, the Merger. The Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the Merger to be completed; it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in
that context.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with GAAP. In addition, the
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information included in this document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, KnowBe4’s management. Neither KPMG
LLP nor any other independent accountants have audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information and, accordingly, they do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The
KPMG LLP report incorporated by reference relates solely to KnowBe4’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information and should not be read to do so.
Although the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates as to
future events, including those detailed above, made by KnowBe4 management that KnowBe4 management believed in good faith were reasonable.
KnowBe4’s ability to achieve the financial results contemplated by the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be affected by our ability to
achieve our strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods, and will be subject to operational and execution risks associated
therewith. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important
factors that may affect actual results and cause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information not to be achieved include, among others, (1) general
economic conditions; (2) our ability to achieve operating objectives with respect to expenses and operating margins, as well the risks to our ability to
grow revenues resulting from the execution of those objectives; (3) our ability to achieve the various monetization, market share and other assumptions
underlying the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information; (4) changes in laws, regulations and taxes relevant to KnowBe4’s business; (5) competitive
pressures in the cybersecurity industry, including new products and market entrants and changes in the competitive environment; (6) customer demand
for our products and services; (7) our ability to attract, integrate and retain qualified personnel; and (8) uncertainty in the timing of relevant transactions
and resulting cash inflows and outflows. Additional factors that may impact us or our business can be found in the various risk factors included in our
periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained
in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information may differ from publicized analyst estimates and
forecasts. You should evaluate the Unaudited Prospective Financial
 
73
Table of Contents
Information, if at all, in conjunction with our historical financial statements and other information regarding KnowBe4 contained in our public filings with
the SEC. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information may not be consistent with KnowBe4’s historical operating data as a result of the assumptions
detailed above. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future
events.
Because the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as well as
to multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also covers multiple
years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not,
and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not fact and
should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results or for purposes of making any investment decision.
Certain of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information are non-GAAP financial measures, which are financial
performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for
GAAP financial measures and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are
limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.
Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business
combination transaction, such as the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, are excluded from the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures”
under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not subject to SEC rules regarding
disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial
measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Special Committee, the KnowBe4 Board, Morgan
Stanley or Vista. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is provided in this
proxy statement.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. By including the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
in this proxy statement, none of KnowBe4, Morgan Stanley or any of our or Morgan Stanley’s representatives has made or makes any representation to
any person regarding our ultimate performance as compared to the information contained in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The
inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information should not be regarded as an indication that the Special Committee, the KnowBe4 Board,
KnowBe4, Morgan Stanley or any other recipient of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information considered, or now considers, the Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information to be predictive of KnowBe4’s performance or actual future results. For information on factors that may cause our
future results to materially vary, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.” Further, the inclusion of the Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by KnowBe4 that the information presented
is material. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is included in this proxy statement solely to give our stockholders access to the information
that was made available to the Special Committee, the KnowBe4 Board, Morgan Stanley and Vista. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is
not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any KnowBe4 stockholder as to how to vote at the special meeting with respect to the Merger,
or whether to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares.

Table of Contents
In preparing the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, KnowBe4 management utilized the following material assumptions:
 
•
Revenue growth rates ranging from 31 percent to 26 percent were applied to years 2023 through 2025 and reflect KnowBe4’s expectations of
future growth in consideration of historical experience. These growth rates assume renewals of existing customer contracts consistent with
KnowBe4’s historical logo retention which is in the high 90 percent range. Additionally, the growth rates reflect expectations of growth
within international markets and additional cross selling of KnowBe4’s existing and future products.
 
•
EBITDA growth is consistent with the expectation of realizing future efficiencies as the business continues to scale and ranges from an
EBITDA margin of 15 percent in 2022 up to 31 percent in 2025. This growth is reflective of (1) KnowBe4’s expectations of efficiencies across
the sales organization as management automates certain aspects of the sales process; (2) reductions in general and administrative costs as
the historical investments in KnowBe4’s support functions are realized at scale; and (3) future realization of KnowBe4’s current market
evangelism and product marketing efforts.
 
•
Capital expenditures are higher in 2022 and 2023 to support management’s current international expansion plans. A normalized level of
spend is reflected for 2024 and 2025.
 
•
Stock-based compensation expense ranges from 8 percent to 9 percent of revenues for years 2022 through 2024 and reflects a consistent
application of management’s existing equity incentive plan.
 
•
Unlevered free cash flow is anticipated to improve from 12 percent in 2022 to 19 percent in 2025, with the exception of a reduction in 2023
primarily driven by anticipated expenses related to international expansion. These increases are the result of revenue growth in excess of 25
percent for each of these years combined with reductions in our overall cost structure.
 
•
No material acquisitions or divestitures by KnowBe4 are anticipated.

KnowBe4 PSU Award, to the extent vested but not yet settled as of the effective time of the Merger (or which vests upon the consummation
of the Merger), will automatically be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
of (1) the Per Share Price and (2) the total number of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock then subject to the then-vested portion of
such award. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the

receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Price and (2) the total number of shares of KnowBe4
Class A common stock subject to the then-unvested portion of such award. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)
will vest and be paid out pursuant to the corresponding KnowBe4 PSU Award’s time-based vesting schedule, subject to the same terms and
conditions (including continued employment conditions but excluding performance vesting conditions) as applied to the KnowBe4 PSU
Award immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.

will automatically be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Price less the exercise price per share of such KnowBe4 Option Award, and (2) the number of shares of
KnowBe4 Class B common stock then issuable upon exercise in full of such vested KnowBe4 Option Award. This amount (less any required
withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the Merger.

of shares of KnowBe4 common stock then issuable upon exercise in full of the unvested portion of such KnowBe4 Option Award. This
amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will vest and be paid out pursuant to the corresponding KnowBe4 Option Award’s
time-based vesting schedule, subject to the same terms and conditions (including continued employment) as applied to the KnowBe4
Option Award immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.
Treatment of the ESPP
The KnowBe4 Board has adopted resolutions that (1) provide that no new participants will commence participation in the ESPP after the date of the
Merger Agreement, (2) provide that no payroll contributions or separate non-payroll contributions may be made on or following the date of the Merger
Agreement, (3) provide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence or be extended pursuant to the ESPP, in each case, after the date of
the Merger Agreement, (4) cause any offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be outstanding at the effective time of the
Merger to be terminated no later than the date of the closing of the Merger, but prior to the effective time of the Merger, (5) make any adjustments that
may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase
period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP, and (6) cause the exercise (as of no
later than the closing date of the Merger, but prior to the effective time of the Merger) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; that on
such exercise date, KnowBe4 will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s account to the purchase of
whole shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP; and that immediately prior to and effective as of the effective
time of the Merger (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), KnowBe4 will terminate the ESPP.
Accordingly, from and after the date of the Merger Agreement, no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP, and no
further contributions will be made to the ESPP by payroll deductions or other methods. No later than November 21, 2022, KnowBe4 will apply any funds
within each ESPP participant’s (including KnowBe4’s executive officers’) account to the purchase of whole shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP. These shares will be deposited into the applicable participant’s account and will treated in the same manner as any
other outstanding share of KnowBe4 Class A common stock in connection with the consummation of the Merger. Any amounts not used for the
purchase of shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock will be refunded.

Represents shares of KnowBe4 common stock held as of December 7, 2022 (without regard to any change in control-related accelerated vesting). The values shown with
respect to the shares held directly are determined as the product of the Per Share Price multiplied by the total number of shares of KnowBe4 common stock held by such
individual. The number of shares shown does not include shares of KnowBe4 common stock that the executive officer may purchase after the date of the Merger
Agreement under the ESPP. For additional information regarding the treatment of our ESPP in the Merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—
Treatment of the ESPP.” For additional information regarding beneficial ownership of KnowBe4 common stock, see the section of this proxy statement captioned

Represents shares of KnowBe4 common stock subject to KnowBe4 RSU Awards and KnowBe4 PSU Awards outstanding as of December 7, 2022 (without regard to any

Per Share Price multiplied by the total number of shares of KnowBe4 common stock subject to KnowBe4 RSU Awards or KnowBe4 PSU Awards, as applicable. The
number of shares of KnowBe4 common stock subject to KnowBe4 PSU Awards is based on achievement at 100 percent of target. Accordingly, the number of shares
represents unvested KnowBe4 PSU Awards covering a total of 165,572 shares of KnowBe4 common stock for Mr. Sjouwerman; 44,188 shares of KnowBe4 common
stock for Mr. Reich; 66,229 shares of KnowBe4 common stock for Mr. Letonoff; and 34,375 shares of KnowBe4 common stock for Mr. Venkataraman. As described
further in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Non-Employee Director Equity Awards”, KnowBe4 RSU Awards outstanding as of the date of the closing of
the Merger (which date, solely for purposes of this proxy statement, is assumed to be December 7, 2022) that are held by our non-employee directors will accelerate
vesting in full upon the effectiveness of the Merger. In addition, each of the KnowBe4 executive officers is eligible for vesting acceleration of his or her KnowBe4 RSU
Awards and KnowBe4 PSU Awards in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment under their respective employment agreements, as described further
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Employment Agreements with Current Executive Officers”. For additional information regarding the KnowBe4 RSU
Awards and KnowBe4 PSU Awards for our named executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Mr. Venkataraman served as KnowBe4’s Co-President and Chief Financial Officer until March 2022, at which time he was appointed to the KnowBe4 Board. In
accordance with the terms of the separation agreement and general release entered into between KnowBe4 and Mr. Venkataraman on March 10, 2022, his KnowBe4 RSU
Awards granted prior to his resignation will continue vesting subject to his continued service, including as a member of the KnowBe4 Board. All of Mr. Venkataraman’s
KnowBe4 RSU Awards are currently subject only to time-based vesting, and all of the shares subject to the KnowBe4 Option Awards held by Mr. Venkataraman were fully
vested and exercisable as of December 7, 2022.
Change in Control and Severance Benefits under Existing Agreements
Non-Employee Director Equity Awards
KnowBe4 has granted certain KnowBe4 Option Awards under its 2016 Equity Incentive Plan that are outstanding and held by our non-employee
directors. Such awards are subject to letter agreement amendments, which provide for accelerated vesting upon a “change of control.” The closing of the
Merger will be a “change of control” within the meaning of such amendments.
Additionally, KnowBe4 has granted certain KnowBe4 RSU Awards under its 2021 Equity Incentive Plan that are outstanding and held by our non-
employee directors. Such awards are subject to our Outside Director Compensation Policy, which provide for accelerated vesting upon a “change in
control.” The closing of the Merger will be a “change in control” within the meaning of our Outside Director Compensation Policy.
In February 2022, KnowBe4 granted a KnowBe4 RSU Award under its 2021 Equity Incentive Plan that is outstanding and held by Mr. Venkataraman. Such
award was granted in connection with Mr. Venkataraman’s transition to a non-employee director and is subject to the same accelerated vesting upon a
“change in control” as awards granted under our Outside Director Compensation Policy.
Employment Agreements with Current Executive Officers
In February 2020, KnowBe4 entered into agreements with each of Mr. Sjouwerman and Mr. Letonoff (collectively, the “EO Agreements”), which provide
that if Mr. Sjouwerman or Mr. Letonoff, as applicable, is terminated by KnowBe4 without “cause” or by him for “good reason,” (an “involuntary
termination”) he will be entitled to following severance benefits, payable in cash, less applicable withholdings, in the form of equal payroll installment
payments:
 
•
12 months of base salary (as in effect at the time of termination of employment);
 
•
any earned but unpaid annual bonus;
 
•
a prorated portion of the target bonus amount; and
 
•
the aggregate payments made by KnowBe4 towards the executive’s medical and dental benefits during the 365-day period immediately prior
to his termination of employment.
The severance benefits are conditioned on Mr. Sjouwerman or Mr. Letonoff, as applicable, executing and not revoking a general release of claims in favor
of KnowBe4 and the executive’s continued compliance with certain
 
80
Table of Contents
restrictive covenants, including perpetual confidentiality and non-disparagement covenants as well as non-compete and non-solicit obligations
applicable for a period of 24 months following the date of his respective termination of employment. If any of the payments or benefits provided for under
an agreement with Mr. Sjouwerman or Mr. Letonoff, as applicable, or otherwise payable to him would constitute “excess parachute payments” within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and could be subject to the related excise tax, he will receive either full payment of such payments and benefits or
such lesser amount that would result in no portion of the payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the greater amount
of after-tax benefits to him. KnowBe4 is not required to provide any tax gross-up payments to Mr. Sjouwerman or Mr. Letonoff.
Equity Award Agreements with Current and Former Executive Officers
KnowBe4 has granted certain KnowBe4 RSU Awards under our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan that are outstanding and held by KnowBe4’s current and
former executive officers. Such awards provide that, if (1) KnowBe4 incurs a “change in control” and (2) during the period on and in the 12 months
following the change in control, (a) the executive officer’s employment is terminated by KnowBe4 (or its successor) without “cause” or (b) the executive
officer resigns from employment with KnowBe4 (or its successor) for “good reason”, then, in each case, 100 percent of the KnowBe4 RSU Award will
accelerate and vest, subject to the executive officer executing a release of claims in favor of KnowBe4 (or its successor). The KnowBe4 RSU Awards
granted to Mr. Venkataraman in connection with his employment include this provision.
Additionally, we have granted certain KnowBe4 PSU Awards under our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan that are outstanding and held by our executive
officers. Such awards provide that if a “change in control” occurs during the “performance period,” then 100 percent of the KnowBe4 PSU Awards will
become “eligible RSUs” assuming achievement at the target level and will be subject to time-based vesting only. Such eligible RSUs would be subject to
the same “double-trigger” acceleration described above with respect to KnowBe4 RSU Awards.
Retention Bonuses
On December 2, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the KnowBe4 Board awarded Lars Letonoff, KnowBe4’s Co-President and Chief Revenue Officer,
and Robert Reich, KnowBe4’s Chief Financial Officer, cash retention bonuses, each in the amount of $1,375,000 (the “Retention Bonuses”). 50 percent of
each Retention Bonus will vest and become payable upon the closing of the Merger, and 50 percent of each Retention Bonus will vest and become
payable 90 days following the closing of the Merger, subject to certain conditions, including, but not limited to, their respective continued employment
through each such date. Additionally, the Retention Bonuses will not vest unless (1) the Merger closes in either calendar year 2022 or 2023 and (2) Mr.
Reich and Mr. Letonoff, respectively, continue to comply with their confidentiality obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if KnowBe4 terminates the
employment of Mr. Reich or Mr. Letonoff without cause, then the unvested portion of his Retention Bonus will fully vest and be payable within 60 days
following such termination of employment, subject to his execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of KnowBe4.
Golden Parachute Compensation
The information set forth in the tables below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about
certain compensation for each of KnowBe4’s named executive officers (“NEOs”) that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and assumes, among
other things, that the Merger is consummated and that the NEOs will incur a severance-qualifying termination of employment immediately following
consummation of the Merger. The NEOs for KnowBe4’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 included Stu Sjouwerman, Krish Venkataraman and Lars
Letonoff. Mr. Venkataraman served as KnowBe4’s Co-President and Chief Financial Officer until March 2022, at which time he ceased to be an executive
officer and became a member of the KnowBe4 Board.

Table of Contents
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date,
including assumptions described below, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the consummation of the merger. If
payments to an NEO under his respective agreement(s) (as described above in “—Change in Control and Severance Benefits under Existing
Agreements”) would be subject to excise taxes under Section 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such payments will be reduced if and to the
extent such reduction would result in a better result to the NEO taking into account applicable taxes. For purposes of calculating such amounts, KnowBe4
has assumed:
 
•
December 7, 2022, which is the latest practicable date prior to this filing, as the date of the closing of the Merger;
 
•
each NEO experiences an involuntary termination on December 7, 2022, based on the terms of his respective agreement(s) (as described
above in “—Change in Control and Severance Benefits under Existing Agreements”); and
 
•
a value per share equal to the Per Share Price.

(b) in the case of Mr. Letonoff, the value of his Retention Bonus payable in connection with the Merger, as described above in “—Retention Bonuses.” As discussed
above, under the EO Agreements, upon an involuntary termination, Mr. Sjouwerman or Mr. Letonoff, as applicable, will be entitled to (1) 12 months of base salary (as in
effect at the time of termination of employment), (2) any earned but unpaid annual bonus, (3) a prorated portion of the target bonus amount, and (4) the aggregate
payments made by us towards the executive’s medical and dental benefits during the 365-day period immediately prior to his termination of employment, in each case,
less applicable withholdings, in the form of equal payroll installment payments. All components of the cash severance amount are contingent upon an involuntary
termination and are subject to the NEO’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims KnowBe4’ standard separation agreement and release of claims.

As described above in “—Retention Bonuses,” Mr. Letonoff is eligible to receive 50 percent of his Retention Bonus upon the closing of the Merger, and if Mr. Letonoff is terminated without cause
immediately following the Merger, he will have a right to receive the remaining 50 percent of his Retention Bonus within 60 days of such termination, subject to his execution and non-revocation of a
general release of claims in favor of KnowBe4.

As noted above, each NEO is eligible for a (1) any earned but unpaid annual bonus and (2) a prorated portion of the target bonus amount. Assuming that the NEO experiences an involuntary termination
on December 7, 2022, we do not expect that there will be any earned but unpaid annual bonus. The amount listed represents the NEO’s target annual bonus opportunity, prorated to reflect a termination
on December 7, 2022.
 
(2)
As noted above, each of Mr. Sjouwerman and Mr. Letonoff is eligible for 100 percent acceleration of his KnowBe4 RSU Awards and KnowBe4 PSU Awards in the event he
experiences an involuntary termination within 12 months of a change in control. As also noted above, if a change in control occurs during the performance period, then
100 percent of the shares subject to a KnowBe4 PSU Award will become eligible to vest and be subject to the acceleration rights described in the preceding sentence. We
expect that the Merger will close following the end of the performance period applicable to the currently-outstanding KnowBe4 PSU Awards, but as noted above for the
purposes here we have assumed that the Merger was consummated on December 7, 2022, prior to the end of the performance period. As a result, we have assumed here
that KnowBe4 PSU Awards will become eligible to vest at target levels. Set forth below are the values of each unvested KnowBe4 RSU Award and KnowBe4 PSU Award
held by the NEOs that would become vested upon an involuntary termination immediately following the consummation of a change-in-control.

Employment Arrangements Following the Merger
As of the date of this proxy statement, other than the Retention Bonuses described above, none of KnowBe4’s executive officers have (1) reached an
understanding on potential employment or other retention terms with the surviving corporation or with Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their respective
affiliates); or (2) entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding employment or other retention with the surviving corporation or with
Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their respective affiliates) to be effective following the consummation of the Merger. However, prior to the effective time
of the Merger, Parent or Merger Sub (or their respective affiliates) may have discussions with certain of KnowBe4’s employees (including certain of its
executive officers) regarding employment or other retention terms and may enter into definitive agreements regarding employment, retention, or the right
to purchase or participate in the equity of the surviving corporation or one or more of its affiliates in connection with the Merger. Any such agreements
will not increase or decrease the Per Share Price paid to KnowBe4’s stockholders in the Merger.

KnowBe4’s directors and executive officers have informed KnowBe4 that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the KnowBe4
common stock owned directly by them in favor of the Merger Proposal and each of the other proposals listed in this proxy statement. As of the Record
Date, KnowBe4’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, approximately 47 percent of the voting
power of the shares of KnowBe4 common stock outstanding as of the Record Date.
For purposes of clarity, the shares of KnowBe4 common stock that the directors and executive officers are entitled to vote shall be included in
determining whether the Merger Agreement has been approved by the affirmative vote of (1) the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a single class) entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement, (2) the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 Class A common stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, and (3) the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 Class B common stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, but the shares held by KnowBe4’s
officers will be excluded from determining whether the Merger Agreement has been approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock (voting together as a single class), held by the Unaffiliated Stockholders and entitled
to vote on the Merger Agreement.

On December 8, 2022, Kevin Mitnick, as trustee of the Mitnick Trust, who beneficially owned approximately 9 percent of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock as of the Record Date, entered into the Mitnick Support Agreement, pursuant to which he agreed, by and
on behalf of the Mitnick Trust, to vote all of the Mitnick Shares in favor of the Merger Proposal, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the
Mitnick Support Agreement. The Mitnick Support Agreement does not provide for the “roll over” of the Mitnick Shares or the purchase of equity in
Parent, nor does it impose any transfer restrictions on the Mitnick Shares.
 
83Table of Contents
In addition, in connection with entering to the Merger Agreement, on October 11, 2022, Parent, KnowBe4 and the Rollover Stockholders entered into the
Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements, pursuant to which the Rollover Stockholders agreed to vote all of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock in
favor of the transaction, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the Rollover Stockholder Support Agreements. In addition, the Founder and
the Elephant Funds agreed to “roll over” a portion of their existing equity in KnowBe4 into an ownership interest in the parent company of Parent.
Pursuant to its Rollover Stockholder Support Agreement, the KKR Investor has the ability to “roll over” a portion of its existing equity in KnowBe4 into
an ownership interest in the parent company of Parent. If the KKR Investor “rolls over” a portion of its equity, then the amount of the KKR Investor’s
equity contribution to Parent pursuant to the KKR Equity Commitment Letter will be reduced dollar-for-dollar. As of the Record Date, the Rollover
Stockholder Support Agreements cover approximately 71 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock. However,
approval of the Merger Proposal also requires the Unaffiliated Stockholder Vote, which excludes all of the shares of KnowBe4 common stock (1) held by
the Rollover Stockholders and certain of their affiliates and (2) KnowBe4’s officers, but does not exclude the Mitnick Shares.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-
U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of KnowBe4 common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the
merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code,
court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy
statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who
hold their shares of KnowBe4 common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment
purposes).
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular
circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
 
•
tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as
financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations,
 
84Table of Contents
partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of
accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion
rules; holders who hold their common stock as “qualified small business stock” for purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code; or
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 
•
tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction
transaction;
 
•
tax consequences to holders who received their shares of KnowBe4 common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the
exercise of options or warrants or whose common stock is subject to employment-based vesting;
 
•
tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 
•
tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located,
organized or resident outside the United States;
 
•
tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
 
•
tax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the shares of
KnowBe4 common stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in the Code);
 
•
the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
 
•
any territory, state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
 
•
tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of
the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial
owner of shares of KnowBe4 common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of KnowBe4 common stock and partners therein should consult their tax
advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger described below. If the IRS contests
a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A
HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO
THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX
LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY TERRITORY, STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of KnowBe4 common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 
85
Table of Contents
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 
•
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons
as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a
United States person.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of KnowBe4 common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount
that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s
holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to
long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder
acquired different blocks of shares of KnowBe4 common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis
and holding period separately with respect to each block of KnowBe4 common stock.
Non-U.S. Holders 
General
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of KnowBe4 common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder
nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Subject to the discussion below relating to FATCA (as defined below), any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such
gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax
treaty);
 
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the completion of the
Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30
percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or
 
•
KnowBe4 is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code
(“USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with
respect to the applicable shares of KnowBe4 common stock (the “relevant period”) and, if shares of KnowBe4 common stock are regularly
traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly,
indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of KnowBe4 common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such
gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above),
except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real property
interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests
plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real property interests generally include land,
improvements and associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, KnowBe4 believes that it is not, and
has not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their
own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if it is a USRPHC.

Table of Contents
Withholding on Foreign Entities
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder (“FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal
withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution
enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial
information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as
certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding
tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a certification identifying
certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an
applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of
such taxes. The Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal
withholding tax of 30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of KnowBe4 common stock. In its preamble to such proposed
regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Holders of KnowBe4 common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the
disposition of KnowBe4 common stock pursuant to the Merger.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger.
Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder
is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of
such Non-U.S. Holder’s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form); or (b) otherwise establishes an
exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be
allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",98,101

General Efforts
Under the Merger Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and KnowBe4 agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, do, or
cause to be done, all things and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, or causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable law to consummate the Merger, including: (1) obtaining all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations from governmental
authorities; and (2) making all registrations, declarations and filings with governmental authorities, in each case that are necessary or advisable to
consummate the Merger.
HSR Act; Competition Laws
Under the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until Parent and KnowBe4 file a Notification and Report Form with the Federal Trade Commission
(the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. The
parties filed a notification and report form with the FTC and DOJ on October 26, 2022. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed
until the expiration of a 30-calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination
of that waiting period. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on November 25, 2022.

KnowBe4 and Parent have each agreed to (1) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause the other to be supplied) with any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in
which any such filing is made; and (2) use its respective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to, as soon as practicable, (a) cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws applicable to the Merger and (b) obtain
any required consents pursuant to any antitrust laws applicable to the Merger.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ
could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and
contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, any state could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of KnowBe4 or Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the
antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to, if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the Merger
pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws applicable to the Merger, (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, (a) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of KnowBe4 and its subsidiaries; and (b) any other restrictions on the activities of
KnowBe4 and its subsidiaries; unless such action would have a material adverse effect on the business of KnowBe4 and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.
Limited Guarantees
Pursuant to the Limited Guarantees, which were entered into by the Guarantors in favor of KnowBe4 on October 11, 2022, each Guarantor agreed to
guarantee a pro rata share of the due, punctual and complete payment of the termination fee if and when payable by Parent to KnowBe4 pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement and certain other liabilities and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement plus amounts in

pursuant to the Merger Agreement;

Financing of the Merger
The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the payment of consideration due to our stockholders and the holders of our equity-
based awards and options under the Merger Agreement, the repayment of all obligations under our existing credit agreement and the payment of all
related fees and expenses, will be funded with the proceeds of committed equity and debt financing, together with cash on hand at KnowBe4. The equity
and debt financing commitments will be funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter, as
further described below.
Equity Commitment
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, each of (1) the Guarantors committed to provide
Parent on, at or prior to the closing date of the Merger with an equity contribution of up to approximately $2.18 billion and (2) the KKR Investor
committed to provide Parent on, at or prior to the closing date of the Merger with an equity contribution of up to approximately $300 million (which
commitment may be assigned to affiliates of the KKR Investor, and which amount may be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the value of any Rollover Shares
contributed by the KKR Investor pursuant to its Rollover Stockholder Support Agreement).
Debt Commitment
Pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, the financial institutions party thereto (the “debt financing sources”) have severally and not jointly committed
(1) to provide to Parent (or one or more of its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries) on the closing date of the Merger a senior secured term facility
in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1 billion; and (2) to make available to Parent and its restricted subsidiaries (a portion of which may be
made available on the closing date of the Merger) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $125 million,
in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.
The obligation of the debt financing sources to provide the credit facilities described above is subject to customary conditions, including the following:
 
•
the prior consummation or substantially simultaneous consummation of the Merger in all material respects in accordance with the Merger
Agreement, without any amendments, consents or waivers that would be materially adverse to the interests of the debt financing sources in
their capacity as such without the approval thereof (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
 
•
the occurrence or substantially concurrent funding of the equity contribution;
 
•
the execution and delivery of definitive loan, guarantee and security documentation for the credit facilities and the delivery of customary
closing documents;

(giving effect to the materiality qualifiers contained in the Merger Agreement) that are material to the interests of the debt financing sources
but only to the extent that Parent or its affiliates have the right (taking into account any applicable cure provisions) to terminate their
obligations under the Merger Agreement or not to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as a result of a
breach of such representations;
 
•
the prior consummation or substantially simultaneous consummation of the repayment of all obligations under KnowBe4’s existing credit

Litigation Relating to the Merger
On November 15, 2022, a purported KnowBe4 stockholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against
KnowBe4 and the members of the KnowBe4 Board, captioned O’Dell v. KnowBe4, Inc., et al., Case No. 22-cv-9727 (the “Complaint”).
The Complaint asserts claims against all defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder for issuing allegedly
false and misleading statements in KnowBe4’s preliminary proxy
 
90Table of Contents
statement and against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged “control person” liability with respect to such
allegedly false or misleading statements. The allegations in the Complaint include that the preliminary proxy statement omitted material information
regarding KnowBe4’s financial projections, the analyses performed by Morgan Stanley, potential conflicts of interest involving Morgan Stanley, and
potential conflicts of interest involving alleged KnowBe4 insiders. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, (1) to enjoin defendants from consummating
the Merger; (2) to rescind the Merger Agreement or recover damages, if the Merger is completed; (3) an accounting of damages; and (4) attorneys’ fees
and costs.
The defendants believe that the disclosures set forth in the preliminary proxy statement comply fully with all applicable law and that the allegations
contained in the Complaint are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of the Merger may be filed in the future. No assurances can be made as to
the outcome of such lawsuits or the Complaint.

This proxy statement, the documents to which KnowBe4 refers you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or other written
statements made or to be made by KnowBe4 or on KnowBe4’s behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to
historical facts, including, without limitation, statements relating to the completion of the Merger. You can typically identify forward-looking statements
by the use of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,”
“potential,” “plan,” “forecast,” “intend,” “target,” “possible” and other words of similar import, or the negative versions of such words. KnowBe4’s
stockholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve significant risks and
uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not
limited to, the risks detailed in KnowBe4’s filings with the SEC, including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described
or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and the following factors:
 
•
the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure of KnowBe4’s stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement pursuant to the requisite
stockholder votes or the failure to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the Merger;
 
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right to terminate the Merger, and the risk that the
Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require KnowBe4 to pay a termination fee;
 
•
the nature, cost and outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against KnowBe4 and others related to the Merger
Agreement;
 
•
risks that the pendency of the Merger affects KnowBe4’s current operations or KnowBe4’s ability to retain or recruit employees;
 
•
economic, market, business or geopolitical conditions (including resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, or the conflict in Ukraine
and related sanctions against Russia and Belarus) or competition, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting KnowBe4’s business,
operations and financial performance;
 
•
the fact that receipt of the all-cash Per Share Price will be taxable to KnowBe4’s stockholders that are treated as U.S. Holders for U.S. federal
income tax purposes;
 
•
the fact that, if the Merger is completed, KnowBe4’s stockholders (other than the Purchaser Filing Parties) will forgo the opportunity to
realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of KnowBe4’s current strategy as an independent company;
 
•
the possibility that KnowBe4 could, following the Merger, engage in operational or other changes that could result in meaningful
appreciation in its value;
 
•
the possibility that KnowBe4 could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special dividends or
the sale of some or all of KnowBe4’s assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, that could conceivably produce a higher aggregate
value than that available to its stockholders in the Merger;
 
•
the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, KnowBe4 is restrained from soliciting other acquisition proposals during the
pendency of the Merger;
 
•
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on KnowBe4’s business relationships, customers, operating results and
business generally, including risks related to the diversion of the attention of KnowBe4 management or employees during the pendency of
the Merger;
 
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;
 
92Table of Contents
•
the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the Merger may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability;
 
•
the risk that the proposed Merger will not be consummated in a timely manner, creating potential uncertainty around the transaction and
exceeding the expected costs of the Merger;
 
•
the risk that KnowBe4’s stock price may fluctuate during the pendency of the Merger and may decline significantly if the Merger is not
completed; and
 
•
risks related to obtaining the requisite stockholder approvals for the Merger.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that KnowBe4 makes in this proxy statement are qualified by the information contained or
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, including: (1) the information contained under this caption; and (2) information in KnowBe4’s most
recent filings on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, including the information contained under the caption “Risk Factors,” and information in its consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from
the forward-looking statements.
Except as required by applicable law, KnowBe4 undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. KnowBe4’s stockholders are advised to consult any future disclosures that KnowBe4 makes on related subjects
as may be detailed in its other filings made from time to time with the SEC.

A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the
bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote your shares. For example, if you provide
instructions to your bank, broker or nominee with respect to the Merger Proposal but do not provide instructions with respect to the Compensation
Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, then a “broker non-vote” will occur with respect to each of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment

If you are a stockholder of record (that is, your shares are registered in your name with KnowBe4’s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.),
you may vote your shares by returning a signed and dated proxy card (a proxy card and a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience), or
you may vote at the Special Meeting using the control number located on the enclosed proxy card. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically
over the internet or by telephone by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the
instructions on the proxy card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or internet and
telephone proxy, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your direction.
If you attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote at the Special Meeting, you will need the control number located on the enclosed proxy card.
Beneficial owners of shares held in “street name” must also provide a “legal proxy” from their bank or broker in order to vote at the Special Meeting. You
are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote at the Special Meeting, your
vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.
All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies (or proxies granted electronically over the internet or by telephone) will, if received before
the Special Meeting, be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies (or proxies
granted electronically over the internet or by telephone) that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (2) “FOR”
the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. You may also attend the Special Meeting and vote
at the Special Meeting if you have a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Special
Meeting. If available from your bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote over the internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee
by following the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not (1) return your bank’s,
broker’s or other nominee’s voting instruction form; (2) vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee; or (3) attend
the Special Meeting and vote at the Special Meeting with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you
voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. It will not, however, have any effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, except to the
extent affecting the obtaining of a quorum at the meeting.

•
attending the Special Meeting and voting at the Special Meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If you have submitted a proxy, your attendance at the Special Meeting, in the absence of voting at the Special Meeting or submitting an additional proxy

If you hold your shares of KnowBe4 common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should contact your bank, broker or
other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your

regulations, the members of the KnowBe4 Board are “participants” with respect to the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Special Meeting.
The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by KnowBe4. KnowBe4 has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a professional proxy solicitation firm, to
assist in the solicitation of proxies, and provide related advice and informational support during the solicitation process, for a fee of up to $60,000, plus
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. KnowBe4 will indemnify this firm against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on its behalf. In
addition, KnowBe4 may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares of KnowBe4 common stock for their
expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by KnowBe4’s directors, officers and employees,
personally or by telephone, email, fax or over the internet. No additional compensation will be paid for such services.

do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger
under Section 262 of the DGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL
for perfecting and exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail the section of this proxy statement captioned “Appraisal Rights,” which
description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, a copy of which may be

Holders of record and beneficial owners of KnowBe4 common stock who are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery
may receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the Merger through the date of
payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the
entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to persons seeking appraisal, interest will accrue
thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such
voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, persons who wish to seek appraisal of their
shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Persons considering seeking appraisal should
be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of
the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Appraisal Rights—Determination of Fair Value.”
To exercise appraisal rights, a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner of KnowBe4 common stock must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of
such holder’s shares or such owner’s shares of KnowBe4 common stock to KnowBe4 before the vote is taken on the Merger Proposal; (2) not vote, in
person or by proxy, in favor of the Merger Proposal (whether by voting against the Merger Proposal, abstaining or otherwise not voting with respect to
the Merger Proposal); (3) continuously hold (in the case of holders of record) or continuously own (in the case of beneficial owners) the subject shares
of KnowBe4 common stock through the effective date of the Merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights
under the DGCL. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of KnowBe4 common stock and you wish to exercise appraisal rights in such capacity, in addition
to the foregoing requirements, your demand for appraisal must also (1) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares of KnowBe4 common stock
for which the demand is made, (2) be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such
documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and (3) provide an address at which you consent to receive notices given by
the surviving corporation hereunder and to be set forth on the verified list required by Section 262(f) of DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the
procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting and

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and
elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached
to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. KnowBe4 encourages you to carefully read and consider
the Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the
information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the
Merger Agreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. 
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of
the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; (3) may be subject to
important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by KnowBe4, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the
terms of the Merger Agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports
and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by KnowBe4 in
connection with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the
purpose of allocating contractual risk between KnowBe4, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, rather than to establish
matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the
representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger
Agreement may have the right not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a
change in circumstance or otherwise. KnowBe4’s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not
rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or
condition of KnowBe4, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of
the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the
closing of the Merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the Merger Agreement after the effective time of the Merger. In addition, you
should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of KnowBe4, Parent and Merger Sub
because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as
otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger agreement is described
below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other
factual information regarding KnowBe4, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants
and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document
and in KnowBe4’s filings with the SEC regarding KnowBe4 and its business.

Prior to the closing of the Merger, Parent will select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to KnowBe4 (the “payment agent”) to make payments
of the Merger consideration to KnowBe4 stockholders. At or prior to the closing of the Merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
payment agent cash that is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate Per Share Price to KnowBe4 stockholders in accordance with the Merger
Agreement.
Promptly (and in any event within three business days) following the effective time of the Merger, Parent and the surviving corporation will cause the
payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger represented outstanding shares of KnowBe4 common stock (other than Excluded Shares) whose shares of KnowBe4
common stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable under the Merger Agreement, a letter of transmittal and instructions
advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for the Merger consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates for
cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together with any required bond); and (2) a duly completed and signed
letter of transmittal, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares
of KnowBe4 common stock represented by such certificate and (b) the Per Share Price. The amount of any consideration paid to such KnowBe4
stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of KnowBe4 common stock held in book-entry form (“uncertificated shares”) will not be required to
deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal (as both are described above) to the payment agent to receive the Merger consideration payable in
respect thereof. Each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) of uncertificated shares that immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger represented an outstanding share of KnowBe4 common stock (other than the Excluded Shares) will, upon receipt of an
“agent’s message” in customary form at the effective time of the Merger, or any documents as may reasonably be requested by the payment agent, be
entitled to receive, and the payment agent will pay and deliver as promptly as practicable, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate
number of shares of KnowBe4 common stock represented by such holder’s transferred uncertificated shares; and (2) the Per Share Price. The amount of
consideration paid to such KnowBe4 stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the Merger, such cash will be returned to
Parent upon demand, and any KnowBe4 stockholders as of immediately prior to the Merger who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the
Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of payment of the Merger consideration (subject to abandoned property law,
escheat law or similar laws). None of the payment agent, Parent, the surviving corporation or any other party will be liable to any KnowBe4 stockholder

expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, financial condition or results of operations of KnowBe4 and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; or (2) would render KnowBe4 unable to consummate the Merger prior to the termination date of the Merger Agreement, but, with respect to clause
(1) none of the following, and no Effects arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the following (in each case, by themselves or when aggregated) will
be deemed to be or constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or will be taken into account when determining whether a Company Material Adverse

have a disproportionate adverse effect on KnowBe4 and its subsidiaries relative to comparable companies operating in the industry in

acquisition proposal after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from a breach in any material respect of the Merger Agreement. KnowBe4
and the KnowBe4 Board (or a committee thereof, including the Special Committee) may only take the actions contemplated by the preceding sentence if
the KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, or the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (1) such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to lead
to a superior proposal; and (2) the failure to take the actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.
From the date of the Merger Agreement to the effective time of the Merger (or termination of the Merger Agreement), KnowBe4 has agreed that it will
promptly (and, in any event, by the earlier of (1) 24 hours from the receipt thereof or (2) 5:00 p.m. on the next business day) notify Parent in writing if an

proposal. Such notice must include (1) the identity of the person or group making such proposal (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the
terms of any confidentiality agreement with such person or group that is in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement); and (2) a summary of the
material terms and conditions of such proposal and, if in writing, a copy thereof. Thereafter, KnowBe4 must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt
basis (and in any event within 24 hours), of the status and terms of, any developments regarding, any such acquisition proposal (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including by providing copies of all written materials sent to or from
KnowBe4 or any of its representatives relating to such acquisition proposal.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:
 
•
“superior proposal” means any bona fide written acquisition proposal on terms that the KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation
of the Special Committee, or the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) would be more favorable to KnowBe4 stockholders (in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the Merger
(taking into account (1) any revisions to the Merger Agreement and the transaction documents made or proposed in writing by Parent prior
to the time of such determination; (2) the availability of financing (to the extent applicable), likelihood of consummation in accordance with
the terms of such acquisition proposal and regulatory considerations; and (3) those other factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith
by the KnowBe4 Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, or the Special Committee, which factors may include the
(a) identity of the person making the proposal; and (b) legal, financial, timing and other aspects of such acquisition proposal. For purposes
of the reference to an “acquisition proposal” in this definition, all references to “15 percent” in the definition of “acquisition transaction”

From and after the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will honor all of KnowBe4’s arrangements providing for compensation or
employee benefits (“KnowBe4 benefit plans”) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, except that
the surviving corporation is permitted to amend or terminate such KnowBe4 benefit plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by
applicable law.
As of the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation or one of its subsidiaries will continue to employ all of KnowBe4’s employees and all of
the employees of KnowBe4’s subsidiaries immediately following the effective time of the Merger by taking such actions, if any, as are required by
applicable law. After the effective time of the Merger and until December 31, 2023, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (1) provide each
employee employed by KnowBe4 or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger who continues to be so employed as of
immediately following the effective time of the Merger (each, a “continuing employee”) with employee benefits (other than the opportunity to participate
in employee stock purchase plans, equity or equity-based benefits, retention, change in control, nonqualified deferred compensation, incentive, bonus or
transaction benefits, defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation or post-employment welfare benefit plans or arrangements (“excluded
arrangements”)) of the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect on the date of
the Merger Agreement under the KnowBe4 benefit plans; and (2) provide annual base salary, base wages and short-term cash incentive opportunities to
each continuing employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary, base wages and short-term cash incentive
opportunities provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time. In each case, base salary, base wages and short-term target
cash incentive compensation opportunities (other than the excluded arrangements) will not be decreased following the effective time of the Merger until
December 31, 2023, for any continuing employee employed during that period. After the effective time of the Merger and until December 31, 2023, the
surviving corporation will provide to continuing employees who are terminated without cause severance benefits that are no less favorable than those
provided by KnowBe4 and its subsidiaries as of the date of the Merger Agreement under the KnowBe4 benefit plans.
Continuing employees generally will be granted service credit for all service with KnowBe4 and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the Merger
and with Parent, the surviving corporation and any of their subsidiaries

on or after the effective time of the Merger, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting (other than vesting of future equity awards), for purposes of
future vacation accrual under KnowBe4’s current plan and for purposes of determining severance pay entitlement, except that such service need not be
credited if it would result in duplication of benefits. Parent and the surviving corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) permit continuing
employees to participate immediately in any and all new compensation or benefit arrangements that replace KnowBe4 benefit plans to the same extent as
they were eligible under the replaced KnowBe4 benefit plans; (2) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions, limitations or similar requirements to
be waived for a continuing employee and his or her covered dependents (to the same extent such conditions, limitations or requirements were met or
otherwise not applicable to such continuing employee under the replaced KnowBe4 benefit plans as of the effective time of the Merger) and any eligible
expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents under a KnowBe4 benefit plan to be given full credit with respect to
any new benefit arrangement that replaces the applicable KnowBe4 benefit plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance,
offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements for the applicable plan year; and (3) credit continuing employees for any unused balances in flexible
spending accounts if participation under a new benefit plan flexible spending account plan occurs mid-year. Continuing employees will also receive credit

to agree to the payment of a consent fee, “profit sharing” payment or other consideration (including increased or accelerated payments), or the provision

clauses (1) or (2), if such action would have a material adverse effect on the business of KnowBe4 and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Financing
Under the Merger Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or
cause to be done) all things necessary, proper and advisable to obtain the equity financing and the debt financing on the terms and conditions described

•
using its reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with
their respective terms and subject to the conditions thereof;
 
•
complying with its obligations under each of the Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter and each fee letter relating to the
debt financing;
 
•
satisfying on a timely basis the conditions to funding the equity financing and the debt financing in each of the Equity Commitment Letters,

using its reasonable best efforts to consummate the equity financing and the debt financing at or prior to the closing;
 
•
complying with its obligations pursuant to each of the Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter and each fee letter relating
to the debt financing;
 
•
negotiating, executing and delivering definitive agreements with respect to the equity financing and the debt financing that reflect the terms
and conditions contained in the Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter; and
 
•
enforcing its rights pursuant to each of the Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter and each fee letter relating to the debt

than as a result of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other provision of the Merger Agreement by KnowBe4) to fund the required
amount, then Parent has agreed, to the extent permitted by the Debt Commitment Letter, to use its reasonable best efforts to replace the unavailable
portion of the debt financing with alternative financing arrangements; so long as:
 
•
such alternative financing arrangements provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the equity financing and other
sources of readily available liquidity of Parent, Merger Sub, KnowBe4 and KnowBe4’s subsidiaries on the closing date of the Merger, to
fund the required amount;
 
•
such alternative financing arrangements are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate to Parent (as determined by Parent in good faith)
than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee letters (the “alternate debt financing”); and
 
•
Parent obtains one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such alternate debt financing (the “new debt commitment
letters”), which new debt commitment letters will replace the existing debt commitment letter in whole or in part.
Parent has agreed to promptly provide a copy of any new debt commitment letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith, which may be delivered
with the fee amounts and “flex” terms redacted in a customary manner so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount,
conditionality, availability or termination of the alternate debt financing) to KnowBe4.
KnowBe4 is entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to
cause the equity financing to be funded (or, in the case of the KKR Investor, satisfied with Rollover Shares pursuant to its Rollover Stockholder Support
Agreement) after all applicable conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied.
Under the Merger Agreement, KnowBe4 agreed, upon request by Parent, to use, and to cause its subsidiaries and their respective representatives to use,
their reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation as may be customary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the debt financing,
subject to certain conditions.
Obtaining the equity and debt financing is not a condition to the closing.

its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements entered into prior to the effective time of the Merger between KnowBe4 and any of its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of

Merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the certificates
of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the subsidiaries of KnowBe4, as applicable, as
of the date of the Merger Agreement. During such six-year period or such period in which an indemnified person is asserting a claim for indemnification
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, whichever is longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as
required by applicable Law.
Furthermore, during the period commencing at the effective time of the Merger and ending on the sixth anniversary of the effective time of the Merger, the
surviving corporation has agreed to (and Parent has agreed to
 
117Table of Contents

agreement with KnowBe4 or any of its subsidiaries in effect as of the effective time of the Merger, each indemnified person (in their capacity as such)
from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
to the extent that such legal proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (1) any action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, in such indemnified person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of KnowBe4 or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates
(regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the effective time of the Merger); and (2) the
Merger, as well as any actions taken by KnowBe4, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger (including any disposition of assets of the surviving
corporation or any of its subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries insolvent).
During the period commencing at the effective time of the Merger and ending on the sixth anniversary of the effective time of the Merger, the surviving
corporation has agreed to (and Parent has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to) maintain in effect KnowBe4’s current directors’ and officers’
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the Merger on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of such insurance. Prior to the effective time of the Merger, and in lieu of
maintaining such insurance pursuant to the foregoing sentence, KnowBe4 may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the directors’ and officers’
liability insurance. The surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to) maintain the tail policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as the tail policy is in full force and effect.

stock and 36,256,823 shares of KnowBe4 Class B common stock, representing, in the aggregate, approximately 71 percent of the outstanding voting

capital stock owned by it in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and various related matters as well as in favor

If the Merger is consummated, holders of record and beneficial owners of KnowBe4 common stock who do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal
(whether by voting against the Merger Proposal, abstaining or otherwise not voting with respect to the Merger Proposal), who properly demand an
appraisal of their shares, who continuously hold (in the case of holders of record) or continuously own (in the case of beneficial owners) their shares of
KnowBe4 common stock through the effective date of the Merger, who otherwise comply with the statutory requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and
who do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal, subject to the conditions thereof, are entitled to seek appraisal of their
shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”). Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262
and in this summary to a “stockholder” or to a “holder of shares” are to a record holder of KnowBe4 common stock. Unless the context requires
otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “beneficial owner” are to person who is the beneficial owner of shares of KnowBe4
common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262
and in this summary to a “person” are to any individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following summary does not
constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that KnowBe4’s stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section
262. Holders of record and beneficial owners of shares of KnowBe4 common stock should carefully review the full text of Section 262 as well as the
information discussed below.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of record or beneficial owners of shares of KnowBe4 common stock who (1) submit a written
demand for appraisal of such holder’s or owner’s shares of KnowBe4 common stock to KnowBe4 prior to the vote on the Merger Proposal; (2) do not
vote in favor of the Merger Proposal (whether by voting against the Merger Proposal, abstaining or otherwise not voting with respect to the Merger
Proposal); (3) continuously hold (in the case of a holder of record) or own (in the case of a beneficial owner) such shares through the effective date of the
Merger; and (4) otherwise comply with the statutory requirements and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262, may be entitled to
have their shares of KnowBe4 common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash for the “fair value” of their
shares of KnowBe4 common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with (unless
the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court
of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of
KnowBe4 common stock and you wish to exercise appraisal rights in such capacity, in addition to the foregoing requirements, your demand must also (1)
reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which that demand is made, (2) be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial
ownership of such shares of KnowBe4 common stock and include a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it
purports to be, and (3) provide an address at which you consent to receive notices given by the surviving corporation and to be set forth on the verified
list required by Section 262(f). However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine persons
entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number
of shares of KnowBe4 common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of the class of KnowBe4 common stock eligible
for appraisal; or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million. KnowBe4 refers to these
conditions as the “ownership thresholds.” Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest
on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment at five
percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from
 
141Table of Contents
time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary
cash payment to each person seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid
and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The
surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where the proposed merger for which appraisal rights are provided is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of KnowBe4’s
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record date for notice of
such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or information directing KnowBe4’s stockholders to a
publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes KnowBe4’s
notice to KnowBe4’s stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 may be accessed
without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with
the Merger, any holder of record or beneficial owner of shares KnowBe4 common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to
preserve such holder’s or owner’s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a
timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder or beneficial owner who loses such holder’s or
owner’s appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price described in the Merger Agreement without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of KnowBe4 common stock, KnowBe4
believes that if a stockholder or a beneficial owner is considering exercising such rights, that stockholder or beneficial owner should seek the advice of
legal counsel.
Stockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock must do ALL of the
following:
 
•
the stockholder or beneficial owner must not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal;
 
•
the stockholder or beneficial owner must deliver to KnowBe4 a written demand for appraisal of such holder’s or owner’s shares of KnowBe4
common stock before the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting; and
 
•
the stockholder must continuously hold or the beneficial owner must continuously own the shares from the date of making the demand
through the effective date of the Merger (a stockholder or beneficial owner will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder or beneficial owner
transfers the shares before the effective date of the Merger).
Any person who has complied with the applicable requirements of Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights or the surviving corporation
may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such persons within 120 days after the
effective date of the Merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so).
In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine persons entitled to appraisal rights, will
dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.
For stockholders, because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, each
stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the Merger Proposal, abstain or not vote his, her or its
shares.

"KnowBe4, Inc._20221222_DEFM14A_20521596_4563944.Pdf",Written Demand,"Written Demand  
A stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to KnowBe4, before the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special
Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such holder’s or owner’s shares of KnowBe4 common stock. In addition, that stockholder or beneficial
owner must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal. A vote in favor of the Merger Proposal, in person at the Special Meeting or by
proxy (whether by mail or via the Internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any
previously filed written demands for appraisal with respect to such stockholder’s shares. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record
the shares of KnowBe4 common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the
effective date of the Merger. A beneficial owner exercising appraisal rights must own the shares of KnowBe4 common stock on the date the written
demand for appraisal is made and must continue to own such shares through the effective date of the Merger. For a stockholder, a proxy that is submitted
and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, and it will constitute a waiver of the
stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. A stockholder or beneficial owner who submits a
proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the Merger Proposal or abstain from voting
on the Merger Proposal. Neither voting against the Merger Proposal nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal will, in and of
itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal. A proxy or vote against the Merger Proposal will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s or
beneficial owner’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting will constitute a
waiver of appraisal rights.
A holder of record of shares of KnowBe4 common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand
for appraisal in respect of shares of KnowBe4 common stock by or on behalf of holder of record must reasonably inform KnowBe4 of the identity of the
holder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder’s shares.
A beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares of KnowBe4 common stock. A demand
for appraisal in respect of shares of KnowBe4 common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the beneficial owner and must reasonably inform
KnowBe4 of the identity of the beneficial owner and that the beneficial owner intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such owner’s shares. The
demand made by such beneficial owner must also (1) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares of KnowBe4 common stock for which the
demand is made, (2) be accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such
documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and (3) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive
notices given by the surviving corporation and to be set forth on the verified list required by Section 262(f).
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Attention: Corporate Secretary
At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding
or joined that proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the Per Share Price offered
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, by delivering to KnowBe4, as the surviving corporation, a
written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware
 
143Table of Contents
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any person who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
Merger consideration within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger. Except with respect to any person who withdraws such person’s demand in
accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal
proceeding with respect to a person, the person will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which
value could be less than, equal to or more than the Per Share Price being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 and
who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the value of the
shares held by all persons entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and
KnowBe4’s stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of
the shares of KnowBe4 common stock. Accordingly, any persons who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect
their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of KnowBe4 common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file
such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for an appraisal of such person’s shares
pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which KnowBe4 has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of
stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand pursuant to Section 262, the
holder of record of such shares will not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). The
surviving corporation must send this statement to the requesting person within 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request
for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a person and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be
obligated within 20 days after such service to file in the office of the Delaware Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given
to the surviving corporation and all of the persons shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. The forms of the notices by mail and by
publication will be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery and the costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.
 
144Table of Contents
After providing the foregoing notice, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the persons who have complied with
Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the persons who demanded
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon
of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any person fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the
proceedings as to such person.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of persons who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of the class of KnowBe4 common stock eligible for appraisal or (2)
the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.

After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the persons entitled to appraisal, and that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been
satisfied, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of KnowBe4
common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger
through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings,
to make a voluntary cash payment to each person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection
(h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in
such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest accrued before such
voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in
the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant
factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider
market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the
Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion
is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising
from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature
of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be
more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an
opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to,
and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although KnowBe4 believes that the Per Share Price is fair, no representation is made
as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the
 
145Table of Contents
Delaware Court of Chancery, and KnowBe4’s stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or
lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Price. Neither KnowBe4 nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Price to any stockholder or
beneficial owner exercising appraisal rights, and each of KnowBe4 and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to
subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of KnowBe4 common
stock is less than the Per Share Price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in
respect of persons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include
attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware
Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving
corporation pursuant to Section 262(f) who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section 262 or
subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of judgment under such subsection (a “Reservation”). In the absence of such determination or
assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of KnowBe4 common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly withdraws,
such person’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of KnowBe4 common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the
Merger into the right to receive the Per Share Price as provided in the Merger Agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such person’s
right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has
been satisfied in respect of persons seeking appraisal rights or if the person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person’s
demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Price as provided in the Merger Agreement in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the effective date of the Merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person’s shares in
compliance with Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of KnowBe4 common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the
Merger); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds
above has been satisfied in respect of the persons seeking appraisal rights or if such person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of
such person’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, then the right of such
person to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any
person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just, including, without limitation, a Reservation; provided, however, that the foregoing will not affect the right of any person who has
not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the Merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a person’s statutory appraisal rights. In that event,
you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the Merger Agreement, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any person wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to
exercise those rights.

KnowBe4 is asking you to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement. For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the
information about the Merger Agreement throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. You are urged to read the Merger
Agreement carefully and in its entirety.
The KnowBe4 Board, based on the recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that
KnowBe4 provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may become payable by
KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Special Factors—
Interests of KnowBe4’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation,” including the additional disclosures
referenced therein that otherwise are disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Special Factors—Interests of KnowBe4’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger.”
KnowBe4 is asking its stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by KnowBe4 to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Special Factors—Interests of KnowBe4’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes and additional disclosures
referenced therein. The various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made generally have previously formed
part of KnowBe4’s overall compensation program for its named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of its
annual proxy statement. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the KnowBe4 Board, which is
composed solely of non-employee directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, KnowBe4 is seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of KnowBe4 approve the compensation that will or may become payable to KnowBe4’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “Special Factors—Interests
of KnowBe4’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” in KnowBe4’s proxy statement for the Special
Meeting.”
KnowBe4’s stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as a non-binding, advisory vote, the result
will not be binding on KnowBe4, the KnowBe4 Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their
terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated KnowBe4’s named
executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions applicable to those payments.
The KnowBe4 Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

KnowBe4 is asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If stockholders approve this
proposal, KnowBe4 can adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies, including soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger
Agreement. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if KnowBe4 received proxies representing a sufficient
number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, KnowBe4 could
adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their
votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, KnowBe4 may seek stockholder approval to adjourn the Special Meeting if a
quorum is not present. Finally, the chairperson of the Special Meeting is permitted by KnowBe4’s bylaws to adjourn the Special Meeting even if
KnowBe4’s stockholders have not approved the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting.
The KnowBe4 Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

If the Merger is completed, KnowBe4 will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of KnowBe4’s
stockholders. However, if the Merger is not completed, KnowBe4’s stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder
meetings.
KnowBe4 will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2023 (the “2023 annual meeting”) only if the Merger has not already been completed and
KnowBe4 remains a public company.
For a stockholder who intends to have a proposal considered for inclusion in KnowBe4’s proxy materials for presentation at the 2023 annual meeting, if
held, KnowBe4’s Corporate Secretary must receive the written proposal at KnowBe4’s principal executive offices not later than December 7, 2022. In
addition, stockholder proposals must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-
sponsored proxy materials.
KnowBe4’s bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to specified matters to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders but
not included in KnowBe4’s proxy materials. To be timely for the 2023 annual meeting, KnowBe4’s Corporate Secretary must receive the required written
notice at its principal executive offices not earlier than 8:00 a.m. Eastern time on January 16, 2023, and not later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on February 15,

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
This agreement and plan of merger (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of October 11, 2022, by and among Oranje Holdco, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), Oranje Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”),
and KnowBe4, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are sometimes referred to as a “Party” and
collectively as the “Parties.” All capitalized terms that are used in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in Article I.
RECITALS
A. The Company Board has established a special committee of the Company Board, comprised solely of independent and disinterested directors
(the “Company Special Committee”), to, among other things, (i) review, evaluate and negotiate a strategic transaction with an existing stockholder of the
Company, including a strategic transaction with an existing stockholder of the Company that may include a transaction or series of transactions in which
one or more significant stockholders of the Company may have an interest that is in addition to, and/or different from, the interests of the Company’s
Stockholders as a whole, and (ii) make one or more recommendations, as appropriate, to the Company Board as to what action should be taken by the
Company Board, if any, with respect to such transactions.
B. The Company Special Committee has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Guarantees and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (all such transactions, collectively, the
“Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”), are advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Company Stockholders; (ii) recommended that the Company Board approve this Agreement, the Support
Agreements, the Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and determine that this Agreement, the Support
Agreements, the Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests
of the Company and the Unaffiliated Company Stockholders; and (iii) recommended that, subject to Company Board approval, the Company Board
submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for their adoption and approval and recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.
C. The Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, has (i) determined that this Agreement, the Support
Agreements, the Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, including the Unaffiliated Company Stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Support
Agreements, the Guarantees and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; (iii) approved the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Support Agreements and the Guarantees by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations in
this Agreement and the Support Agreements, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; (iv) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote of the Company Stockholders at a meeting of the Company
Stockholders; and (v) recommended that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger in
accordance with the DGCL.
D. Each of the board of managers of Parent and the board of directors of Merger Sub have (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance of their
respective covenants and other obligations under this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth
 
A-5
Table of Contents
in this Agreement; (iii) in the case of Merger Sub only, directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote of Parent in its capacity as
Merger Sub’s sole stockholder; and (iv) in the case of Merger Sub only, recommended that Parent vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the

accordance with Section 9.3.
(b) Hereof, Including, etc. When used in this Agreement, (i) the words “hereof,” “herein” and “herewith” and words of similar import will,
unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (ii) the phrase “the

Agreement will be paid in Dollars, and if any amounts, costs, fees or expenses incurred by any Party pursuant to this Agreement are denominated in a

currency to Dollars at the foreign exchange rates published by Bloomberg or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source reasonably determined
by the Company, in effect at the time that such amount, cost, fee or expense is incurred. If the resulting conversion yields a number that extends beyond
two decimal points, it will be rounded to the nearest penny.

voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and (B) properly demanded appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to, and in accordance with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Company Shares” until such time as
such holder fails to perfect, effectively waives or withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares
or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL) will not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7 but instead will be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except, however, if after the Effective Time, such Company Stockholder fails to perfect,
effectively withdraws or waives, or otherwise loses such holder’s right to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of
Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Per Share Price in accordance with this Agreement and will not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Company Shares.

demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.
2.8 Equity Awards.
(a) Company RSUs.
(i) Vested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit granted pursuant to a Company Equity Plan
that is subject to time-based vesting only (a “Company RSU”) and that is vested at the Effective Time (but not yet settled) or that vests as a result of the
consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a “Vested Company RSU”) will, automatically and without any required action on the
part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (x) the total number of shares
of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Vested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Per Share Price,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (the “Vested Company RSU Consideration”).
(ii) Unvested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company RSU granted pursuant to a Company Equity Plan
that is not a Vested Company RSU (an “Unvested Company RSU”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into the contingent right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an aggregate amount in cash (without interest)
(each, a “Converted Cash Award”) equal to (x) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Per Share Price, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8, each such Converted Cash Award assumed and converted pursuant to this Section 2.8 will continue to
have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including vesting conditions) as applied to the corresponding Unvested Company
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(b) Company PSUs. 
(i) Vested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit granted pursuant to a Company Equity Plan
that is subject to outstanding performance-based vesting (a “Company PSU”) and that is vested (but not yet settled) at the Effective Time (a “Vested
Company PSU”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (x) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Vested Company PSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement) multiplied by (y) the Per Share
Price, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (the “Vested Company PSU Consideration”).
(ii) Unvested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company PSU granted pursuant to a Company Equity Plan
that is not a Vested Company PSU (an “Unvested Company PSU”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into a Converted Cash Award with respect to an aggregate amount in cash (without interest) equal to (x) the total number of
shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (with, for the avoidance of
doubt, the performance metrics deemed achieved at 100%

of target) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Price, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Except as otherwise provided
in this Section 2.8, each such Converted Cash Award assumed and converted pursuant to this Section 2.8 will be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including time-based vesting conditions, but excluding performance-based vesting conditions) set forth in the applicable award agreement as
applied to the corresponding Unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Company Options.
(i) Vested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is vested at the Effective Time (a “Vested Company
Option”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash, equal to (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Vested Company Option multiplied
by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such Vested Company Option, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (the “Vested Company Option Consideration”).
(ii) Unvested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option granted pursuant to a Company Equity
Plan that is not a Vested Company Option (an “Unvested Company Option”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (x) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y)
the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such Unvested Company Option, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8, each such Converted Cash
Award assumed and converted pursuant to this Section 2.8 will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting
conditions) as applied to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(iii) Out-of-the-Money-Options. Any Company Option that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater
than or equal to the Per Share Price will be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.
(d) Payment Procedures. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than the first regularly
scheduled payroll date following the Closing Date, the applicable former holders of Vested Company Options, Vested Company RSUs, and Vested
Company PSUs will receive a payment from the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider (or, in the case of any Vested
Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU that is a Company Non-Employee Equity-Based Award, through the Company’s
standard accounts payable procedures), of the Vested Company Option Consideration, Vested Company RSU Consideration and Vested Company PSU
Consideration required to be paid to such former holders pursuant to this Section 2.8.
(e) Necessary Further Actions. The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will take all action reasonably necessary to
effect the cancellation of Company Equity-Based Awards and Company Options as of the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including
the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). All Company Equity-Based Awards and Company Equity
Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger).
(f) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company will take all
action that the Company determines to be reasonably necessary to (i) provide that no new participants will commence participation in the ESPP after the
date of this Agreement; (ii) provide that no payroll contributions or separate non-payroll contributions may be made on or following the date of this
Agreement; (iii) provide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence or be

extended pursuant to the ESPP, in each case, after the date of this Agreement; (iv) cause any offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that
otherwise would be outstanding at the Effective Time to be terminated no later than the Closing Date, but prior to the Effective Time; (v) make any
adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering
period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; and (vi) cause the
exercise (as of no later than the Closing Date, but prior to the Effective Time) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP. On such exercise
date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares
of Company Class A Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to
the consummation of the Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP.
2.9 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i)
obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard
& Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds
thereon, the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or
any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated
by Section 2.7 for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange
Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to
make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any interest or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.
(i) Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned
Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.11)); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a
 
A-30
Table of Contents
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed, in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange
for the number of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as
practicable) an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price. The Certificate so surrendered will be
cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to
cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of
Certificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment
Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive
the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood
that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message” or such
other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated
Shares by (B) the Per Share Price. The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of Uncertificated Shares on the amount
payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7
may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting
such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such
transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made
to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.
(e) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
 
A-31
Table of Contents
If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time who have not theretofore surrendered or
transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9(f)
will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.
2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration
payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL). The
consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to
compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in
exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
2.12 Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any applicable Laws related to Taxes. To the extent that such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

assets owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept of “good standing” is applicable in
the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material

(other than the holders of the Excluded Shares (as defined in the opinion) and the Reinvestment Shareholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger
Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (it being understood and agreed that such
opinion is for the benefit of the Company Special Committee and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person). As of the date of
this Agreement, to the Company’s Knowledge, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified. The Company shall, promptly following the

system was effective. Since the Lookback Date, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have each made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received notice

financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance
with appropriate authorizations of the Company’s management and the Company Board; and (iii) provide assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge

material weakness (each as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) in the system of internal control over financial reporting utilized by the

the “Equity Financing”), and (ii) a fully executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and among Parent and the Debt

A-52

applicable, of the Equity Financing, other than the Equity Commitment Letter. Other than Section 2 of the Support Agreement entered into with KKR,
there are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements that would permit the parties to any Commitment Letter to reduce the amount of the Financing
provided therein, impose additional conditions precedent or that would otherwise materially affect the availability of the Debt Financing or the Equity
Financing on the Closing Date.
(c) Sufficiency of Financing. The aggregate amounts committed pursuant to the Commitment Letters, subject to the satisfaction of the
terms and conditions thereunder will be sufficient, together with cash on hand at the Company on the Closing Date, to (i) satisfy all payment obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to

equity. Other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding,
investing or use of the full proceeds of the Financing pursuant to any agreements relating to the Financing to which each Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Affiliates is a party. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the
Commitment Letters has committed any breach of any of its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, any Commitment Letter. As
of the date hereof, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would, or would reasonably be
expected to, (i) constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of Parent or Merger Sub (or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the
Commitment Letters) under the Commitment Letters; (ii) constitute or result in a failure by Parent or Merger Sub (or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
party to the Commitment Letters) to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in any of the Commitment Letters; or (iii) otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing not being available on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, neither Parent nor Merger Sub have any reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any “flex” provisions

be satisfied by it, whether or not such condition is contained in the Commitment Letters or the Fee Letters; or (B) the full amounts committed pursuant to
the Commitment Letters will not be available on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to
be fully paid, all applicable fees, expenses, premiums and charges that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with
the Financing.

5.4 No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals.
(a) No Solicitation. Subject to Section5.4(b), immediately following execution of this Agreement and throughout the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company will cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room access (or other access to diligence)
of, any Person and its Representatives relating to an Acquisition Transaction or Acquisition Proposal that would otherwise be prohibited by this Section
5.4(a). Unless the Company has already so requested, promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company will request that each Person (other
than Parent and its Representatives) that has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with its
consideration of an Acquisition Transaction or Acquisition Proposal promptly return or destroy, in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality
agreement, all non-public information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement.
Subject to this Section 5.4(a) and Section 5.4(b), during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective directors and
officers, will not, and the Company will not authorize or direct, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ other employees,
consultants and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or

any of their respective Representatives in their capacity as such) access to the business, properties, assets,
 
A-58
Table of Contents
books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any such case in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an
Acquisition Proposal or the making of any offer, inquiry, indication of interest or proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person or Group with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or with
respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to any offer, indication of interest or proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than
informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 5.4 or discussing any Acquisition Proposal made by any Person or Group with such

indication of interest or proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent,

memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”); or (vi) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company will not be required to enforce, and, if requested, will be permitted to waive, any provision of any “standstill” or confidentiality agreement to the
extent that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof,
including the Company Special Committee).
(b) Permitted Conduct Related to Certain Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, from the date of this
Agreement until the Company’s receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof, including
the Company Special Committee) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their respective Representatives (including the Company Special
Committee Financial Advisor), following the execution and delivery of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (i) participate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with; or (ii) (1) furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to or (2) afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, in each
case, any Person or Group or their respective Representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to the Company a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach in any material respect of Section 5.4(a). The Company and the Company Board
(or a committee thereof, including the Company Special Committee) may only take the actions contemplated by the preceding sentence if the Company
Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special Committee has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.4(b) would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law (such determination, a “Qualified Acquisition Proposal Determination”). During
the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours following the disclosure thereof) make available to Parent and its
Representatives any such non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that was provided to any such Person or its
representatives that was not previously made available to Parent.
(c) No Company Recommendation Change or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except as provided by Section 5.4(d), at
no time after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a committee thereof, including the Company Special Committee):

amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to

Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within 10 Business Days after

Parent so requests in writing (it being understood that the Company will not be obligated to affirm the Company Recommendation on more than three
occasions); (D) make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such
offer or the issuance of a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof, including the Company Special
Committee) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication);
(E) fail to recommend against acceptance of any third party tender or exchange offer for the shares of Company Common Stock within 10 Business Days
after commencement of such offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act; (F) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;
or (G) resolve or publicly propose to take any action described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (F) (any action described in clauses (A) through (G),
a “Company Recommendation Change”), it being understood that none of (1) the determination in and of itself by the Company Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special Committee that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal; (2) the delivery, in and of itself, by the Company to Parent and its Representatives of any notice contemplated by
Section 5.4(d); or (3) the public disclosure, in and of itself, of the items in clauses (1) and (2) if required by applicable Law, will constitute a Company
Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.4; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
(d) Permissible Company Recommendation Change and Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
(i) Intervening Events. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the
Company Special Committee, or the Company Special Committee may effect a Company Recommendation Change of the type described in clauses (A),
(C), (F) and (G) (but clause (G) solely with respect to clauses (A) (C) and (F)) thereof, in response to an Intervening Event if and only if:
(1) the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
(2) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance to the effect that the
Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special Committee has (A) so determined and (B)
resolved to effect a Company Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.4(d)(i), which notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable
detail; and
(3) prior to effecting such Company Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives, until 5:00 p.m. at the end
of such four (4) Business Day period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that the failure to make a
Company Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would no longer reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable Law, as determined in good faith by the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special
Committee, or the Company Special Committee (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel); and (B) permitted Parent and its
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Special Committee regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the
extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being understood that at the end of such four Business Day period, the Company Board,
acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special Committee must have in
 
A-60

good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law.
(ii) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special Committee has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee,
or the Company Special Committee may (A) effect a Company Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal or (B) authorize the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, in each case if and only if:
(1) the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4 with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal;
(3) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance (the “Notice Period”)
to the effect that the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special Committee has (A)
received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h), which notice will describe the basis for such Company Recommendation Change or
termination, including the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and include
copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal (including any financing commitments); and
(4) prior to effecting such Company Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, until 5:00
p.m. on the last day of the Notice Period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Special
Committee regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being
understood that (a) in the event of any change to the form or amount of consideration or any other material revision, amendment, update or supplement
to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.4(d)(ii)(4) with respect to such new written notice (with the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice being three (3) Business Days); and
(b) at the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special
Committee must have in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that such bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.
(e) Notice to Parent of Acquisition Proposals. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, by the earlier
of (i) 24 hours from the receipt thereof or (ii) 5:00 p.m. on the next Business Day) notify Parent in writing if an Acquisition Proposal is received by, any
non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or

must include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any
confidentiality agreement with such Person or Group that is in effect on the date of this Agreement); and (B) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such proposal and, if in writing, a copy thereof. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in
any event within 24 hours), of the status and terms of, any developments regarding, any such Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments thereto)
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including by providing copies of all written materials sent to or from the Company or any of its
Representatives relating to such Acquisition Proposal.
(f) Permitted Disclosures by the Company and the Company Board. So long as the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of
the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special Committee expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such public disclosure (other
than in a customary “stop, look and listen” communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act),
subject to compliance with Section 6.14, nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company Board or the Company Special Committee from (A) taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-
9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including making a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company Board or the Company Special

outside legal counsel, has determined in good faith is required by applicable Law (it being understood that any such action or disclosure that constitutes
a Company Recommendation Change shall be made only in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section 5.4).
(g) Breach of No-Solicitation Obligations by Representatives of the Company. The Company agrees that it (i) will not authorize, direct or
permit any director, officer employee or other Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to breach this Section 5.4 and (ii) upon becoming
aware of any breach or threatened breach of this Section 5.4 by any director, officer, employee or other Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, shall use its reasonable best efforts to stop such breach or threatened breach. The Company agrees that any breach of this Section 5.4 by
any director, officer or other Representative (other than a consultant or an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is not an officer of the
Company) will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4 by the Company.
5.5 No Control of the Other Party’s Business. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are not intended
to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business or

and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have an obligation to offer, negotiate, commit to or effect any actions
contemplated by clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 6.2(b), if such action would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, further, that Parent or Merger Sub shall not be obligated to obtain “prior approval” or other affirmative approval

Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in no event more than three Business Days, following confirmation from the SEC that
it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement, which confirmation will be deemed to have occurred if the SEC has not
affirmatively notified the Company by 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth calendar day following such filing with the SEC that the SEC will or will
not be reviewing the Proxy Statement.

the Bylaws to establish a record date for (including conducting, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and in consultation with Parent, one or
more “broker searches” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act to enable such record date to be so set), duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (including any adjournment, postponement or other delay thereof, the “Company Stockholder

seeking advisory approval of a proposal in connection with a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may become payable to

A-66

Change, the Company will (A) submit this Agreement for adoption by a vote of the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (B)
use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval and the vote of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock required by applicable Law to effect the Merger.  
(b) Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company will be
permitted to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are holders of insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present
or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting; (ii) the Company is required
to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC; (iii) to ensure that any supplement or

Company Stockholder Meeting be changed without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless required by applicable Law.
6.5 Financing.
(a) No Amendments to Commitment Letters or Fee Letters. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub (without the prior written consent of the Company) will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, any Commitment Letter or Fee Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected
to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing, as applicable; (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of
the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing, as applicable, on or prior to Closing; (iii) otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing, as applicable, or any other terms to the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing, as applicable, in a
manner that, in each case with respect to this clause (iii), would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the occurrence of the Closing or
(B) make the timely funding of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Equity Financing or the
Debt Financing, less likely to occur in any material respect; or (iv) adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to any Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
Commitment Letter. Parent shall promptly notify the Company upon becoming aware of any fact, event or circumstance that could be reasonably likely to
make the funding of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing, on the conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters or the Debt Commitment
Letter, as applicable, less likely to occur. It is understood and agreed that Parent may, without the consent of the Company amend the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Fee Letter to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment
Letter and Debt Fee Letter as of the date of this Agreement, provided that the commitments of the initial lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter shall
not be reduced without the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(b) Taking of Necessary Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its
reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper and advisable to obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters (including after giving effect to any “flex” terms contained therein or in any
Fee Letter),
 
A-67
Table of Contents
including (A) using its reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the Commitment Letters in accordance with their respective terms and subject to the
conditions thereof; (B) complying with its obligations under each Commitment Letter and Fee Letter; (C) satisfying on a timely basis the conditions to
funding the Financing in each Commitment Letter and Fee Letter, if any, that are within its control; (D) using its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing; (E) complying with its obligations pursuant to each Commitment Letter and Fee Letter; (F) negotiating, executing and
delivering definitive agreements with respect to the Financing that reflect the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letters (including,
without limitation after giving full effect to any “flex” provisions contained therein or in the Fee Letters); and (G) enforcing its rights pursuant to each
Commitment Letter.
(c) Information from Parent. Parent will keep the Company informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub must give the Company prompt notice (A) of any breach
(or breach that has been threatened in writing) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by Parent or Merger Sub or, to Parent or Merger Sub’s knowledge, any other party to any of
the Commitment Letters or Fee Letters; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or communication from any party to any of the
Commitment Letters with respect to any (1) breach (or threatened breach), default, termination or repudiation by any party to a Commitment Letter, Fee
Letter, or any definitive agreements related to the Financing or any provisions of such Commitment Letter, Fee Letter, or such definitive agreements or (2)
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Commitment Letter or Fee Letter with respect to this Agreement, any Commitment Letter,
Fee Letter, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the Financing, other than in disputes regarding the negotiation of the
definitive documentation in respect thereof, but not with respect to the enforceability of any of the foregoing; and (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger
Sub at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated
by the Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent will provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a written request therefor to Parent. Parent shall provide the Company with complete, correct
and executed copies of any material amendment, modification or replacement (it being understood that any amendments, modifications or replacements
shall only be as permitted herein) of any Commitment Letter (or any of the Fee Letters, subject to customary redactions as provided above) promptly
following their execution.
(d) Enforcement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.5 will require,
and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any
enforcement action against any source of Equity Financing or to enforce its rights pursuant to any Equity Commitment Letter, or (ii) seek the Equity
Financing or Debt Financing (other than as provided in Section 6.6(b) and Section 6.6(e) below) from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any
amount in excess of that contemplated by the applicable Commitment Letter.
6.6 Debt Financing Cooperation.
(a) Cooperation by the Company with the Debt Financing. Prior to the Effective Time, upon request by Parent, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts, to provide all
cooperation as may be customary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing, including, without limitation, to:

required to provide any information or assistance relating to (A) the proposed aggregate amount of debt and equity financing, together with assumed
interest rates, dividends (if any) and fees and expenses relating to the incurrence of such debt or equity financing; (B) any post-Closing or pro forma cost
savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information used in connection with the
Debt Financing; or (C) any financial information related to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any adjustments that are not directly related to the
acquisition of the Company by Parent;

Parent or the Debt Financing Sources, and otherwise necessary to facilitate the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of such financing
documents and the pledging of collateral and the granting of security interests and perfection thereof in respect of the Debt Financing, it being
understood that such documents will not be recorded or take effect until the Effective Time;
(iv) upon request, furnish Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Sources, as promptly as practicable, with (A) audited financial

Credit Agreement as of the proposed payoff date together with any prepayment premiums, breakage costs, and other expenses and fees incurred in
connection with the repayment thereof), and indicating that upon repayment of all such outstanding obligations (other than contingent and expense
reimbursement obligations not yet due) arising under or relating to such Credit Agreement shall be repaid and extinguished in full, and that upon receipt
of such amount, all security interests thereunder will be automatically terminated and all liens automatically released, along with (ii) customary lien
releases relating to such liens; and
(vii) furnish Parent and the Debt Financing Sources no later than 3 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with all documentation
and other information about the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested by Parent at least nine (9) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, in accordance with the requirements of the Debt Financing Sources, and that is required by regulatory authorities pursuant to applicable “know
your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act and the requirements of 31 C.F.R. §1010.230.
(b) Alternative Financing. In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and subject to the
conditions (including any “flex” provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters (other than as a result of a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other provision of this Agreement by the Company), to fund the Required Amount, Parent shall, to
 
A-69
Table of Contents
the extent permitted by the Debt Commitment Letter, use its reasonable best efforts to replace the unavailable portion of Debt Financing with alternative
financing arrangements; provided that such alternative financing arrangements (i) provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of
the Equity Financing and other sources of readily available liquidity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on the Closing
Date, to fund the Required Amount, (ii) are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as determined by Parent in good faith) than those set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letters (the “Alternate Debt Financing”), and (iii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with
respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the “New Debt Commitment Letters”), which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt
Commitment Letter in whole or in part. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letters
in connection therewith, subject to customary redaction as described above).

Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt
Financing will be effective until the Effective Time; (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any action pursuant to any

information (a) the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under applicable Law or any agreement, contract or understanding binding on the

goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) solely in connection with a description of the Company, its business and products or the Merger;

respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and
Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such information to any Debt Financing Sources or prospective financing sources and other financial
institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in
connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto; or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of
which the Company is a beneficiary.
(g) Reimbursement. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-

from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with their cooperation in arranging or obtaining the Debt Financing (including any
cooperation pursuant to Section 6.6(a) pursuant to this Agreement or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith), provided that Parent
shall not be liable to the extent such liabilities have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives, or by information provided by the Company that is false or misleading in any material respect. Parent’s
obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(g) and this Section 6.6(h) are referred to collectively as the “Reimbursement Obligations.”

financing to any Person, in each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in connection with the
Merger.
(j) No Financing Condition. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to
the Closing. If any Debt Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company will have the option, but not the
obligation, of having an appropriate senior officer of the Company provide any solvency certificate required or requested to be provided by any of the
Financing Sources in connection with the Closing or otherwise.
6.7 Anti-Takeover Laws. Neither Parent nor the Company will take any action that would cause any restrictions on business combinations set forth
in the Charter or any “takeover” Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or the Merger. Each of Parent, the Company and the Company Board will (a) take all actions within their power to ensure that any
 
A-71
Table of Contents
restrictions on business combinations set forth in the Charter or any “anti-takeover” Law are not or do not become applicable to this Agreement, the
Support Agreements, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the Merger; and (b) if any restriction on business combinations set forth in the
Charter or applicable “anti-takeover” Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or the Merger, take all action within their power to ensure that this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or
minimize the effect of such restriction or Law on this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and the
Merger.
6.8 Information Access During the Pre-Closing Period. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, afford
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and records,
and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as requested in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or planning with respect to post-closing integration, operations or value creation and promptly provide Parent and its Representatives with all
reasonably requested information regarding the business of the Company and such additional information regarding the Company as Parent may
reasonably request, in each case, that are requested in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
planning with respect to post-closing integration, operations or value creation. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, the Company may restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or is otherwise bound would violate, or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate
rights pursuant to, such Contract; (d) such access would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of any third Person; or (e) such documents or
information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, provided, however, that in such instances, the Company shall inform Parent of the general nature of the information being
withheld and, upon Parent’s request, reasonably cooperate with Parent to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that would not result
in any of the outcomes described in the foregoing clauses (a) through (e). Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures, health and safety measures, and insurance requirements, and will not include
the right to perform any “invasive” testing or soil, air or groundwater sampling, including any Phase II environmental assessments without the prior
written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may satisfy its obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8 by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under applicable public health or similar Laws or
measures.
6.9 Section 16(b) Exemption. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by each individual who is a director or
executive officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b 3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
6.10 Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.
(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person
 
A-72
Table of Contents
who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively, the “Indemnified
Persons”). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation,
bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable,
as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period or such period in which an Indemnified Person is asserting a claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.10(b), whichever is longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required
by applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective Time, each Indemnified Person (in their capacity as such) from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified
Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action
or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent) (any such Legal Proceeding, an “Indemnified Party
Proceeding”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent
a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In connection with an Indemnified Party Proceeding, (A) the Surviving
Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time; (B) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to repay any amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the Surviving
Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such
Indemnified Party Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Indemnified Party Proceeding; and (C)
no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal
Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent
or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Indemnified Party Proceeding. No
Indemnified Person shall compromise, settle or consent to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or consent to an arrangement
regarding, any Indemnified Party Proceeding for which indemnification is or will be sought under this Section 6.10(b) unless Parent has consented thereto
in writing and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any liability for any such compromise, settlement or arrangement effected without
Parent’s prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 6.10(b) shall not modify, amend, remove or otherwise alter
any indemnification obligations of the Company set forth in the Charter, Bylaws or any indemnification agreements.

(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the D&O Insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to
those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay
aggregate premiums in excess of 300 percent of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300 percent amount, the
“Maximum Premium”). If the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the
D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Company may (and, at Parent’s request, shall) purchase a prepaid “tail” policy (the “Tail Policy”)
with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for the Tail Policy does not exceed the Maximum Premium, it being understood that if the aggregate cost
would exceed that limit, the Company may (and, at Parent’s request, shall) purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable up to such limit. If the
Company does not purchase a Tail Policy prior to the Closing, Parent shall have the right, in lieu of maintaining the D&O Insurance pursuant to this
Section 6.10(c), to purchase a Tail Policy. If the Company purchases the Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so
long as the Tail Policy is in full force and effect.
(d) Successors and Assigns. Proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10 if Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person.
(e) No Impairment; Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the
Tail Policy are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to this Section
6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law.
(f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and
officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

6.11 Employee Matters.
(a) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section 3.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating any such Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.
(b) Employment; Benefits. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or one
of its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all Continuing Employees immediately following the Effective Time by taking such actions, if any, as
are required by applicable Law. After the Effective Time and until December 31, 2023, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) (i) provide the Continuing Employees with employee benefits (other than the opportunity to
participate in employee stock purchase plans, equity or equity-based benefits, retention, change in control, nonqualified deferred compensation,
incentive, bonus or transaction benefits, defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation or post-employment welfare benefit plans or
arrangements (collectively, the “Excluded Arrangements”)) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on terms and conditions that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement under the Company Benefit
Plans set forth under Section 3.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and (ii) provide annual base salary, base wages and short-term target cash
incentive opportunities to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary, base wages and
short-term target cash incentive opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, base salary,
base wages and short-term target cash incentive compensation opportunities (other than the Excluded Arrangements) will not be decreased following the
Effective Time until December 31, 2023, for any Continuing Employee employed during that period. After the Effective Time and until December 31, 2023,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide to Continuing Employees who are terminated without cause
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement under the
Company Benefit Plans set forth under Section 3.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(c) New Plans. At or after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent to, cause
to be granted to the Continuing Employees credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting (other than vesting of
future equity awards), for purposes of future vacation accrual under the Company’s current plan and for purposes of determining severance pay
entitlement, to the same extent that such service was recognized for similar purposes under the Company Benefit Plans, except that such service need not
be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits, and shall not include the Excluded Arrangements. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each
Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Benefit Plans) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces
coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any
Continuing Employee, all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements
and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents (to the
same extent such conditions, limitations or requirements were met or otherwise not applicable to such Continuing Employee under the Old Plans as of the
Effective Time), and any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under an Old Plan providing group
health benefits during the portion of the plan year of the
 
A-75
Table of Contents
Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such
New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New
Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the
account of such Continuing Employee if participation under a New Plan flexible spending account plan occurs mid-year. Any vacation or paid time off
accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the
Effective Time.
(d) No Third Person Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither this Section 6.11 nor
any provisions of this Agreement relating to Company Benefit Plans will be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) require
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to maintain or continue any Company Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification, suspension or termination thereof or under any other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement after the Effective Time; (iii) create any
third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) be treated as establishment of or an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any Company Benefit
Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement.
(e) Employee Communications and Consultations. From and after the date hereof until the Closing, the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to review and comment on any broad-based communications to be distributed to or shared with Service Providers relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or terms of employment (and shall consider and incorporate in good faith any comments so provided by Parent).
6.12 Obligations. Parent will take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations
pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Company will
take all action necessary to cause its Subsidiaries to perform their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
6.13 Notification of Certain Matters.
(a) Notification by the Company. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by the Company to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing. No such
notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company that is set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement.
(b) Notification by Parent. During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent will give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied at the
Closing. No such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub that is set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement.

(c) Impact of Non-Compliance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a breach of the obligations of the Company or
Parent under this Section 6.13 will not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether any conditions set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied.
6.14 Public Statements and Disclosure. The initial press release concerning this Agreement and the Merger will be a joint press release reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent and will be issued promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Thereafter, unless the
Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, or the Company Special Committee has made a Company
Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives, on
the other hand, will consult with the other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts,
institutional investors or other similar Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are public or are reasonably likely to become public, in each case to
the extent relating to this Agreement or the Merger and neither party shall issue any press release or make any public announcement or statement without
the consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that to the extent such release or
announcement is required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association upon which the
securities of the Company are listed, the party required to make the release, announcement or statement shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with
the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release, announcement or
statement in advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Company will be obligated to engage in such consultation
with respect to communications that are (i) principally directed to its employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors so long as such
communications are consistent with prior communications previously agreed to by Parent and the Company and do not add additional material
information not included in such previous communication (in which case such communications may be made consistent with such plan); (ii) related to a
Superior Proposal or Company Recommendation Change or, in each case, any action taken pursuant thereto; (iii) with respect to any dispute or Legal

disclosures made by the Parties in compliance with this Section 6.14 and which do not add additional material information not included in such previous
disclosure. Parent will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications that are principally directed to its existing or
prospective general or limited partners, equity holders, members and investors of Parent or its Affiliates, so long as such communications are consistent
with prior communications previously agreed to by Parent and the Company and do not add additional material information not included in such previous
communication.
6.15 Transaction Litigation.
(a) Notice. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will provide Parent with prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation (including by
providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Notwithstanding anything

to the Transaction Litigation by the Company, and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation, which the

other manner, any business of any Person or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or equity
interests, or take any other action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such transaction would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Merger, including by (i) imposing any material delay in the obtaining
of, or materially increasing the risk of not obtaining, any consent of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Merger or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increasing the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger; or (iii) materially increasing the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise. Other than filings

companies” of Parent or such Affiliates as such term is customarily defined in the private equity industry) shall make any filing pursuant to the HSR Act
that would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of
any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period or (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or (iii)
materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise.
6.21 Prohibition on Certain Discussions. Except as approved by the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special

by such Party’s breach or other failure to comply with or perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(h) by the Company (at any time prior to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval) if (i) the Company has received a Superior Proposal;

8.2 Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination.
(a) Manner of Termination. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) must
deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable detail the provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement
is being terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the basis for such termination.
(b) Effect of Termination. Any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the mutual
written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties, as applicable. Following the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party (or any equity
holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other Representative of such Party) to the
other Parties, as applicable, except, and subject in all respects to this Section 8.2, that Section 6.6(i), Section 6.6(j), Section 6.14, Section 8.3, Article IX and
this Section 8.2 will each survive the termination of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, but subject to Section 8.3(f), nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party from any liability for any fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement
prior to the termination of this Agreement (provided that under no circumstances will the amount payable by Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement (other than in the event the Merger is consummated) (including any payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any monetary damages for
fraud or Willful Breach or for any other reason) exceed, in the aggregate, the amount of the Parent Termination Fee plus the Reimbursement Obligations
plus any Enforcement

Expenses). No termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guarantees
or the Equity Commitment Letters, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their
respective terms.
8.3 Fees and Expenses.
(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger will be
paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.9(d), Parent will pay or cause to be paid all
(i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each case arising out of or in
connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger.
(b) Company Payments.
(i) Future Transactions. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e); (B) following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), a “bona fide”
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed; and (C) within one year of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement
providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction, then the Company will, concurrently with the earlier of the consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction or the entry into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Transaction, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its
designee an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b)
(which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time). For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i) (other than with respect to clause (B) all references to
“15 percent” and “85 percent” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50 percent”, and with respect to clause
(B) all references to “15 percent” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “40 percent” and all references to “85
percent” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “60 percent”).
(ii) Company Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company must,
within two Business Days following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time).
(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must, concurrently with
such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time).
(iv) Requisite Stockholder Approval. If the Company or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d), then the
Company shall reimburse Parent for its reasonable and documented third party transaction expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of the
transactions contemplated hereby within two (2) Business Days after the later of such termination or Parent’s provision to the Company of
documentation of all such expenses by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be
updated by Parent from time to time); provided, however, in no event shall any such reimbursement of transaction expenses payable under this Section
8.3(b)(iv) exceed $15,000,000).
(c) Parent Payment. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i), then Parent must, within two
Business Days following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company
 
A-83
Table of Contents
or its designee an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule
8.3(c) (which Schedule may be updated by the Company from time to time).
(d) Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company or Parent be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination
Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times
and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as
and when required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.3 will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.
(e) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(c) or any portion thereof, as
applicable, then the non-paying party will pay or cause to be paid to the other party the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) of the other party in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such
amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal or other authoritative source on the date that
such payment or portion thereof was required to be made) plus five percent through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received,
or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (collectively, “Enforcement Expenses”) (provided, however, in no event shall any
Enforcement Expenses payable under this Section 8.3(e) exceed $2,500,000).
(f) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.
(i) For the Company Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company’s receipt of the
Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c), the Reimbursement Obligations, and any Enforcement Expenses to the extent owed
pursuant to Section 8.3(e), in each case from Parent (or the Guarantors under the Guarantees), and the Company’s right to specific performance pursuant
to Section 9.10(b) will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties in respect of this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or any other agreement
executed in connection herewith, the termination of this Agreement, any matters forming the basis of such termination, the failure to consummate the
Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising therefrom (except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Section 8.3(f)(i)). Upon
payment of, in each case, to the extent required, the Parent Termination Fee, the Reimbursement Obligations and any Enforcement Expenses by Parent (or
the Guarantors under the Guarantees), none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of the Company Related
Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Transaction Documents or any other agreement executed in connection herewith, the termination of this Agreement, any matters forming the basis of
such termination, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable
 
A-84
Table of Contents
Law arising therefrom, except that the Parties or their respective applicable Affiliates (or both) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(i) will not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub from any liability (1) for any fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, except that under no circumstances will the amount
payable by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement (other than in the event the Merger is consummated) (including any payment of the Parent
Termination Fee and any monetary damages including for fraud or Willful Breach) exceed, in the aggregate, the amount of the Parent Termination Fee plus
the Reimbursement Obligations plus any Enforcement Expenses, or (2) for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement and in no event shall Parent be
required to pay both damages under this Agreement and the Parent Termination Fee. In no event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or obtain,
nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award (other than
(1) the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c), the Reimbursement Obligations, and any Enforcement Expenses, in each case
(1) the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c), the Reimbursement Obligations, and any Enforcement Expenses, in each case
from Parent (or the Guarantors under the Guarantees), (2) any monetary recovery or award for a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement or (3) subject to
the limitations in this Section 8.3(f)(i), monetary recovery or award for fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement) against any Parent Related Parties, and
in no event will the Company be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages (other than (1) the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c), the Reimbursement Obligations, and any Enforcement
Expenses, in each case from Parent (or the Guarantors under the Guarantees), (2) any monetary recovery or award for a breach of the Confidentiality
Agreement, or (3) subject to the limitations in this Section 8.3(f)(i), monetary recovery or award for fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement) against any
Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the Merger, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Transaction Documents or any other agreement executed in connection herewith, the termination of this Agreement, any matters forming the basis
of such termination, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising therefrom. Nothing in this Section 8.3(f)(i)
will preclude any liability of the Debt Financing Sources to Parent or Merger Sub under the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing or limit
Parent or Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any Debt Financing Source pursuant to
the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing.
(ii) For the Parent Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 in a situation in which the
Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and paid, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee and any Enforcement
Expenses to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(f) will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related
Parties in respect of this Agreement (except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Section 8.3(f)(ii)), the Transaction Documents, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, any matters forming the basis of such termination, or
the failure to consummate the Merger (except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Section 8.3(f)(ii)). Following the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, including upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and any Enforcement Expenses in a situation in which the
Company Termination Fee is payable and is paid, none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of the Parent
Related Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising therefrom.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(ii) will not relieve the Company from any liability for any fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement or
pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable and in no event will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award (except pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable) against the Company Related Parties (excluding the Company). If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1in a situation in which the Company Termination Fee is not payable, the Company’s liability shall be limited to liability
arising from any fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, other than the obligations of the Company provided in this
Agreement, no Company

purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing. It is
understood and agreed that, in each case, such assignment shall not (i) affect the obligations of the parties to any debt commitment letter (or definitive
agreements) related to the Debt Financing, to the Equity Commitment Letters or to the Guarantees; or (ii) impede or delay the consummation of the
Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity-Based Awards pursuant to this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective

to in this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Guarantees and the Equity
Commitment Letters, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior

to the contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c)
continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the (i) Effective Time and (ii) date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in

and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement.
This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies under this Agreement, except (a) as set forth in or

to be a third-party beneficiary thereof with full rights of enforcement.
9.9 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
9.10 Remedies.
(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Transaction Document or
otherwise, although the Company may, subject in all respects to Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 9.16 and this Section 9.10 (and, in each case, the
limitations set forth herein or therein), pursue both (i) a grant of specific performance, and (ii) payment of monetary damages pursuant to Section 8.3(c) or
the Parent Termination Fee, under no circumstances will the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing, and receipt of the Parent Termination Fee or monetary damages of any kind.
(b) Specific Performance.
(i) Irreparable Damage. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such
actions that are required of it by this Agreement in order to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree unless and until this Agreement is validly terminated in
 
A-89
Table of Contents
accordance with Section 8.1, that (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the
terms of this Agreement (other than Parent and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (or, in the case of KKR, satisfied with
Rollover Shares pursuant to the Support Agreement) and to effect the Closing, which shall be governed solely by the next sentence), (B) the Parties will
not assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto further agree that unless and until this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the
Company shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (or, in the case of KKR, satisfied with Rollover Shares pursuant to the Support Agreement) and effect the
Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein if and only if and for so long as (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided that each such condition would be satisfied if the Closing
were on such date) have been and continue to be satisfied or waived and Parent failed to consummate the Closing on the date required pursuant to the
terms of Section 2.1, (B) the Debt Financing (or, as applicable, any alternative financing) is available to be funded in full at the Closing and has been
funded in full or will be funded in full if the Equity Financing is funded and (C) the Company has confirmed (which confirmation must be irrevocable for a
period of at least (5) five Business Days) in writing that if the Financing is funded, then the Company shall take such actions that are required of it by this
Agreement to consummate the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Closing
within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such irrevocable confirmation (such clauses (A), (B) and (C), together, the “Specific Performance
Conditions”). For the avoidance of doubt, (a) in no event shall the Company be entitled to specifically enforce (or to bring any action or proceeding in
equity seeking to specifically enforce) Parent’s rights under the Equity Commitment Letter to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (or, in the case of
KKR, satisfied with Rollover Shares pursuant to the Support Agreement) or to effect the Closing other than as expressly provided in the immediately
preceding sentence and (b) in no event shall the Company, Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to specifically enforce the obligation of Parent and Merger
Sub under this Agreement to consummate the Closing other than under the circumstances expressly set forth in this Section 9.10(b). Subject to the two
preceding sentences, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that any other of such parties has an adequate remedy at law or that any such injunction or award of specific performance or other equitable
relief is not an appropriate remedy; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parent’s or
Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (or, in the case of KKR, satisfied with Rollover Shares pursuant to the Support
Agreement) and to effect the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub may oppose the granting of specific performance on the basis that one of the Specific
Performance Conditions has not been satisfied.
(ii) No Objections; Cooperation. Subject in all respects to Section 9.10(b)(i), the Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties pursuant to this
Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. Each Party
agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in seeking and agreeing to an expedited schedule in any litigation
seeking an injunction or order of specific performance.

notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Corporation’s

every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting; provided, however, if the record date for

the tenth day before the meeting date arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the

Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the
meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice
of the meeting, and/or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation
determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available
only to stockholders of the Corporation.
Section 6 Quorum. The holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, entitled to vote thereon, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by statute, or by the Corporation’s
certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present, the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting,
and entitled to vote at the meeting, may adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place.
Section 7 Adjourned Meetings. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, (including an adjournment taken to address a technical
failure to convene or continue a meeting using remote communication), notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any,
thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at
such adjourned meeting are (i) announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, (ii) displayed, during the time scheduled for the meeting, on
the same electronic network used to enable stockholders and proxy holders to participate in the meeting by means of remote communication or (iii) set
forth in the notice of meeting given in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation
may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the
adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders
entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the board of directors shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at
such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.
Section 8 Vote Required. When a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the question is one upon which by express provisions of an
applicable law, the
Table of Contents
Corporation’s certificate of incorporation or these by-laws (including Article III, Section 2) a different vote is required, in which case such express
provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
Section 9 Voting Rights. Except as otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or by the Corporation’s certificate
of incorporation or any amendments thereto and subject to Section 3 of Article VI hereof, every stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be
entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of common stock held by such stockholder.
Section 10 Proxies. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after
three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if,
and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of
whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. Any proxy is suspended when the
person executing the proxy is present at a meeting of stockholders and elects to vote, except that when such proxy is coupled with an interest and the
fact of the interest appears on the face of the proxy, the agent named in the proxy shall have all voting and other rights referred to in the proxy,
notwithstanding the presence of the person executing the proxy. At each meeting of the stockholders, and before any voting commences, all proxies filed
at or before the meeting shall be submitted to and examined by the secretary or a person designated by the secretary, and no shares may be represented
or voted under a proxy that has been found to be invalid or irregular.
Section 11 Action by Written Consent. Unless otherwise provided in the Corporation’s certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken
at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action
at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation in the manner required by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. A consent must be set forth in writing or in an electronic transmission. No consent shall be effective to
take the corporate action referred to therein unless consents signed by a sufficient number of holders or members to take action are delivered to the
Corporation within sixty (60) days of the first date on which a consent is so delivered to the Corporation. Any person executing a consent may provide,
whether through instruction to an agent or otherwise, that such consent will be effective at a future time, including a time determined upon the happening
of an event, occurring not later than sixty (60) days after such instruction is given or such provision is made, if evidence of the instruction or provision is
provided to the Corporation. If the person is not a stockholder or member of record when the consent is executed, the consent shall not be valid unless
the person is a stockholder or member of record as of the record date for determining stockholders or members entitled to consent to the action. Unless
otherwise provided, any such consent shall be revocable prior to its becoming effective. The consent shall be delivered (i) to the principal place of
business of the Corporation, (ii) to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders
or members are recorded; (iii) to the registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested; or (iv) subject to the next sentence, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, to an information processing
system, if any, designated by the Corporation for receiving such consents. In the case of delivery pursuant to the foregoing clause (iv), such consent
must set forth or be delivered with information that enables the Corporation to determine the date of delivery of such consent and the identity of the
person giving such consent. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original
writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing. A consent may be documented and signed in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, and when so documented or signed shall be deemed to be in writing; provided that if such consent is delivered pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii)
of this Section 11 of this Article II, such consent must be reproduced and delivered in paper form. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous consent shall
Table of Contents
be given to those stockholders or members who have not consented and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that consents signed by a sufficient number of holders or members
to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.
ARTICLE III
DIRECTORS
Section 1 General Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the board of directors.
Section 2 Number, Election and Term of Office. The number of directors shall be established from time to time by resolution of the board of

Section 1 Indemnification of Directors and Offiers in Third Party Proceedings. Subject to the other provisions of this Article V, the Corporation
shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as now or hereinafter in effect, any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”) (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding if such person
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did
not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful.
Section 2 Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation. Subject to the other provisions of this Article
V, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as now or hereinafter in effect,
any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding by or in the right of the
Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
the defense or settlement of such Proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 3 Successful Defense. To the extent that a present or former director or officer (for purposes of this Section 3 of this Article V only, as such
term is defined in Section 145(c)(1) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article V, or in defense of any claim, issue
Table of Contents
or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in
connection therewith. The Corporation may indemnify any other person who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation against
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person to the extent he or she has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any suit or proceeding described in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article V, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein.

Corporation Law of the State of Delaware the determination of whether employees or agents shall be indemnified.
Section 5 Advaced Payment of Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by an officer or director of the
Corporation in defending any Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of a
written request therefor (together with documentation reasonably evidencing such expenses) and an undertaking by or on behalf of the person to repay
such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article V or the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware. Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and
agents of the Corporation or by persons serving at the request of the Corporation as directors, officers, employees or agents of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate. The
right to advancement of expenses shall not apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to these
by-laws, but shall apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) referenced in clause (b) and clause (c) of Section 6 of this Article V prior to a
determination that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant
to Section 8 of this Article V, no advance shall be made by the Corporation to an officer of the Corporation (except by reason of the fact that such officer
is or was a director of the Corporation, in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any Proceeding if a determination is reasonably and promptly
made (a) by a vote of the directors who are not parties to such Proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (b) by a committee of such directors
designated by the vote of the majority of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (c) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so
direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made
demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation.
Section 6 Limitation on Indemnification. Subject to the requirements in Section 3 of this Article V and the General Corporation Law of the State of

vested in the Corporation under applicable law, (iii) otherwise required to be made under Section 8.7 or (iv) otherwise required by applicable

of his or her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of expenses. The Corporation shall indemnify such person against any and all expenses
that are actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any action for indemnification or advancement of expenses from the

or advancement of expenses.
Section 8 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article V shall not

suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought, unless the provision in effect at the time of such act or omission
explicitly authorizes such elimination or impairment after such action or omission has occurred.
Section 12 Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Article V, references to the “Corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting company,
any constituent company (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had

such constituent company, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another

Section 1 Form. Shares of stock of the Corporation may be certificated or uncertificated, as provided under the General Corporation Law of the State

have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been placed upon, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or
officers of the Corporation whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate or certificates have been delivered by the
Corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or
certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the Corporation. All
certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name of the person to whom the shares represented thereby are
issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the books of the Corporation. Shares of stock of the Corporation shall only be

stamps. In that event, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate or
certificates, and record the transaction on its books. The board of directors may appoint a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United

We understand that KnowBe4, Inc. (the “Company”), Oranje Holdco, LLC, (“Parent”), and Oranje Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated October 11, 2022 (the “Merger

automatically converted into the right to receive $24.90 per share in cash, without interest (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger

You have requested our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other

dated October 10, 2022 and certain related documents; and
 
11)
Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available
or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the Financial Projections,
we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management
of the Company regarding the future financial performance of the Company. We express no view as to such Financial Projections or the assumptions on
which they were based. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions (the effect of which would be material to our analysis or this opinion),
including, among other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment Letters, and that the definitive
Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that, in connection with the
receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations,
conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed
Merger. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the
assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, or regulatory matters. Our opinion does not address the
relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be
achieved or are available. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s
officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Reinvestment Shareholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. We
have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or
appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us
as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a substantial
portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In addition,

Morgan Stanley or an affiliate thereof is a lender to the Company and certain of the Vista Related Entities and KKR Related Entities (each as defined
below) and has received, and may receive, fees in connection therewith. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory
and financing services to Vista (which we understand is the ultimate controlling equity owner of Parent) and its majority-controlled affiliates and portfolio
companies (collectively the “Vista Related Entities”), and KKR (which we understand is a co-investor or a party that may rollover certain amounts of its
shares of Company Common Stock in this transaction) and its majority-controlled affiliates and portfolio companies (collectively, the “KKR Related
Entities”) and, in each case, have received fees in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financing
services to the Company and have received fees in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date hereof, Morgan Stanley has not
provided financial advisory and financing services to Elephant Partners (which we understand is a party that will rollover certain amounts of its shares of
Company Common Stock in this transaction). Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and/or financing services to the Company,
Parent, Vista, the Vista Related Entities, KKR, the KKR Related Parties and Elephant Partners in the future and would expect to receive fees for the
rendering of these services.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth
management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities
and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its
affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions,
and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for its own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of
Vista, the Vista Related Entities, KKR, the KKR Related Entities, Elephant Partners, Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates, or any other
company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition, Morgan Stanley, its
affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with the Special Committee in connection with the Merger, may have committed and may
commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by Vista, the Vista Related Entities, KKR, the KKR Related Entities, Elephant Partners or in
affiliates of Morgan Stanley that may hold direct equity and/or partnership interests in private equity funds managed by Vista, the Vista Related Entities,
KKR or the KKR Related Entities.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with our customary
practice. This opinion is for the information of, and use by, the Special Committee and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without our
prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is required to make with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable law; provided, however, that an informational
copy of the opinion may be provided to the Board of Directors of the Company on a confidential and non-reliance basis. In addition, Morgan Stanley
expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the stockholders of the Company should vote at the stockholders’ meeting to be held in connection
with the Merger.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares and the Reinvestment Shareholders) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger
Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the Stockholder, the Company and Parent hereby agree as follows:
1. Agreement to Vote the Covered Shares; Proxy.
1.1 Beginning on the date hereof until the Termination Date (as defined below), at every meeting of the Company’s stockholders, including
any postponement, recess or adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstance, however called, the Stockholder agrees to, and if applicable, to cause its
controlled Affiliates to, affirmatively vote (including via proxy) or execute consents with respect to (or cause to be voted (including via proxy) or
consents to be executed with respect to) all of the Owned Shares and any additional shares of Common Stock or other voting securities of the Company
acquired by the Stockholder or its respective controlled Affiliates after the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date (collectively, and together with
the Owned Shares, the “Covered Shares”) as follows: (a) in favor of (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger, including
any amended and restated Merger Agreement or amendment to the Merger Agreement that, in any such case, (x) increases the Per Share Price or (y) other
than amendments covered by clause (x), amendments that otherwise result in the Merger Agreement being more favorable to the Company Stockholders
(solely in their capacity as such) than the Merger Agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement (excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any Adverse
Amendment), (ii) the approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone any Company Stockholder Meeting to a later date if the Company or Parent
proposes or requests such postponement or adjournment in accordance with Section 6.4(b) of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the approval of any other
proposal considered and voted upon by the Company Stockholders at any Company Stockholder Meeting necessary for consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (b) against (i) any proposal, action or agreement that would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement or that would reasonably be expected to result in any condition set forth in the Merger Agreement not being satisfied or not being fulfilled
prior to the Termination Date, (ii) any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, winding up or similar extraordinary
transaction involving the Company (except as contemplated by the Merger Agreement) and (iv) any other action, agreement or proposal which would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement (clauses (a) and (b) collectively, the “Supported Matters”). The Stockholder agrees to, and agrees to cause its applicable
controlled Affiliates to, be present, in person or by proxy, at every meeting of the Company’s stockholders, including any postponement, recess or
adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstance, however called, to vote on the Supported Matters (in the manner described in this Section 1.1) so that
all of the Covered Shares will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at such meeting, or otherwise cause the Covered Shares
to be counted as present threat for purposes of establishing a quorum. For the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect to the Supported Matters, the
Stockholder does not have any obligation to vote the Covered Shares in any particular manner and, with respect to such other matters (other than the
Supported Matters), the Stockholder shall be entitled to vote the Covered Shares in its sole discretion. Except as provided in Section 4.5 of this
Agreement, from and after the date hereof until the Termination Date, the Stockholder shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and the
Company, take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in the conversion of its shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A
Common Stock.
1.2 Proxy. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints, as its proxy and attorney-in-fact, Christina Lema and Gursimarjit Singh, each of
them individually, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote such Stockholder’s Covered Shares in accordance with Section 1.1 at the
Company Stockholder Meeting
 
C-2
Table of Contents
(including any postponement, recess or adjournment thereof) in respect of such Stockholder’s Covered Shares (to the extent such Covered Shares are
entitled to so vote) prior to the Termination Date at which any Supported Matters are to be considered; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt,
that the Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote such Stockholder’s Covered Shares (or to direct how such Covered Shares shall be voted) in
such Stockholder’s sole discretion on matters other than Supported Matters. This proxy is coupled with an interest, is (or will be, as applicable) given as
an additional inducement of Parent to enter into this Agreement and shall be irrevocable prior to the Termination Date, at which time any such proxy shall
terminate. Parent may terminate this proxy with respect to such Stockholder at any time at its sole election by written notice provided to such Stockholder.
2. Rollover.
2.1 Contribution and Exchange. On the terms set forth herein and subject to Section 2.2, Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and Section 2.5:
(a) The Stockholder agrees and covenants to Parent that it will, at the Exchange Time, contribute, assign, transfer, convey and deliver
(or cause to be contributed, assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered) to Topco the Rollover Shares, free and clear of any and all liens (including
any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of the Rollover Shares), except as may exist by reason of this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement and applicable securities laws, in exchange for the issuance by Topco to such Stockholder of, at the Exchange Time, the Exchange Shares (the
“Exchange”).
(b) Each Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Exchange, except as set forth in Section 2.2, such Stockholder
shall have no right, title or interest in or to the Rollover Shares.
(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Stockholder may, upon written notice to Parent delivered at least 10
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, distribute all or a portion of the Rollover Shares to its equityholders prior to Closing (solely to the
extent such equityholder (x) is a fund under common control with the Stockholder and (y) has executed prior to such distribution a joinder to this
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent agreeing to be bound by all of the terms hereof applicable to the Stockholder).
2.2 Conditions to Exchange. The obligations of each Stockholder to consummate the Exchange is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by
such Stockholder in writing) of the following conditions:
(a) (i) The satisfaction, or written waiver by Parent, of all conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that are to occur on the Closing Date as set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the
Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver by
Parent (to the extent permitted thereunder) of such conditions), (ii) the contemporaneous funding of the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing at the

2.4 Tax Treatment. Topco, Parent and the Stockholder intend that, for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income tax purposes, (a)
the Exchange, the Sponsor Contributions and the Other Investor Contributions be treated as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code,
pursuant to which the Stockholder, the Sponsors and the Other Investors will receive equity interests of Parent consisting “control,” within the meaning
of Section 368(c) of the Code and (b) the Conversion (as defined below) be treated as a non-taxable recapitalization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
(1)(E) of the Code (the “Intended Tax Treatment”). The Stockholder, the Company and Topco (including Parent on behalf of Topco) shall prepare and file
(and shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of, as reasonably requested) all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and
shall not take any position inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment in connection with any tax matters, in each case, unless otherwise required by a

2.6 Termination. Parent shall not be permitted terminate its obligations under this Section 2 without the written consent of the Stockholder
and Parent other than in accordance with Sections 4.3(a), Section 4.4 and Section 4.6 herein (it being understood that this Section 2 shall also be
terminated upon any termination of this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 3).
3. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate automatically and without further action upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the valid termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) the Effective Time, (iii) any amendment of the Merger Agreement, without the prior written consent of
Stockholder, that imposes any restriction on Stockholder’s right to receive the Per Share Price (other than immaterial restrictions), reduces the amount of
the Per Share Price or changes the form of the Per Share Price (such amendment, an “Adverse Amendment”) (such date, the “Termination Date”);
provided that the provisions set forth in Sections 15 through 28 shall survive the termination of this Agreement; and provided further that the termination
of this Agreement shall not prevent any party hereto from seeking any remedies (at law or in equity) against any other party hereto for that party’s Willful
Breach of this Agreement that may have occurred on or before such termination. For the purpose hereof, “Willful Breach” means a material breach of this
Agreement that is a consequence of an act or failure to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by or on behalf of the breaching party with the actual
knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a breach of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee (if received) from or on behalf
of the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against the Stockholder or any of its respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holders, general or limited partners, controlling persons, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or assignees
(excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) for any breach or failure to perform the Stockholder’ obligations under Section 4.1 hereof. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate liability of the Stockholder in connection with any Willful Breach of this
Agreement shall not exceed $3,270,540.00; provided, however that the aggregate liability of the Stockholder under this Agreement shall be increased to
(but shall not exceed) the amount of the Parent
 
C-4

Termination Fee that becomes payable to the Company by Parent, if and only if the Stockholder’s Willful Breach of the Stockholder’s obligations under
this Agreement caused the Parent Termination Fee to become payable by Parent to the Company under the express terms of the Merger Agreement. The
Stockholder, such Stockholder’s affiliated fund entities and its and their respective directors, officers and employees shall be deemed “Representatives”
of the Company for purposes of Section 5.4 of the Merger Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein (including in the preceding
sentence) shall in any way limit the Company’s liability under the Merger Agreement with respect to any breach of the Merger Agreement (including
Section 5.4 thereof).
4. Certain Covenants.

proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract (whether written, oral, binding or non-binding) relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Transaction; or (vi) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.1,
the Stockholder may, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, and furnish information and data to, any Person or Group or their
respective Representatives that have delivered to the Company a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, the Company Board (acting upon
the recommendation of the Company Special Committee) or the Company Special Committee has made a Qualified Acquisition Proposal Determination
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 5.4(b) of the Merger Agreement.
(b) Until the Expiration Time, the Stockholder (solely in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company) shall notify Parent promptly
and, in any event, within 24 hours following any discussion or negotiations with any person in connection with the last sentence of Section 4.1(a). Such

entity) following such transaction) and, if in writing, a copy thereof. Thereafter, the Stockholder must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis
(and in any event within 24 hours), of the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including by providing a summary of economic terms thereof
(including with respect to the Stockholder’s potential ownership stake in the Company (or a successor entity) following such transaction) and copies of

C-5
Table of Contents
Stockholder shall not be required to notify Parent of any discussions or negotiations to the extent the Company has notified Parent thereof.
4.2 Transfers. Beginning on the date hereof until the Termination Date, the Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that, except as
expressly contemplated pursuant to this Agreement, (a) the Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly (i) tender any Covered Shares into any tender or
exchange offer, (ii) offer, sell, transfer, assign, exchange, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, or otherwise dispose of (collectively, “Transfer”) or enter into
any contract, option, agreement, understanding or other arrangement with respect to the Transfer of, any Covered Shares or beneficial ownership, voting

into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any Covered Shares that is inconsistent with this Agreement, (iv) take an action that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Merger Agreement or (v) commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions. Any Transfer in violation of this Section 4.2 shall be void ab initio.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Stockholder may Transfer any or all of the Covered Shares, in accordance with applicable
Law, to Stockholder’s Affiliates; provided, that prior to and as a condition to the effectiveness of such Transfer, each Person to whom any of such
Covered Shares or any interest in any of such Covered Shares is or may be transferred shall have executed and delivered to Parent a counterpart of this
Agreement pursuant to which such Person shall be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement. In addition, any Transfer of Covered
Shares shall be permitted from and after the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained under the Merger Agreement so long as, after giving effect to
such Transfer, the Stockholders retain in the aggregate a number of Owned Shares at least equal to the Rollover Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall the Sjouwerman Foundation, Inc. or any entity owned by it be treated as an Affiliate of Stockholder for any purpose of
this Agreement or will the shares owned by the Sjouwerman Foundation, Inc. be treated as beneficially owned by the Stockholder.
4.3 Regulatory Matters.
(a) Subject to Section 4.4, the Stockholder shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Affiliates to, use their
reasonable best efforts, consistent with the time frames set forth in Section 6.4 of the Merger Agreement, to supply and provide information that, to such
Stockholder’s knowledge, is complete and accurate in all material respects to any Governmental Authority requesting such information in connection
with filings or notifications under, or relating to, applicable laws that are required or advisable as a result of, or pursuant to, the Merger Agreement and
the related financings and transactions, including, without limitation, information required or requested to be provided to any antitrust, financial or
national security regulatory authorities in connection with any approvals reasonably sought in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(collectively, the “Regulatory Filings” and the, “Regulatory Disclosures”, respectively). If any Governmental Authority seeks to prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement based on the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or based on any other
required approval, consent, notice or filing with a Governmental Authority and such actions by the Governmental Authority relate to the activities or
investments of such Stockholder or its Affiliates (solely for purposes of this Section 4, an “Affiliate” of the Stockholder shall include any portfolio
company in which such Stockholder or any of its Affiliates has made a debt or an equity investment), then if Parent in good faith reasonably determines
that such actions by the Governmental Authority will not be resolved sufficiently in advance of the Termination Date, Parent may provide written notice
of that determination to the Stockholder, and Parent may elect to terminate the obligations under Section 2 and Section 4.6 of this Agreement (in which
case the Stockholder’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter shall also automatically terminate) and, in that context, the Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Price under the Merger Agreement with respect to its shares of Common Stock; provided, however that Parent shall not
terminate the Equity Commitment Letter or the obligations under Section 2 of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.3(a) without first obtaining
alternative financing arrangements which provide Parent with funds in an amount equal to the Rollover Amount; provided that such alternative financing
arrangements (i) provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the Equity Financing, Debt
 
C-6
Table of Contents
Financing and other sources of readily available liquidity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to
fund the Required Amount and (ii) do not impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of such financing relative to the Commitment Letters that
could impair or delay the Closing. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any definitive commitment letter or other documentation
providing for such alternative financing arrangement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Stockholder may designate any Regulatory
Disclosures that contain sensitive, legally privileged, or confidential information in respect of the Stockholder or any of its Affiliates as exclusive to the
Stockholder and the Stockholder may provide that any such sensitive, legally privileged, or confidential information may only be provided on a counsel-
only basis or directly to the applicable Governmental Authority requesting such information. The Stockholder shall not make any filings, or notifications
in connection with the Merger pursuant to any Antitrust Laws without Parent’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Parent or the Company shall not file any Regulatory Filings that contain information with respect to the Stockholder or its affiliates without
first providing the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and will give good faith consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the Stockholder and its counsel.
(b) Each Stockholder hereto represent, warrant and covenant to Parent and to the Company that, to such Stockholder’s knowledge:
(i) none of the information supplied in writing by such Stockholder specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Regulatory Disclosures
will contain a material misstatement of fact or a material omission of fact necessary to make the information provided not misleading and (ii) it does not
permit any entity under the “control” (defined in Section 721 of the Defense Production Act, as amended, including all implanting regulations thereof) of
a People’s Republic of China national, or any entity under the control of a Russian Federation national, to obtain through any Affiliate, control with
respect to the Company.  
4.4 Limitations of Regulatory Disclosures. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Stockholder to (i) make available to Parent any of its internal investment committee
materials or analyses or, other than Regulatory Disclosures, any information which the Stockholder considers to be commercially sensitive information or
which is otherwise held subject to an obligation of confidentiality; and (ii) with respect to any Regulatory Disclosures, provide, or cause to be provided
or agree or commit to provide information where the sharing of such information as contemplated would be prohibited by applicable laws applicable to
the Stockholder or its Affiliates or any judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition
applicable to or imposed upon it or its Affiliates. If the Stockholder fails to provide any information referred to in this Section 4.4, and as a result of such
failure, the applicable Governmental Authority denies any regulatory approval or receipt of approval is reasonably expected, in Parent’s good faith
determination after consultation with its Antitrust Law advisors, to be materially delayed, then Parent may elect to terminate the obligations under Section
2 and Section 4.6 of this Agreement (in which case the Stockholder’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter shall also automatically terminate)
and, in that context, the Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Price under Merger Agreement with respect to its shares of Common Stock;
provided, however that Parent shall not terminate the Equity Commitment Letter or the obligations under Section 2 of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 4.4 without first obtaining alternative financing arrangements which provide Parent with funds in an amount equal to the Rollover Amount;
provided that such alternative financing arrangements (i) provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the Equity Financing, Debt
Financing and other sources of readily available liquidity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to
fund the Required Amount and (ii) do not impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of such financing relative to the Commitment Letters that
could impair or delay the Closing. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any definitive commitment letter or other documentation
providing for such alternative financing arrangement.
4.5 Conversion. Not later than eleven (11) days prior to the record date for the stockholder vote to approve the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, Sponsor shall deliver to the Company the notice contemplated by Article V, Section A of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the
 
C-7
Table of Contents
Company to immediately convert all of their respective shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock. After the date on which
Sponsor converts its Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, and in any event not later than ten (10) days prior to the record date for the
stockholder vote to approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder shall deliver to the Company the notice
contemplated by Article V, Section A of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to immediately convert all of its Rollover
Shares from shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Conversion”)
4.6 Consents. Parent agrees that it shall not enter into any amendment to the Merger Agreement that is materially adverse to the
Reinvestment Shareholders, excluding Sponsor (such parties, the “Requisite Shareholders”) without the prior written consent of the Requisite
Shareholders holding 66 % of the Rollover Shares held by all Requisite Shareholders (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, that for purposes of this Section 4.6, “materially adverse” shall be measured with respect to the Requisite Shareholders solely in their
capacities as investors with Parent in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and without regard to their existing ownership stake or
employment or other role in the Company or any consideration they will receive in connection with the Merger; provided, further, that any increase to the
Per Share Price that applies to all Stockholders shall not be considered materially adverse to the Requisite Shareholders and no consent shall be required
under this Section 4.6 for any such increase to the Per Share Price. The Requisite Shareholders shall respond with reasonable promptness to any requests
for consent pursuant to this Section 4.6, including at any time where one or more of the parties hereto has asserted that this Agreement has been
terminated but the validity of such termination is disputed and such dispute has not been resolved by agreement of the parties or a final, non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any Requisite Shareholder engages in discussions or negotiations with any Person or Group with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal, in each case in breach of Section
5.4 of the Merger Agreement, then this Section 4.6 shall immediately terminate and no such consent shall be required. In the event that any Requisite
Shareholder fails to consent to an amendment to the Merger Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.6, the parties hereto agree that Parent may (but is not
required to) terminate this Agreement if it has first obtained alternative financing arrangements which provide Parent with funds in an amount equal to the
Rollover Amount; provided that such alternative financing arrangements (i) provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the
Equity Financing, Debt Financing and other sources of readily available liquidity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on
the Closing Date, to fund the Required Amount and (ii) do not impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of such financing relative to the
Commitment Letters that could impair or delay the Closing. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any definitive commitment letter or
other documentation providing for such alternative financing arrangement.
5. Proxy Statement; Schedule 13e-3 and Schedule 13D.
(a) Promptly (but in no event later than 20 Business Days) after the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company will prepare
(with Parent’s reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders in connection with the Company
Stockholder Meeting (the proxy statement, including any amendments or supplements, the “Proxy Statement”). The Company, Parent and the Stockholder
shall cooperate to, concurrently with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, jointly prepare and file with the SEC a Rule 13e-3 Transaction
Statement on Schedule 13e-3 (such transaction statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the “Schedule 13-e3”) relating to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Stockholder will provide information reasonably requested by the Company or Parent in
connection with the preparation of the Schedule 13e-3. To the Knowledge of the Stockholder, the information supplied by the Stockholder for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13e-3 or any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time that such information is
provided, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and
the Stockholder shall
 
C-8
Table of Contents
cooperate to prepare and file with the SEC one or more disclosure statements on Schedule 13D or amendments or supplements thereto, as applicable
(such disclosure statements, including any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Schedule 13Ds”) relating to the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company will not file the Proxy Statement with the SEC without first providing
the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company will give good faith consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the Stockholder or its counsel. The Company and Parent shall (i) provide the Stockholder and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review drafts of the Schedule 13e-3 prior to filing the Schedule 13e-3 with the SEC and (ii) consider in good faith
all comments thereto reasonably proposed by the Stockholder, its outside counsel and its other Representatives. Parent and the Stockholder shall (i)
provide each other, the Company and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to review drafts of the Schedule 13Ds prior to filing the Schedule
13Ds with the SEC and (ii) consider in good faith all comments thereto reasonably proposed by the other parties, the Company, their outside counsel and
their other Representatives.
(b) Assistance. Parent, Sponsor and the Stockholder will use its reasonable best efforts to furnish all information concerning such
Party and its controlled Affiliates to the other parties that is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule
13e-3, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein and will otherwise reasonably assist
and cooperate with the other in the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13e-3 and the resolution of any comments
to either received from the SEC.

16. Interpretation. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a section or exhibit, such reference shall be to a section of or exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have a corresponding meaning when used as
another part of speech (such as a verb). Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words importing the masculine gender shall
include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa, and the definitions of terms contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as
the plural forms of such terms. The words “includes” or “including” shall mean “including without limitation,” the words “hereof,” “hereby,” “herein,”
“hereunder” and similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular section or article in which such words
appear, the word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean
simply “if,” any reference to a Law shall include any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any reference to any Law in this Agreement shall
mean such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented. Each reference to a “wholly owned Subsidiary” or “wholly owned Subsidiaries”
of a Person shall be deemed to include any Subsidiary of such Person where all of the equity interests of such Subsidiary are directly or indirectly owned
by such Person (other than directors qualifying shares, nominee shares or other equity interests that are required by law or regulation to be held by a
director or nominee).
17. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (along with the documents referenced herein) and the Merger Agreement collectively constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties hereto,
with respect to the subject matter hereof.
18. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
19. Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause or
permit the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. Each of the parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of
the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 15 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 19 will affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of or relates to this Agreement; (iii) irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen
Court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts;
(v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or
 
C-15
Table of Contents
that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any
Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment
in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 19.
20. Assignment; Successors. Other than as provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement (including those set forth in Section 2.1(a)) may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.
21. Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions
that are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, (b) the parties hereto will not assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for such breach and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and without that right, none of the
Company, Parent or the Stockholder would have entered into this Agreement.
22. Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
manager, member, general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any party
hereto or any of their successors or permitted assigns or any direct or indirect director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, general or limited
partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative, successor or permitted assign of any of the foregoing
(each, a “Non-Recourse Party”), shall have any liability to the Stockholder, Parent or the Company for any obligations or liabilities of any party under this
Agreement or for any Legal Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby or in respect of any written or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.
 
C-16
Table of Contents
23. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
24. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one
and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the
other parties hereto, it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
electronic delivery, will be treated in all manners and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto may raise the use of an electronic delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an electronic delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.
25. Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, and the terms and conditions hereof may be waived, only by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a waiver, by an instrument signed on behalf of the party waiving
compliance. No failure or delay on the part of a party in the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall impair such right or power or be construed to
be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right or power.
26. No Presumption Against Drafting Party. The Company, Parent and the Stockholder acknowledge that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any
legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is
expressly waived.
27. Company Special Committee Approval. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be made by the Company or the Company Board without first obtaining the approval of the Company Special Committee. The Company
Special Committee shall direct enforcement by the Company of any provisions of this Agreement against the Stockholder.
28. Expenses. In the event the Merger is consummated, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will bear (a) all the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of legal, financial, tax, accounting, advisory, valuation or other advisors or consultants engaged by or on behalf of Vista Equity Partners
Fund VII, L.P. (“Vista Fund VII”), Vista Equity Partners Fund VIII, L.P. or Parent (including, without limitation, Vista Consulting Group, LLC (“VCG”))
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement (collectively, “Third Party Advisor Fees and
Expenses”), (b) all fees (including commitment fees and original issue discounts), costs and expenses of lenders, investment banks and other debt
financing sources in connection with arranging debt financing (such fees and expenses, together with the Third Party Advisor Fees and Expenses,
collectively, the “Fees and Expenses”) and (c) all reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of legal or tax advisors engaged by or on behalf of the
Stockholder, solely to the extent in connection with the separate representation of the Stockholder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement which Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid only at the Closing or the
consummation of the Exchange, as applicable; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in clause
(c) shall be deemed to override or conflict with the
 
C-17
Table of Contents
terms and provisions of that certain Engagement Letter entered into as of September 28, 2022 by and among the Company, Sjoerd Sjouwerman and
various other parties thereto (the “Engagement Letter”), including the Company’s covenant to pay, or commitment to cause one or more of its affiliates to
pay, the Fees and Expenses (each as defined in the Engagement Letter) in full. In the event that the Merger is not consummated, each party to this
Agreement will bear its own fees and expenses, including fees, expenses and disbursements of legal, financial, tax, accounting, advisory, valuation or
other advisors or consultants.
29. No Agreement until Executed. This Agreement shall not be effective unless and until the Company Board has approved, for purposes of any
applicable anti-takeover laws and regulations, and any applicable provision of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company,
the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
30. No Ownership Interest. Except as expressly provided in Section 2 with respect to the Rollover Shares, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Covered Shares. All ownership and
economic benefits of and relating to the Covered Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder.

D-1Table of Contents
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the Stockholder, the Company and Parent hereby agree as follows:
1. Agreement to Vote the Covered Shares; Proxy.
1.1 Beginning on the date hereof until the Termination Date (as defined below), at every meeting of the Company’s stockholders, including
any postponement, recess or adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstance, however called, the Stockholder agrees to, and if applicable, to cause its
controlled Affiliates to, affirmatively vote (including via proxy) or execute consents with respect to (or cause to be voted (including via proxy) or
consents to be executed with respect to) all of the Owned Shares and any additional shares of Common Stock or other voting securities of the Company
acquired by the Stockholder or its respective controlled Affiliates after the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date (collectively, and together with
the Owned Shares, the “Covered Shares”) as follows: (a) in favor of (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger, including
any amended and restated Merger Agreement or amendment to the Merger Agreement that, in any such case, (x) increases the Per Share Price or (y) other
than amendments covered by clause (x), amendments that otherwise result in the Merger Agreement being more favorable to the Company Stockholders
(solely in their capacity as such) than the Merger Agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement (excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any Adverse
Amendment), (ii) the approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone any Company Stockholder Meeting to a later date if the Company or Parent
proposes or requests such postponement or adjournment in accordance with Section 6.4(b) of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the approval of any other
proposal considered and voted upon by the Company Stockholders at any Company Stockholder Meeting necessary for consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (b) against (i) any proposal, action or agreement that would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement or that would reasonably be expected to result in any condition set forth in the Merger Agreement not being satisfied or not being fulfilled
prior to the Termination Date, (ii) any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, winding up or similar extraordinary
transaction involving the Company (except as contemplated by the Merger Agreement) and (iv) any other action, agreement or proposal which would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement (clauses (a) and (b) collectively, the “Supported Matters”). The Stockholder agrees to, and agrees to cause its applicable
controlled Affiliates to, be present, in person or by proxy, at every meeting of the Company’s stockholders, including any postponement, recess or
adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstance, however called, to vote on the Supported Matters (in the manner described in this Section 1.1) so that
all of the Covered Shares will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at such meeting, or otherwise cause the Covered Shares
to be counted as present threat for purposes of establishing a quorum. For the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect to the Supported Matters, the
Stockholder does not have any obligation to vote the Covered Shares in any particular manner and, with respect to such other matters (other than the
Supported Matters), the Stockholder shall be entitled to vote the Covered Shares in its sole discretion. Except as provided in Section 4.5 of this
Agreement, from and after the date hereof until the Termination Date, the Stockholder shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and the
Company, take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in the conversion of its shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A
Common Stock.
1.2 Proxy. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints, as its proxy and attorney-in-fact, Christina Lema and Gursimarjit Singh, each of
them individually, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote such Stockholder’s Covered Shares in accordance with Section 1.1 at the
Company Stockholder Meeting (including any postponement, recess or adjournment thereof) in respect of such Stockholder’s Covered Shares (to the
extent such Covered Shares are entitled to so vote) prior to the Termination Date at which any Supported Matters are to be considered; provided,
however, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote such Stockholder’s Covered Shares (or to direct how
such Covered Shares shall be
 
D-2
Table of Contents
voted) in such Stockholder’s sole discretion on matters other than Supported Matters. This proxy is coupled with an interest, is (or will be, as applicable)
given as an additional inducement of Parent to enter into this Agreement and shall be irrevocable prior to the Termination Date, at which time any such
proxy shall terminate. Parent may terminate this proxy with respect to such Stockholder at any time at its sole election by written notice provided to such
Stockholder.
2. Rollover.
2.1 Contribution and Exchange. On the terms set forth herein and subject to Section 2.1(c), Section 2.2, Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and Section
2.5:
(a) The Stockholder agrees and covenants to Parent that it will, at the Exchange Time, contribute, assign, transfer, convey and deliver
(or cause to be contributed, assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered) to Topco the Rollover Shares, free and clear of any and all liens (including
any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of the Rollover Shares), except as may exist by reason of this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement and applicable securities laws, in exchange for the issuance by Topco to such Stockholder of, at the Exchange Time, the Exchange Shares (the
“Exchange”).
(b) Each Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Exchange, except as set forth in Section 2.2, such Stockholder
shall have no right, title or interest in or to the Rollover Shares.
(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Stockholder shall be entitled, in its sole discretion but subject to receipt of
all necessary internal approvals (including any relevant LPAC approval), to reduce the number of Rollover Shares that are contributed in the Exchange
pursuant to Section 2 by an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the amount of cash actually funded by the Stockholder to Topco prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter divided by (B) the Per Share Price (rounded down to the nearest whole share); provided, however, that if
the Stockholder does not notify Parent at least 10 Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date of its intent to fund, or cause an Affiliate to fund,
cash under the Equity Commitment Letter and the amount of such funding, the Stockholder shall consummate the Rollover for the maximum Rollover
Amount set forth opposite such Stockholder’s name on Exhibit A.
(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Stockholder may, upon written notice to Parent delivered at least 10
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, distribute all or a portion of the Rollover Shares to its equityholders prior to Closing (solely to the
extent such equityholder (x) is a fund under common control with the Stockholder and (y) has executed prior to such distribution a joinder to this
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent agreeing to be bound by all of the terms hereof applicable to the Stockholder).
2.2 Conditions to Exchange. The obligations of each Stockholder to consummate the Exchange is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by
such Stockholder in writing) of the following conditions:
(a) (i) The satisfaction, or written waiver by Parent, of all conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that are to occur on the Closing Date as set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the
Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver by
Parent (to the extent permitted thereunder) of such conditions), (ii) the contemporaneous funding of the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing at the
Closing and (iii) the contemporaneous consummation of the Merger;
(b) The representations and warranties made by Parent in Section 8.1 through Section 8.6 of this Agreement shall be true and correct

prevent or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the Exchange; and
 
D-3
Table of Contents
(c) No Law enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or issued by any Governmental Authority shall be in effect preventing the
consummation of, or otherwise making illegal, the Exchange.
2.3 Failure to Consummate the Merger. In the event that after the Exchange the Merger fails to be consummated for any reason whatsoever
and the Merger Agreement is terminated, the parties hereto agree that concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement, automatically and
without any action of the parties hereto, Parent shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Stockholders the Rollover Shares and the Stockholders
shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Parent the Exchange Shares issued to the Stockholders. In such event, each party hereto shall, as promptly as
practicable, provide all such cooperation as the other parties hereto may reasonably request in order to ensure that the foregoing has occurred and been
made effective.
2.4 Tax Treatment. Topco, Parent and the Stockholder intend that, for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income tax purposes, (a)
the Exchange, the Sponsor Contributions and the Other Investor Contributions be treated as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code,
pursuant to which the Stockholder, the Sponsors and the Other Investors will receive equity interests of Parent consisting “control,” within the meaning
of Section 368(c) of the Code and (b) the Conversion (as defined below) be treated as a non-taxable recapitalization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
(1)(E) of the Code (the “Intended Tax Treatment”). The Stockholder, the Company and Topco (including Parent on behalf of Topco) shall prepare and file
(and shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of, as reasonably requested) all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and
shall not take any position inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment in connection with any tax matters, in each case, unless otherwise required by a
“determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. The Stockholders shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to designate in writing on
Exhibit B hereto to Parent at any time prior to the Exchange Time specific Owned Shares held by the Stockholder that are intended to treated as Rollover
Shares.
2.5 Structure. References to Parent in the foregoing provisions of this Section 2 shall be deemed to refer to Topco, which receives the
Rollover Shares and in turn contributes them, directly or indirectly, to Parent, as the context requires based on the holding company structure of Parent
and the Sponsors; provided, that, as of the Effective Time, both Parent and Topco shall be treated as domestic corporations for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
2.6 Termination. Parent shall not be permitted terminate its obligations under this Section 2 without the written consent of the Stockholder
and Parent other than in accordance with Sections 4.3(a), Section 4.4 and Section 4.6 herein (it being understood that this Section 2 shall also be
terminated upon any termination of this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 3).
3. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate automatically and without further action upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the valid termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) the Effective Time, (iii) any amendment of the Merger Agreement, without the prior written consent of
Stockholder, that imposes any restriction on Stockholder’s right to receive the Per Share Price (other than immaterial restrictions), reduces the amount of
the Per Share Price or changes the form of the Per Share Price (such amendment, an “Adverse Amendment”) (such date, the “Termination Date”);
provided that the provisions set forth in Sections 15 through 28 shall survive the termination of this Agreement; and provided further that the termination
of this Agreement shall not prevent any party hereto from seeking any remedies (at law or in equity) against any other party hereto for that party’s Willful
Breach of this Agreement that may have occurred on or before such termination. For the purpose hereof, “Willful Breach” means a material breach of this
Agreement that is a consequence of an act or failure to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by or on behalf of the breaching party with the actual
knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a breach of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee (if received) from or on behalf
of the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against the Stockholder or any of its respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holders, general or limited partners, controlling persons, stockholders, members, managers, directors,
 
D-4
Table of Contents
officers, employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) for any breach or failure to perform the Stockholder’
obligations under Section 4.1 hereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate liability of the Stockholder in
connection with any Willful Breach of this Agreement shall not exceed $39,000,000; provided, however that the aggregate liability of the Stockholder
under this Agreement shall be increased to (but shall not exceed) the amount of the Parent Termination Fee that becomes payable to the Company by
Parent, if and only if the Stockholder’s Willful Breach of the Stockholder’s obligations under this Agreement caused the Parent Termination Fee to
become payable by Parent to the Company under the express terms of the Merger Agreement. The Stockholder, such Stockholder’s affiliated fund entities
and its and their respective directors, officers and employees shall be deemed “Representatives” of the Company for purposes of Section 5.4 of the
Merger Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein (including in the preceding sentence) shall in any way limit the Company’s liability
under the Merger Agreement with respect to any breach of the Merger Agreement (including Section 5.4 thereof).
4. Certain Covenants.
4.1 Acquisition Proposals.
(a) From and after the date hereof until the Termination Date, the Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that, except as expressly
contemplated pursuant to this Agreement, the Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its managers, directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents,
attorneys, representatives and advisors (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any offer, inquiry, indication of interest or proposal that constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person or Group (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives in their capacity as such) any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person or Group
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives in their capacity as such) access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any such case in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an
Acquisition Proposal or the making of any offer, inquiry, indication of interest or proposal that constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person or Group with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or with
respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to any offer, indication of interest or proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than
informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 4.1); (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any offer, inquiry, indication of interest or
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract (whether written, oral, binding or non-binding) relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Transaction; or (vi) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.1,
the Stockholder may, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, and furnish information and data to, any Person or Group or their
respective Representatives that have delivered to the Company a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, the Company Board (acting upon
the recommendation of the Company Special Committee) or the Company Special Committee has made a Qualified Acquisition Proposal Determination
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 5.4(b) of the Merger Agreement.
(b) Until the Expiration Time, the Stockholder (solely in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company) shall notify Parent promptly
and, in any event, within 24 hours following any discussion or negotiations with any person in connection with the last sentence of Section 4.1(a). Such
notice must include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal and (B) a summary of the discussions or negotiations, including the
material terms and conditions of any proposal (including with respect to the Stockholder’s potential ownership stake in the Company (or a successor
entity) following such transaction) and,
 
D-5
Table of Contents
if in writing, a copy thereof. Thereafter, the Stockholder must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours), of
the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including by providing a summary of economic terms thereof (including with respect to the
Stockholder’s potential ownership stake in the Company (or a successor entity) following such transaction) and copies of all written materials sent to or
from the Stockholder or any of its Representatives relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder shall not be required to notify Parent
of any discussions or negotiations to the extent the Company has notified Parent thereof.
4.2 Transfers. Beginning on the date hereof until the Termination Date, the Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that, except as
expressly contemplated pursuant to this Agreement, (a) the Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly (i) tender any Covered Shares into any tender or
exchange offer, (ii) offer, sell, transfer, assign, exchange, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, or otherwise dispose of (collectively, “Transfer”) or enter into
any contract, option, agreement, understanding or other arrangement with respect to the Transfer of, any Covered Shares or beneficial ownership, voting
power or any other interest thereof or therein (including by operation of law), (iii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any Covered Shares
into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any Covered Shares that is inconsistent with this Agreement, (iv) take an action that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Merger Agreement or (v) commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions. Any Transfer in violation of this Section 4.2 shall be void ab initio.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Stockholder may Transfer any or all of the Covered Shares, in accordance with applicable
Law, to Stockholder’s Affiliates; provided, that prior to and as a condition to the effectiveness of such Transfer, each Person to whom any of such
Covered Shares or any interest in any of such Covered Shares is or may be transferred shall have executed and delivered to Parent a counterpart of this
Agreement pursuant to which such Person shall be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement. In addition, any Transfer of Covered
Shares shall be permitted from and after the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained under the Merger Agreement so long as, after giving effect to
such Transfer, the Stockholders retain in the aggregate a number of Owned Shares at least equal to the Rollover Shares.
4.3 Regulatory Matters.
(a) Subject to Section 4.4, the Stockholder shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Affiliates to, use their
reasonable best efforts, consistent with the time frames set forth in Section 6.4 of the Merger Agreement, to supply and provide information that, to such
Stockholder’s knowledge, is complete and accurate in all material respects to any Governmental Authority requesting such information in connection
with filings or notifications under, or relating to, applicable laws that are required or advisable as a result of, or pursuant to, the Merger Agreement and
the related financings and transactions, including, without limitation, information required or requested to be provided to any antitrust, financial or
national security regulatory authorities in connection with any approvals reasonably sought in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(collectively, the “Regulatory Filings” and the, “Regulatory Disclosures”, respectively). If any Governmental Authority seeks to prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement based on the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or based on any other
required approval, consent, notice or filing with a Governmental Authority and such actions by the Governmental Authority relate to the activities or
investments of such Stockholder or its Affiliates (solely for purposes of this Section 4, an “Affiliate” of the Stockholder shall include any portfolio
company in which such Stockholder or any of its Affiliates has made a debt or an equity investment), then if Parent in good faith reasonably determines
that such actions by the Governmental Authority will not be resolved sufficiently in advance of the Termination Date, Parent may provide written notice
of that determination to the Stockholder, and Parent may elect to terminate the obligations under Section 2 and Section 4.6 of this Agreement (in which
case the Stockholder’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter shall also automatically terminate) and, in that context, the Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Price under the Merger Agreement with respect to its shares of Common Stock; provided, however that Parent shall not
terminate the Equity Commitment Letter or the obligations under Section 2 of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.3(a) without first obtaining
alternative financing arrangements which
 
D-6
Table of Contents
provide Parent with funds in an amount equal to the Rollover Amount; provided that such alternative financing arrangements (i) provide Parent with
sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the Equity Financing, Debt Financing and other sources of readily available liquidity of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to fund the Required Amount and (ii) do not impose new or additional
conditions to the receipt of such financing relative to the Commitment Letters that could impair or delay the Closing. Parent shall promptly provide the
Company with a copy of any definitive commitment letter or other documentation providing for such alternative financing arrangement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Stockholder may designate any Regulatory Disclosures that contain sensitive, legally privileged, or confidential
information in respect of the Stockholder or any of its Affiliates as exclusive to the Stockholder and the Stockholder may provide that any such sensitive,
legally privileged, or confidential information may only be provided on a counsel-only basis or directly to the applicable Governmental Authority
requesting such information. The Stockholder shall not make any filings, or notifications in connection with the Merger pursuant to any Antitrust Laws
without Parent’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Parent or the Company shall not file any Regulatory
Filings that contain information with respect to the Stockholder or its affiliates without first providing the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and will give good faith consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the
Stockholder and its counsel.
(b) Each Stockholder hereto represent, warrant and covenant to Parent and to the Company that, to such Stockholder’s knowledge:
(i) none of the information supplied in writing by such Stockholder specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Regulatory Disclosures
will contain a material misstatement of fact or a material omission of fact necessary to make the information provided not misleading and (ii) it does not
permit any entity under the “control” (defined in Section 721 of the Defense Production Act, as amended, including all implanting regulations thereof) of
a People’s Republic of China national, or any entity under the control of a Russian Federation national, to obtain through any Affiliate, control with
respect to the Company.  
4.4 Limitations of Regulatory Disclosures. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Stockholder to (i) make available to Parent any of its internal investment committee
materials or analyses or, other than Regulatory Disclosures, any information which the Stockholder considers to be commercially sensitive information or
which is otherwise held subject to an obligation of confidentiality; and (ii) with respect to any Regulatory Disclosures, provide, or cause to be provided
or agree or commit to provide information where the sharing of such information as contemplated would be prohibited by applicable laws applicable to
the Stockholder or its Affiliates or any judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition
applicable to or imposed upon it or its Affiliates. If the Stockholder fails to provide any information referred to in this Section 4.4, and as a result of such
failure, the applicable Governmental Authority denies any regulatory approval or receipt of approval is reasonably expected, in Parent’s good faith
determination after consultation with its Antitrust Law advisors, to be materially delayed, then Parent may elect to terminate the obligations under Section
2 and Section 4.6 of this Agreement (in which case the Stockholder’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter shall also automatically terminate)
and, in that context, the Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Price under Merger Agreement with respect to its shares of Common Stock;
provided, however that Parent shall not terminate the Equity Commitment Letter or the obligations under Section 2 of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 4.4 without first obtaining alternative financing arrangements which provide Parent with funds in an amount equal to the Rollover Amount;
provided that such alternative financing arrangements (i) provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the Equity Financing, Debt
Financing and other sources of readily available liquidity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to
fund the Required Amount and (ii) do not impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of such financing relative to the Commitment Letters that
could impair or delay the Closing. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any definitive commitment letter or other documentation
providing for such alternative financing arrangement.
 
D-7

4.5 Conversion. Not later than eleven (11) days prior to the record date for the stockholder vote to approve the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, Sponsor shall deliver to the Company the notice contemplated by Article V, Section A of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to immediately convert all of their respective shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A
Common Stock. After the date on which Sponsor converts its Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, and in any event not later than ten (10)
days prior to the record date for the stockholder vote to approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder shall deliver
to the Company the notice contemplated by Article V, Section A of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to immediately
convert all of its Rollover Shares (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include all of the Owned Shares set forth opposite such Stockholder’s name on
Exhibit A hereto under the heading “Rollover Shares”, even if the Stockholder has reduced the number of Rollover Shares participating in the Exchange
pursuant to Section 2) from shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Conversion”)
4.6 Consents. Parent agrees that it shall not enter into any amendment to the Merger Agreement that is materially adverse to the
Reinvestment Shareholders, excluding Sponsor (such parties, the “Requisite Shareholders”) without the prior written consent of the Requisite
Shareholders holding 66 % of the Rollover Shares held by all Requisite Shareholders (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, that for purposes of this Section 4.6, “materially adverse” shall be measured with respect to the Requisite Shareholders solely in their
capacities as investors with Parent in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and without regard to their existing ownership stake or
employment or other role in the Company or any consideration they will receive in connection with the Merger; provided, further, that any increase to the
Per Share Price that applies to all Stockholders shall not be considered materially adverse to the Requisite Shareholders and no consent shall be required
under this Section 4.6 for any such increase to the Per Share Price. The Requisite Shareholders shall respond with reasonable promptness to any requests
for consent pursuant to this Section 4.6, including at any time where one or more of the parties hereto has asserted that this Agreement has been
terminated but the validity of such termination is disputed and such dispute has not been resolved by agreement of the parties or a final, non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any Requisite Shareholder engages in discussions or negotiations with any Person or Group with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal, in each case in breach of Section
5.4 of the Merger Agreement, then this Section 4.6 shall immediately terminate and no such consent shall be required. In the event that any Requisite
Shareholder fails to consent to an amendment to the Merger Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.6, the parties hereto agree that Parent may (but is not
required to) terminate this Agreement if it has first obtained alternative financing arrangements which provide Parent with funds in an amount equal to the
Rollover Amount; provided that such alternative financing arrangements (i) provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the
Equity Financing, Debt Financing and other sources of readily available liquidity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on
the Closing Date, to fund the Required Amount and (ii) do not impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of such financing relative to the
Commitment Letters that could impair or delay the Closing. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any definitive commitment letter or
other documentation providing for such alternative financing arrangement.
5. Proxy Statement; Schedule 13e-3 and Schedule 13D.
(a) Promptly (but in no event later than 20 Business Days) after the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company will prepare
(with Parent’s reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders in connection with the Company
Stockholder Meeting (the proxy statement, including any amendments or supplements, the “Proxy Statement”). The Company, Parent and the Stockholder
shall cooperate to, concurrently with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, jointly prepare and file with the SEC a Rule 13e-3 Transaction
Statement on Schedule 13e-3 (such transaction statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the “Schedule 13-e3”) relating to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Stockholder will provide information reasonably requested by the
 
D-8
Table of Contents
Company or Parent in connection with the preparation of the Schedule 13e-3. To the Knowledge of the Stockholder, the information supplied by the
Stockholder for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13e-3 or any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the
time that such information is provided, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Promptly after the execution
of this Agreement, Parent and the Stockholder shall cooperate to prepare and file with the SEC one or more disclosure statements on Schedule 13D or
amendments or supplements thereto, as applicable (such disclosure statements, including any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Schedule 13Ds”)
relating to the Merger Agreement and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company will not file the Proxy
Statement with the SEC without first providing the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the
Company will give good faith consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the Stockholder or its counsel. The Company
and Parent shall (i) provide the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review drafts of the Schedule 13e-3 prior to filing the Schedule
13e-3 with the SEC and (ii) consider in good faith all comments thereto reasonably proposed by the Stockholder, its outside counsel and its other
Representatives. Parent and the Stockholder shall (i) provide each other, the Company and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
drafts of the Schedule 13Ds prior to filing the Schedule 13Ds with the SEC and (ii) consider in good faith all comments thereto reasonably proposed by
the other parties, the Company, their outside counsel and their other Representatives.
(b) Assistance. Parent, Sponsor and the Stockholder will use its reasonable best efforts to furnish all information concerning such
Party and its controlled Affiliates to the other parties that is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule
13e-3, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein and will otherwise reasonably assist
and cooperate with the other in the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13e-3 and the resolution of any comments
to either received from the SEC.

necessary (including approval by the board of directors or applicable corporate bodies) to execute, deliver, comply with and perform its obligations under
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and no other action on the part of or vote
of holders of any equity securities of the Stockholder is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of, compliance with and performance by the
Stockholder of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder and, assuming the due execution and delivery
of this Agreement by all of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Stockholder enforceable against the

and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors’ rights generally.

(i) conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of formation or operating agreement or similar organizational
documents of the Stockholder, (ii) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any applicable Law, (iii) require any consent by any Person under,
constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination,

the properties or assets (including intangible assets) of the Stockholder, except in the

Table of Contents
case of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, any such violation, breach, conflict, default, termination, acceleration, cancellation or loss that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to restrict in any material respect, prohibit or impair in any material respect the consummation of
the Merger or the performance by the Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement.
6.3 Consents. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person, is required by or with respect to the Stockholder in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by
the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby, except (a) as required by the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act, or state securities, takeover and “blue sky” laws, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws, (c) the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC or any applicable stock exchange or (d) as would not, individually or in the

Merger or the performance by the Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement.
6.4 Ownership of the Owned Shares.
(a) The Stockholder is, as of the date hereof, the record and beneficial owner of the Owned Shares, all of which are free and clear of
any liens, other than those created by this Agreement or arising under applicable securities laws or the Investors’ Rights Agreement (as defined herein).
The Stockholder has the full legal right, power and authority to deliver the Rollover Shares to Parent pursuant to Section 2 and to enter into and fulfill all
of its obligations under the Stockholder’s Equity Commitment Letter. The Stockholder does not own, of record or beneficially, any shares of capital stock
of the Company, or other rights to acquire shares of capital stock of the Company, in each case other than the Owned Shares. The Stockholder has the
sole right to dispose of the Owned Shares, and none of the Owned Shares is subject to any pledge, disposition, transfer or other agreement, arrangement
or restriction, except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Investors’ Rights Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Stockholder has not entered
into any agreement to Transfer any Owned Shares and no person has a right to acquire any of the Owned Shares held by the Stockholder.
(b) None of Stockholder or any of its respective directors, officers, general partners or Affiliates or, to the knowledge of Stockholder
or any of its Affiliates, any employees of Stockholders or any of its Affiliates has been an “interested stockholder” (as such term is defined in Article XII
of the Charter) of the Company, in each case during the three years prior to the date of this Agreement or, if Stockholder or any of its respective directors,
officers, general partners or Affiliates does qualify as an “interested stockholder,” then such person was and has continued to be an “interested
stockholder” since prior to April 26, 2021.
6.5 Absence of Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no legal action pending against, or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder,
threatened against the Stockholder that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially or materially impair the ability of the Stockholder to perform
its obligations under this Agreement.
6.6 Investment. The Exchange Shares to be acquired by the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement will be acquired for the Stockholders’
own account and not with a view to, or intention of, distribution thereof in violation of any applicable state securities laws. Each Stockholder is an
“accredited investor” within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D of the SEC. Each Stockholder is sophisticated in financial matters and is able to
evaluate the risks and benefits of the investment in the Exchange Shares. Each Stockholder is able to bear the economic risk of its investment in the
Exchange Shares for an indefinite period of time because the Exchange Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and, therefore, cannot be
sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Each Stockholder has had an
opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of the Exchange Shares and has had access to
such other information concerning Parent as such Stockholder has requested.

16. Interpretation. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a section or exhibit, such reference shall be to a section of or exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have a corresponding meaning when used as
another part of speech (such as a verb). Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words importing the masculine gender shall
include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa, and the definitions of terms contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as
the plural forms of such terms. The words “includes” or “including” shall mean “including without limitation,” the words “hereof,” “hereby,” “herein,”
“hereunder” and similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular section or article in which such words
appear, the word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean
simply “if,” any reference to a Law shall include any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any reference to any Law in this Agreement shall
mean such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented. Each reference to a “wholly owned Subsidiary” or “wholly owned Subsidiaries”
of a Person shall be deemed to include any Subsidiary of such Person where all of the equity interests of such Subsidiary are directly or indirectly owned
by such Person (other than directors qualifying shares, nominee shares or other equity interests that are required by law or regulation to be held by a
director or nominee).
17. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (along with the documents referenced herein) and the Merger Agreement collectively constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties hereto,
with respect to the subject matter hereof.
18. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
19. Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause or
permit the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. Each of the parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of
the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 15 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 19 will affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of or relates to this Agreement; (iii) irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen
Court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts;
(v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or
 
D-15
Table of Contents
that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any
Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment
in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 19.
20. Assignment; Successors. Other than as provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement (including those set forth in Section 2.1(a)) may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.
21. Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions
that are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, (b) the parties hereto will not assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for such breach and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and without that right, none of the
Company, Parent or the Stockholder would have entered into this Agreement.
22. Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
manager, member, general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any party
hereto or any of their successors or permitted assigns or any direct or indirect director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, general or limited
partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative, successor or permitted assign of any of the foregoing
(each, a “Non-Recourse Party”), shall have any liability to the Stockholder, Parent or the Company for any obligations or liabilities of any party under this
Agreement or for any Legal Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby or in respect of any written or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.
 
D-16
Table of Contents
23. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
24. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one
and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the
other parties hereto, it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
electronic delivery, will be treated in all manners and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto may raise the use of an electronic delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an electronic delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.
25. Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, and the terms and conditions hereof may be waived, only by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a waiver, by an instrument signed on behalf of the party waiving
compliance. No failure or delay on the part of a party in the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall impair such right or power or be construed to
be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right or power.
26. No Presumption Against Drafting Party. The Company, Parent and the Stockholder acknowledge that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any
legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is
expressly waived.
27. Company Special Committee Approval. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be made by the Company or the Company Board without first obtaining the approval of the Company Special Committee. The Company
Special Committee shall direct enforcement by the Company of any provisions of this Agreement against the Stockholder.
28. Expenses. In the event the Merger is consummated, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will bear (a) all the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of legal, financial, tax, accounting, advisory, valuation or other advisors or consultants engaged by or on behalf of Vista Equity Partners
Fund VII, L.P. (“Vista Fund VII”), Vista Equity Partners Fund VIII, L.P. or Parent (including, without limitation, Vista Consulting Group, LLC (“VCG”))
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement (collectively, “Third Party Advisor Fees and
Expenses”), (b) all fees (including commitment fees and original issue discounts), costs and expenses of lenders, investment banks and other debt
financing sources in connection with arranging debt financing (such fees and expenses, together with the Third Party Advisor Fees and Expenses,
collectively, the “Fees and Expenses”) and (c) all reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of legal or tax advisors engaged by or on behalf of the
Stockholder, solely to the extent in connection with the separate representation of the Stockholder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement which Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid only at the Closing upon the funding
of the Stockholder’s Commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter or the consummation of the Exchange, as applicable. In the event that the Merger
is not consummated, each party to
 
D-17
Table of Contents
this Agreement will bear its own fees and expenses, including fees, expenses and disbursements of legal, financial, tax, accounting, advisory, valuation or
other advisors or consultants.
29. No Agreement until Executed. This Agreement shall not be effective unless and until the Company Board has approved, for purposes of any
applicable anti-takeover laws and regulations, and any applicable provision of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company,
the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
30. No Ownership Interest. Except as expressly provided in Section 2 with respect to the Rollover Shares, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Covered Shares. All ownership and
economic benefits of and relating to the Covered Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the Stockholder, the Company and Parent hereby agree as follows:
1. Agreement to Vote the Covered Shares; Proxy.
1.1 Beginning on the date hereof until the Termination Date (as defined below), at every meeting of the Company’s stockholders, including
any postponement, recess or adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstance, however called, the Stockholder agrees to, and if applicable, to cause its
controlled Affiliates to, affirmatively vote (including via proxy) or execute consents with respect to (or cause to be voted (including via proxy) or
consents to be executed with respect to) all of the Owned Shares and any additional shares of Common Stock or other voting securities of the Company
acquired by the Stockholder or its respective controlled Affiliates after the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date (collectively, and together with
the Owned Shares, the “Covered Shares”) as follows: (a) in favor of (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger, including
any amended and restated Merger Agreement or amendment to the Merger Agreement that, in any such case, (x) increases the Per Share Price or (y) other
than amendments covered by clause (x), amendments that otherwise result in the Merger Agreement being more favorable to the Company Stockholders
(solely in their capacity as such) than the Merger Agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement (excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any Adverse
Amendment), (ii) the approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone any Company Stockholder Meeting to a later date if the Company or Parent
proposes or requests such postponement or adjournment in accordance with Section 6.4(b) of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the approval of any other
proposal considered and voted upon by the Company Stockholders at any Company Stockholder Meeting necessary for consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (b) against (i) any proposal, action or agreement that would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement or that would reasonably be expected to result in any condition set forth in the Merger Agreement not being satisfied or not being fulfilled
prior to the Termination Date, (ii) any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, winding up or similar extraordinary
transaction involving the Company (except as contemplated by the Merger Agreement) and (iv) any other action, agreement or proposal which would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement (clauses (a) and (b) collectively, the “Supported Matters”). The Stockholder agrees to, and agrees to cause its applicable
controlled Affiliates to, be present, in person or by proxy, at every meeting of the Company’s stockholders, including any postponement, recess or
adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstance, however called, to vote on the Supported Matters (in the manner described in this Section 1.1) so that
all of the Covered Shares will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at such meeting, or otherwise cause the Covered Shares
to be counted as present threat for purposes of establishing a quorum. For the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect to the Supported Matters, the
Stockholder does not have any obligation to vote the Covered Shares in any particular manner and, with respect to such other matters (other than the
Supported Matters), the Stockholder shall be entitled to vote the Covered Shares in its sole discretion. Except as provided in Section 4.5 of this
Agreement, from and after the date hereof until the Termination Date, the Stockholder shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and the
Company, take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in the conversion of its shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A
Common Stock.
1.2 Proxy. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints, as its proxy and attorney-in-fact, Christina Lema and Gursimarjit Singh, each of
them individually, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote such Stockholder’s Covered Shares in accordance with Section 1.1 at the
Company Stockholder Meeting (including any postponement, recess or adjournment thereof) in respect of such Stockholder’s Covered Shares (to the
extent such Covered Shares are entitled to so vote) prior to the Termination Date at which any Supported Matters are to be considered; provided,
however, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote such Stockholder’s Covered Shares (or to direct how
such Covered Shares shall be
 
E-2

voted) in such Stockholder’s sole discretion on matters other than Supported Matters. This proxy is coupled with an interest, is (or will be, as applicable)
given as an additional inducement of Parent to enter into this Agreement and shall be irrevocable prior to the Termination Date, at which time any such
proxy shall terminate. Parent may terminate this proxy with respect to such Stockholder at any time at its sole election by written notice provided to such
Stockholder.
2. Rollover.
2.1 Contribution and Exchange. On the terms set forth herein and subject to Section 2.2, Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and Section 2.5:

(or cause to be contributed, assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered) to Topco the Rollover Shares, free and clear of any and all liens (including
any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of the Rollover Shares), except as may exist by reason of this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement and applicable securities laws, in exchange for the issuance by Topco to such Stockholder of, at the Exchange Time, the Exchange Shares (the
“Exchange”).
(b) Each Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Exchange, except as set forth in Section 2.2, such Stockholder

extent such equityholder (x) is a fund under common control with the Stockholder and (y) has executed prior to such distribution a joinder to this
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent agreeing to be bound by all of the terms hereof applicable to the Stockholder).
2.2 Conditions to Exchange. The obligations of each Stockholder to consummate the Exchange is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by
such Stockholder in writing) of the following conditions:

Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that are to occur on the Closing Date as set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the
Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver by
Parent (to the extent permitted thereunder) of such conditions), (ii) the contemporaneous funding of the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing at the
Closing and (iii) the contemporaneous consummation of the Merger;
(b) The representations and warranties made by Parent in Section 8.1 through Section 8.6 of this Agreement shall be true and correct

(c) No Law enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or issued by any Governmental Authority shall be in effect preventing the
consummation of, or otherwise making illegal, the Exchange.

without any action of the parties hereto, Parent shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Stockholders the Rollover Shares and the Stockholders
shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Parent the Exchange Shares issued to the Stockholders. In such event, each party hereto shall, as promptly as

2.4 Tax Treatment. Topco, Parent and the Stockholder intend that, for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income tax purposes, (a)
the Exchange, the Sponsor Contributions and the Other Investor Contributions be treated as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code,
pursuant to which the Stockholder, the Sponsors and the Other Investors will receive equity interests of Parent consisting “control,” within the meaning
of Section 368(c) of the Code and (b) the Conversion (as defined below) be treated as a non-taxable recapitalization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
(1)(E) of the Code (the “Intended Tax Treatment”). The Stockholder, the Company and Topco (including Parent on behalf of Topco) shall prepare and file
(and shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of, as reasonably requested) all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and
shall not take any position inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment in connection with any tax matters, in each case, unless otherwise required by a
“determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. The Stockholders shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to designate in writing on
Exhibit B hereto to Parent at any time prior to the Exchange Time specific Owned Shares held by the Stockholder that are intended to treated as Rollover
Shares.
2.5 Structure. References to Parent in the foregoing provisions of this Section 2 shall be deemed to refer to Topco, which receives the
Rollover Shares and in turn contributes them, directly or indirectly, to Parent, as the context requires based on the holding company structure of Parent
and the Sponsors; provided, that, as of the Effective Time, both Parent and Topco shall be treated as domestic corporations for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
2.6 Termination. Parent shall not be permitted terminate its obligations under this Section 2 without the written consent of the Stockholder
and Parent other than in accordance with Sections 4.3(a), Section 4.4 and Section 4.6 herein (it being understood that this Section 2 shall also be
terminated upon any termination of this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 3).
3. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate automatically and without further action upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the valid termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) the Effective Time, (iii) any amendment of the Merger Agreement, without the prior written consent of
Stockholder, that imposes any restriction on Stockholder’s right to receive the Per Share Price (other than immaterial restrictions), reduces the amount of
the Per Share Price or changes the form of the Per Share Price (such amendment, an “Adverse Amendment”) (such date, the “Termination Date”);
provided that the provisions set forth in Sections 15 through 28 shall survive the termination of this Agreement; and provided further that the termination
of this Agreement shall not prevent any party hereto from seeking any remedies (at law or in equity) against any other party hereto for that party’s Willful
Breach of this Agreement that may have occurred on or before such termination. For the purpose hereof, “Willful Breach” means a material breach of this
Agreement that is a consequence of an act or failure to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by or on behalf of the breaching party with the actual
knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a breach of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee (if received) from or on behalf
of the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against the Stockholder or any of its respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holders, general or limited partners, controlling persons, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or assignees
(excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) for any breach or failure to perform the Stockholder’ obligations under Section 4.1 hereof. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate liability of the Stockholder in connection with any Willful Breach of this
Agreement shall not exceed $55,000,000; provided, however that the aggregate liability of the Stockholder under this Agreement shall be increased to (but
shall not exceed) the amount of the Parent Termination Fee that becomes payable to the Company by Parent, if and only if the Stockholder’s Willful
Breach of the Stockholder’s obligations under this Agreement caused the Parent Termination Fee to become payable by Parent to the Company under the
express terms of the Merger Agreement. The Stockholder, such Stockholder’s affiliated fund entities and its and their respective directors, officers and
employees shall be deemed “Representatives” of the Company for purposes of Section 5.4 of the Merger Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing herein (including in the preceding sentence) shall in any way limit the Company’s liability

under the Merger Agreement with respect to any breach of the Merger Agreement (including Section 5.4 thereof).
4. Certain Covenants.

proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract (whether written, oral, binding or non-binding) relating to an Acquisition

the Stockholder may, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, and furnish information and data to, any Person or Group or their
respective Representatives that have delivered to the Company a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, the Company Board (acting upon

(b) Until the Expiration Time, the Stockholder (solely in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company) shall notify Parent promptly
and, in any event, within 24 hours following any discussion or negotiations with any person in connection with the last sentence of Section 4.1(a). Such

(and in any event within 24 hours), of the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including by providing a summary of economic terms thereof
(including with respect to the Stockholder’s potential ownership stake in the Company (or a successor entity) following such transaction) and copies of

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Stockholder may Transfer any or all of the Covered Shares, in accordance with applicable
Law, to Stockholder’s Affiliates; provided, that prior to and as a condition to the effectiveness of such Transfer, each Person to whom any of such
Covered Shares or any interest in any of such Covered Shares is or may be transferred shall have executed and delivered to Parent a counterpart of this
Agreement pursuant to which such Person shall be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement. In addition, any Transfer of Covered
Shares shall be permitted from and after the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained under the Merger Agreement so long as, after giving effect to
such Transfer, the Stockholders retain in the aggregate a number of Owned Shares at least equal to the Rollover Shares.
4.3 Regulatory Matters.
(a) Subject to Section 4.4, the Stockholder shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Affiliates to, use their
reasonable best efforts, consistent with the time frames set forth in Section 6.4 of the Merger Agreement, to supply and provide information that, to such
Stockholder’s knowledge, is complete and accurate in all material respects to any Governmental Authority requesting such information in connection
with filings or notifications under, or relating to, applicable laws that are required or advisable as a result of, or pursuant to, the Merger Agreement and
the related financings and transactions, including, without limitation, information required or requested to be provided to any antitrust, financial or
national security regulatory authorities in connection with any approvals reasonably sought in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(collectively, the “Regulatory Filings” and the, “Regulatory Disclosures”, respectively). If any Governmental Authority seeks to prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement based on the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or based on any other
required approval, consent, notice or filing with a Governmental Authority and such actions by the Governmental Authority relate to the activities or
investments of such Stockholder or its Affiliates (solely for purposes of this Section 4, an “Affiliate” of the Stockholder shall include any portfolio
company in which such Stockholder or any of its Affiliates has made a debt or an equity investment), then if Parent in good faith reasonably determines
that such actions by the Governmental Authority will not be resolved sufficiently in advance of the Termination Date, Parent may provide written notice
of that determination to the Stockholder, and Parent may elect to terminate the obligations under Section 2 and Section 4.6 of this Agreement (in which
case the Stockholder’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter shall also automatically terminate) and, in that context, the Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Price under the Merger Agreement with respect to its shares of Common Stock; provided, however that Parent shall not
terminate the Equity Commitment Letter or the obligations under Section 2 of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.3(a) without first obtaining
alternative financing arrangements which provide Parent with funds in an amount equal to the Rollover Amount; provided that such alternative financing
arrangements (i) provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the Equity Financing, Debt Financing and other sources of readily
available liquidity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to fund the Required Amount and (ii) do not
impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of such financing relative to the Commitment Letters that could impair or delay the Closing. Parent
shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any definitive commitment letter or other documentation providing for such alternative financing
arrangement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Stockholder may designate any Regulatory Disclosures that contain sensitive, legally
privileged, or confidential information in respect of the Stockholder or any of its Affiliates as exclusive to the Stockholder and the Stockholder may
provide that any such sensitive, legally privileged, or confidential information may only be provided on a counsel-only basis or directly to the applicable
Governmental Authority
 
E-6
Table of Contents
requesting such information. The Stockholder shall not make any filings, or notifications in connection with the Merger pursuant to any Antitrust Laws
without Parent’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Parent or the Company shall not file any Regulatory
Filings that contain information with respect to the Stockholder or its affiliates without first providing the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and will give good faith consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the
Stockholder and its counsel.
(b) Each Stockholder hereto represent, warrant and covenant to Parent and to the Company that, to such Stockholder’s knowledge:
(i) none of the information supplied in writing by such Stockholder specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Regulatory Disclosures
will contain a material misstatement of fact or a material omission of fact necessary to make the information provided not misleading and (ii) it does not
permit any entity under the “control” (defined in Section 721 of the Defense Production Act, as amended, including all implanting regulations thereof) of
a People’s Republic of China national, or any entity under the control of a Russian Federation national, to obtain through any Affiliate, control with
respect to the Company.  
4.4 Limitations of Regulatory Disclosures. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Stockholder to (i) make available to Parent any of its internal investment committee
materials or analyses or, other than Regulatory Disclosures, any information which the Stockholder considers to be commercially sensitive information or
which is otherwise held subject to an obligation of confidentiality; and (ii) with respect to any Regulatory Disclosures, provide, or cause to be provided
or agree or commit to provide information where the sharing of such information as contemplated would be prohibited by applicable laws applicable to
the Stockholder or its Affiliates or any judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition
applicable to or imposed upon it or its Affiliates. If the Stockholder fails to provide any information referred to in this Section 4.4, and as a result of such
failure, the applicable Governmental Authority denies any regulatory approval or receipt of approval is reasonably expected, in Parent’s good faith
determination after consultation with its Antitrust Law advisors, to be materially delayed, then Parent may elect to terminate the obligations under Section
2 and Section 4.6 of this Agreement (in which case the Stockholder’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter shall also automatically terminate)
and, in that context, the Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Price under Merger Agreement with respect to its shares of Common Stock;
provided, however that Parent shall not terminate the Equity Commitment Letter or the obligations under Section 2 of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 4.4 without first obtaining alternative financing arrangements which provide Parent with funds in an amount equal to the Rollover Amount;
provided that such alternative financing arrangements (i) provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the Equity Financing, Debt
Financing and other sources of readily available liquidity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to
fund the Required Amount and (ii) do not impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of such financing relative to the Commitment Letters that
could impair or delay the Closing. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any definitive commitment letter or other documentation
providing for such alternative financing arrangement.
4.5 Conversion. Not later than eleven (11) days prior to the record date for the stockholder vote to approve the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, Sponsor shall deliver to the Company the notice contemplated by Article V, Section A of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to immediately convert all of their respective shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A
Common Stock. After the date on which Sponsor converts its Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, and in any event not later than ten (10)
days prior to the record date for the stockholder vote to approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder shall deliver
to the Company the notice contemplated by Article V, Section A of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to immediately
convert all of its Rollover Shares from shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Conversion”)
4.6 Consents. Parent agrees that it shall not enter into any amendment to the Merger Agreement that is materially adverse to the
Reinvestment Shareholders, excluding Sponsor (such parties, the “Requisite 
 
E-7
Table of Contents
Shareholders”) without the prior written consent of the Requisite Shareholders holding 66 % of the Rollover Shares held by all Requisite Shareholders
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, that for purposes of this Section 4.6, “materially adverse” shall be
measured with respect to the Requisite Shareholders solely in their capacities as investors with Parent in the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and without regard to their existing ownership stake or employment or other role in the Company or any consideration they will receive in
connection with the Merger; provided, further, that any increase to the Per Share Price that applies to all Stockholders shall not be considered materially
adverse to the Requisite Shareholders and no consent shall be required under this Section 4.6 for any such increase to the Per Share Price. The Requisite
Shareholders shall respond with reasonable promptness to any requests for consent pursuant to this Section 4.6, including at any time where one or more
of the parties hereto has asserted that this Agreement has been terminated but the validity of such termination is disputed and such dispute has not been
resolved by agreement of the parties or a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any Requisite Shareholder engages in
discussions or negotiations with any Person or Group with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating
to a potential Acquisition Proposal, in each case in breach of Section 5.4 of the Merger Agreement, then this Section 4.6 shall immediately terminate and
no such consent shall be required. In the event that any Requisite Shareholder fails to consent to an amendment to the Merger Agreement pursuant to
this Section 4.6, the parties hereto agree that Parent may (but is not required to) terminate this Agreement if it has first obtained alternative financing
arrangements which provide Parent with funds in an amount equal to the Rollover Amount; provided that such alternative financing arrangements (i)
provide Parent with sufficient funds, when added to the proceeds of the Equity Financing, Debt Financing and other sources of readily available liquidity
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to fund the Required Amount and (ii) do not impose new or
additional conditions to the receipt of such financing relative to the Commitment Letters that could impair or delay the Closing. Parent shall promptly
provide the Company with a copy of any definitive commitment letter or other documentation providing for such alternative financing arrangement.
5. Proxy Statement; Schedule 13e-3 and Schedule 13D.
(a) Promptly (but in no event later than 20 Business Days) after the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company will prepare
(with Parent’s reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders in connection with the Company
Stockholder Meeting (the proxy statement, including any amendments or supplements, the “Proxy Statement”). The Company, Parent and the Stockholder
shall cooperate to, concurrently with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, jointly prepare and file with the SEC a Rule 13e-3 Transaction

transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Stockholder will provide information reasonably requested by the Company or Parent in
connection with the preparation of the Schedule 13e-3. To the Knowledge of the Stockholder, the information supplied by the Stockholder for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13e-3 or any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time that such information is
provided, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and
the Stockholder shall cooperate to prepare and file with the SEC one or more disclosure statements on Schedule 13D or amendments or supplements
thereto, as applicable (such disclosure statements, including any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Schedule 13Ds”) relating to the Merger
Agreement and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company will not file the Proxy Statement with the SEC
without first providing the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company will give good faith
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the Stockholder or its counsel. The Company and Parent shall (i) provide
the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review drafts of the Schedule 13e-3 prior to filing the Schedule 13e-3 with the SEC and (ii)
consider in good faith all comments thereto reasonably proposed by the Stockholder, its outside counsel and its other Representatives. Parent and the

Party and its controlled Affiliates to the other parties that is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule
13e-3, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein and will otherwise reasonably assist
and cooperate with the other in the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13e-3 and the resolution of any comments

6. Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder. The Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent and the Company as follows:
6.1 Due Authority. The Stockholder is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of formation. Each of the Stockholder has all requisite corporate or other similar power and authority and has taken all corporate or other similar action
necessary (including approval by the board of directors or applicable corporate bodies) to execute, deliver, comply with and perform its obligations under
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and no other action on the part of or vote
of holders of any equity securities of the Stockholder is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of, compliance with and performance by the
Stockholder of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder and, assuming the due execution and delivery
of this Agreement by all of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Stockholder enforceable against the
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors’ rights generally.
6.2 No Conflict. The execution and delivery of, compliance with and performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder do not and will not
(i) conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of formation or operating agreement or similar organizational
documents of the Stockholder, (ii) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any applicable Law, (iii) require any consent by any Person under,
constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Stockholder is entitled, under any Contract binding upon the
Stockholder, or to which any of its properties, rights or other assets are subject or (iv) result in the creation of a lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of
the properties or assets (including intangible assets) of the Stockholder, except in the case of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, any such violation,
breach, conflict, default, termination, acceleration, cancellation or loss that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to restrict
in any material respect, prohibit or impair in any material respect the consummation of the Merger or the performance by the Stockholder of its obligations
under this Agreement.
6.3 Consents. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person, is required by or with respect to the Stockholder in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by
the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby, except (a) as required by the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act, or state securities, takeover and “blue sky” laws, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws, (c) the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC or any applicable stock exchange or (d) as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to restrict in any material respect, prohibit, impair in any material respect or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger or the performance by the Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement.

6.4 Ownership of the Owned Shares.
(a) The Stockholder is, as of the date hereof, the record and beneficial owner of the Owned Shares, all of which are free and clear of
any liens, other than those created by this Agreement or arising under applicable securities laws or the Investors’ Rights Agreement (as defined herein).
The Stockholder has the full legal right, power and authority to deliver the Rollover Shares to Parent pursuant to Section 2. The Stockholder does not
own, of record or beneficially, any shares of capital stock of the Company, or other rights to acquire shares of capital stock of the Company, in each case
other than the Owned Shares. The Stockholder has the sole right to dispose of the Owned Shares, and none of the Owned Shares is subject to any
pledge, disposition, transfer or other agreement, arrangement or restriction, except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Investors’ Rights
Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Stockholder has not entered into any agreement to Transfer any Owned Shares and no person has a right to
acquire any of the Owned Shares held by the Stockholder.
(b) None of Stockholder or any of its respective directors, officers, general partners or Affiliates or, to the knowledge of Stockholder
or any of its Affiliates, any employees of Stockholders or any of its Affiliates has been an “interested stockholder” (as such term is defined in Article XII
of the Charter) of the Company, in each case during the three years prior to the date of this Agreement or, if Stockholder or any of its respective directors,
officers, general partners or Affiliates does qualify as an “interested stockholder,” then such person was and has continued to be an “interested
stockholder” since prior to April 26, 2021.
6.5 Absence of Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no legal action pending against, or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder,
threatened against the Stockholder that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially or materially impair the ability of the Stockholder to perform
its obligations under this Agreement.
6.6 Investment. The Exchange Shares to be acquired by the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement will be acquired for the Stockholders’
own account and not with a view to, or intention of, distribution thereof in violation of any applicable state securities laws. Each Stockholder is an
“accredited investor” within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D of the SEC. Each Stockholder is sophisticated in financial matters and is able to
evaluate the risks and benefits of the investment in the Exchange Shares. Each Stockholder is able to bear the economic risk of its investment in the
Exchange Shares for an indefinite period of time because the Exchange Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and, therefore, cannot be
sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Each Stockholder has had an
opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of the Exchange Shares and has had access to
such other information concerning Parent as such Stockholder has requested.
6.7 Finders Fees. No broker, investment bank, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s, financial adviser’s or
similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of such Stockholder.
7. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Stockholder and Parent as follows:
7.1 Due Authority. The Company is a legal entity duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of formation. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary (including approval by the
Company Board (acting on the recommendation of the Company Special Committee)) to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement
in accordance with the terms hereof and no other corporate action by the Company or vote of holders of any class of the capital stock of the Company is
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
execution and delivery of this Agreement by all of the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company

of its Subsidiaries, or to which any of their respective properties, rights or other assets are subject or (iv) result in the creation of a lien (other than
Permitted Liens) on any of the properties or assets (including intangible assets) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of clauses

directors or applicable corporate bodies) to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and no
other corporate action by Parent or vote of holders of any class of the capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement by all of the other parties
hereto, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors’ rights generally.
8.2 No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement do not and will not, other than as provided in the
Merger Agreement with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, (i) conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any

properties or assets (including intangible assets) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, any such

of the transactions contemplated hereby, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably

8.4 Absence of Litigation As of the date hereof, there is no legal action pending against, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against

this Agreement.
8.5 Exchange Shares. The Exchange Shares, when issued to the Stockholders pursuant to the Exchange, will be duly authorized, validly
issued and outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable, and issued free and clear of any liens, other than those created by Governance Documents or

director or officer of the Company or any of the Company’s subsidiaries to take, or refrain from taking, any action in his or her capacity as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its affiliates, including the exercise of fiduciary duties to the Company or its stockholders, and any such action taken in
such capacity or any such inaction shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.

Section 262 of the DGCL or otherwise with respect to the Owned Shares with respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.
12. Other Agreements. Acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Company Special Committee and the approval of the Company Board,
the Company hereby irrevocably waives, and shall not enforce, the obligations of the Stockholder and its Affiliates pursuant to Section 2.13 of the
Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement dated as of July 2, 2019 by and among the Company and those investors party thereto (as amended,
the “Investors’ Rights Agreement”) with respect to any actions taken by the Stockholder and/or their Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Exchange (and all other transactions incidental and related
thereto) and the exercise of any rights pursuant to this Agreement.

16. Interpretation. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a section or exhibit, such reference shall be to a section of or exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. If a term is defined as one part of
 
E-14
Table of Contents
speech (such as a noun), it shall have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a verb). Unless the context of this
Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa, and the
definitions of terms contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. The words “includes” or
“including” shall mean “including without limitation,” the words “hereof,” “hereby,” “herein,” “hereunder” and similar terms in this Agreement shall refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular section or article in which such words appear, the word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean simply “if,” any reference to a Law shall include any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and any reference to any Law in this Agreement shall mean such Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented. Each reference to a “wholly owned Subsidiary” or “wholly owned Subsidiaries” of a Person shall be deemed to include any Subsidiary of
such Person where all of the equity interests of such Subsidiary are directly or indirectly owned by such Person (other than directors qualifying shares,
nominee shares or other equity interests that are required by law or regulation to be held by a director or nominee).
17. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (along with the documents referenced herein) and the Merger Agreement collectively constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties hereto,
with respect to the subject matter hereof.
18. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
19. Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause or
permit the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. Each of the parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of
the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 15 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 19 will affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of or relates to this Agreement; (iii) irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen
Court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts;
(v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal
Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any Legal
Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO
 
E-15
Table of Contents
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 19.
20. Assignment; Successors. Other than as provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement (including those set forth in Section 2.1(a)) may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.
21. Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions
that are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, (b) the parties hereto will not assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for such breach and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and without that right, none of the
Company, Parent or the Stockholder would have entered into this Agreement.
22. Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
manager, member, general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any party
hereto or any of their successors or permitted assigns or any direct or indirect director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, general or limited
partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative, successor or permitted assign of any of the foregoing
(each, a “Non-Recourse Party”), shall have any liability to the Stockholder, Parent or the Company for any obligations or liabilities of any party under this
Agreement or for any Legal Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby or in respect of any written or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.
23. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
24. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one
and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the
other parties hereto, it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent
 
E-16
Table of Contents
delivered by electronic delivery, will be treated in all manners and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto may raise the use of an electronic delivery to
deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an electronic delivery,
as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.
25. Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, and the terms and conditions hereof may be waived, only by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a waiver, by an instrument signed on behalf of the party waiving
compliance. No failure or delay on the part of a party in the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall impair such right or power or be construed to
be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right or power.
26. No Presumption Against Drafting Party. The Company, Parent and the Stockholder acknowledge that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any
legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is
expressly waived.
27. Company Special Committee Approval. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be made by the Company or the Company Board without first obtaining the approval of the Company Special Committee. The Company
Special Committee shall direct enforcement by the Company of any provisions of this Agreement against the Stockholder.
28. Expenses. In the event the Merger is consummated, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will bear (a) all the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of legal, financial, tax, accounting, advisory, valuation or other advisors or consultants engaged by or on behalf of Vista Equity Partners
Fund VII, L.P. (“Vista Fund VII”), Vista Equity Partners Fund VIII, L.P. or Parent (including, without limitation, Vista Consulting Group, LLC (“VCG”))
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement (collectively, “Third Party Advisor Fees and
Expenses”), (b) all fees (including commitment fees and original issue discounts), costs and expenses of lenders, investment banks and other debt
financing sources in connection with arranging debt financing (such fees and expenses, together with the Third Party Advisor Fees and Expenses,
collectively, the “Fees and Expenses”) and (c) all reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of legal or tax advisors engaged by or on behalf of the
Stockholder, solely to the extent in connection with the separate representation of the Stockholder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement which Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid only at the Closing or the
consummation of the Exchange. In the event that the Merger is not consummated, each party to this Agreement will bear its own fees and expenses,
including fees, expenses and disbursements of legal, financial, tax, accounting, advisory, valuation or other advisors or consultants.
29. No Agreement until Executed. This Agreement shall not be effective unless and until the Company Board has approved, for purposes of any
applicable anti-takeover laws and regulations, and any applicable provision of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company,
the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
30. No Ownership Interest. Except as expressly provided in Section 2 with respect to the Rollover Shares, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Covered Shares. All ownership and
economic benefits of and relating to the Covered Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder.

be expected to result in any condition set forth in the Merger Agreement not being satisfied or not being fulfilled prior to the Termination Date, (ii) any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, winding up or similar extraordinary transaction involving the Company (except as

of establishing a quorum. For the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect to the Supported Matters, the Stockholder does not have any obligation to
vote the Covered Shares in any particular manner and, with respect to such other matters (other than the Supported Matters), the Stockholder shall be
entitled to vote the Covered Shares in its sole discretion.
1.2 Proxy. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints as its proxy and attorney-in-fact Gerhard Watzinger, Kevin Klausmeyer and Krish

14. Interpretation. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a section or exhibit, such reference shall be to a section of or exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have a corresponding meaning when used as
another part of speech (such as a verb). Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words importing the masculine gender shall
include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa, and the definitions of terms contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as
the plural forms of such terms. The words “includes” or “including” shall mean “including without limitation,” the words “hereof,” “hereby,” “herein,”
“hereunder” and similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular section or article in which such words
appear, the word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean
simply “if,” any reference to a Law shall include any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any reference to any Law in this Agreement shall
mean such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented. Each reference to a “wholly owned Subsidiary” or “wholly owned Subsidiaries”
of a Person shall be deemed to include any Subsidiary of such Person where all of the equity interests of such Subsidiary are directly or indirectly owned
by such Person (other than directors qualifying shares, nominee shares or other equity interests that are required by law or regulation to be held by a
director or nominee).
15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (along with the documents referenced herein) and the Merger Agreement collectively constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties hereto,
with respect to the subject matter hereof.
16. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
17. Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause or
permit the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. Each of the parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of
the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 15 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 17 will affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of or relates to this Agreement; (iii) irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen
Court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts;
(v) waives any
 
F-7
Table of Contents
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought
in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts
will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
(WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 17.
18. Assignment; Successors. Other than as provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
19. Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions
that are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, (b) the parties hereto will not assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for such breach and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and without that right, none of the
Company, Parent or the Stockholder would have entered into this Agreement.
20. Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
manager, member, general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any party
hereto or any of their successors or permitted assigns or any direct or indirect director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, general or limited
partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative, successor or permitted assign of any of the foregoing
(each, a “Non-Recourse Party”), shall have any liability to the Stockholder or the Company for any obligations or liabilities of any party under this
Agreement or for any Legal Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby or in respect of any written or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.

21. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
22. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one
and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the
other parties hereto, it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
electronic delivery, will be treated in all manners and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto may raise the use of an electronic delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an electronic delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.
23. Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, and the terms and conditions hereof may be waived, only by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a waiver, by an instrument signed on behalf of the party waiving
compliance. No failure or delay on the part of a party in the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall impair such right or power or be construed to
be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right or power.
24. No Presumption Against Drafting Party. The Company and the Stockholder acknowledge that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any
legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is
expressly waived.
25. Company Special Committee Approval. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be made by the Company or the Company Board without first obtaining the approval of the Company Special Committee. The Company
Special Committee shall direct enforcement by the Company of any provisions of this Agreement against the Stockholder.
26. No Agreement until Executed. This Agreement shall not be effective unless and until the Company Board has approved, for purposes of any
applicable anti-takeover laws and regulations, and any applicable provision of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company,
the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.
