neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing and properly and
validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (which shares of our
common stock we refer to collectively as the “excluded shares”)) will be cancelled and automatically converted into
the right to receive $34.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. We refer to this amount
as the “per share price.”
At or prior to the closing of the merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment
agent to pay the aggregate per share price. Once our stockholders have provided the payment agent with any
documentation required by the payment agent, the payment agent will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of
the aggregate per share price in exchange for the shares of our common stock held by that stockholder. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Payment Agent, Exchange
Fund, and Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share price for each share of our common
stock that you own, but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder (except that our stockholders who
properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do not validly withdraw or otherwise lose, their appraisal rights will
have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal
proceeding as contemplated by the DGCL, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The

found on your proxy card or voting instruction form in order to participate in the special meeting (including voting

on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at
the time of the special meeting.

special meeting. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum.

common stock using the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. Under applicable stock
exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters, but not on non-

brokers and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important
that you cast your vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
If you hold your shares of our common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other

time of the merger will be treated in the following manner in connection with the merger. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Conversion of Shares-Equity Awards; ESPP.”
Treatment of Medallia Equity-Based Awards
•
Restricted stock units (including performance-based restricted stock units) (which we refer to as “Medallia
equity-based awards”) that are vested as of the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as “vested
Medallia equity-based awards”) will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total number of shares of our
common stock then-subject to such Medallia equity-based award. This amount (less any required
withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of
the merger.
•
Medallia equity-based awards that are unvested as of the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as
“unvested Medallia equity-based awards”) will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total number of shares of
our common stock then-subject to such unvested Medallia equity-based award. Subject to the holder’s
continued service with Parent and its representatives through the applicable vesting dates, these unvested
cash amounts will vest and be payable (less any required withholding and other taxes) pursuant to the
corresponding unvested Medallia equity-based award’s vesting schedule. For unvested Medallia equity-
based awards that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions that remain unsatisfied as of the
effective time of the merger, the performance metrics of such awards will be deemed achieved at a specified
level of achievement, and the corresponding cash amount will vest and be paid out in lump sum at the end
of the original award’s performance period, subject to the holder’s continued service.
Treatment of Medallia Options
•
Stock options (which we refer to as “Medallia options”) that are vested as of the effective time of the
merger (which we refer to as “vested Medallia options”) will be cancelled and converted into a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share
price less the exercise price per share of such option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock
then issuable upon exercise in full of such vested Medallia option. This amount (less any required
withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of
the merger.
•
Stock options that are unvested as of the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as “unvested
Medallia options”) will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per share
of such option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon exercise in full of
such unvested Medallia option. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its
representatives through the applicable vesting dates, these unvested cash amounts will vest and be
payable (less any required withholding and other taxes) pursuant to the corresponding unvested Medallia
option’s vesting schedule.
Treatment of the ESPP

for compensation or employee benefits (which we refer to as “Medallia benefit plans”) in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, except that the surviving corporation is permitted to
amend or terminate Medallia benefit plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by applicable law.
As of the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation or one of its subsidiaries will continue to employ all
of our employees and all of the employees of our subsidiaries. We refer to each individual who is our employee or an
employee of any of our subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and continues to be an
employee of Parent or one of its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) immediately following the effective
time of the merger as a “continuing employee.”
During the one-year period following the effective time of the merger, base compensation and target annual or
shorter-term cash incentive compensation opportunities will not be decreased for any continuing employee. In
addition, during the one-year period following the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will provide
to continuing employees severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided by Medallia and its
subsidiaries as of the date of the merger agreement.
For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger (or until an earlier termination of employment for a
particular continuing employee), the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries generally will:
•
maintain for the benefit of continuing employees the Medallia benefit plans (other than the opportunity to
participate in equity-based incentive compensation, defined benefit pension, retiree or post-employment
welfare or nonqualified deferred compensation (which we refer to as “excluded benefits”)) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect on the date of the merger agreement;
•
provide other compensation and benefits (other than excluded benefits) to each continuing employee that,
taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than the
excluded benefits) provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time (which we
refer to as “comparable plans”); or
•
provide some combination of Medallia benefit plans and comparable plans such that each continuing
employee receives compensation and benefits (other than excluded benefits) that, taken as a whole, are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than excluded benefits)
provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time.
Continuing employees generally will be granted service credit for service with us and our subsidiaries prior to the
effective time of the merger, and with Parent, the surviving corporation and any of their subsidiaries on or after the
effective time of the merger, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting in 401(k) or similar retirement benefits
and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement but not for purposes of a defined benefit pension plan or equity or equity-based compensation or benefit
plan).
Generally speaking, following the effective time of the merger:
•
continuing employees will be allowed to participate immediately in any new compensation or benefit
arrangements that replace Medallia benefit plans to the same extent as such continuing employees were
eligible under the replaced Medallia benefit plans;
•
all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or similar requirements will be waived to the same extent they
were waived under the replaced Medallia benefit plans;
6TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
any eligible expenses paid by a continuing employee and his or her covered dependents under a Medallia
benefit plan will be given credit with respect to any new benefit arrangement that replaces the applicable
Medallia benefit plan for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, co-payment, coinsurance,
offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements for the applicable plan year;
•
continuing employees will be credited for any unused balances in flexible spending accounts; and
•
continuing employees will receive credit for any accrued but unused vacation or paid time off as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

and outstanding rights to purchase shares or our common stock under the ESPP, as described in more detail
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Medallia’s Directors and

based awards and Medallia options, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger-Interests of Medallia’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of

•
The entitlement of each of our executive officers to receive payments and benefits pursuant to Medallia’s

beginning three months before our change in control through 12 months after our change in control,
Medallia terminates their employment with Medallia for a reason other than “cause,” death or “disability”
or they resign for “good reason,” in each case as set forth in the Severance Policy. These payments and
benefits include:
○
a lump sum payment equal to 12 months’ base salary (18 months for Leslie Stretch, our president
and chief executive officer);
○
a lump sum equal to a pro-rata target annual bonus for the year of termination plus 100 percent of
the executive’s target annual bonus for the year of termination (150 percent for Mr. Stretch);
○
payment of COBRA continuation coverage premiums for up to 12 months (18 months for Mr.
Stretch), or taxable payments in lieu of such payment; and
○
100 percent acceleration of unvested time-based equity awards; and payment of COBRA
continuation coverage premiums for up to 12 months (18 months for Mr. Stretch) or taxable

statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that these
stockholders will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive
payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate
of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded
quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes
a voluntary cash payment to stockholders seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1)
the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under
no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the
appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration
that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Only a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of
record must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Medallia before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3)
continue to hold the subject shares of our common stock of record through the effective time of the merger; and (4)
strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly
the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Medallia unless certain conditions are satisfied by the
stockholders seeking appraisal, as described further below. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for
exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its
entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, a copy of which is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for
such U.S. Holder’s shares of our common stock in the merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in
an amount measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the
merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of our common stock surrendered in the merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the
exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the
United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain
certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger.” Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences

(1) initiate, solicit, propose, induce or encourage any alternative acquisition proposals from third parties; (2) provide

9TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the terms of the merger agreement, from the no-shop period start date until the effective time of the merger (or
the earlier termination of the merger agreement), Medallia has agreed that it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries
and their respective directors and executive officers not to, and it will not authorize or permit any of its or its
subsidiaries’ employees, consultants or other representatives to, directly or indirectly (other than with respect to an
excluded party):
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage,
facilitate or assist, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal;
•
furnish to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees) any non-public
information relating to Medallia or any of its subsidiaries or afford to any person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective designees) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Medallia or any of its subsidiaries, in any such case in
connection with any acquisition proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an acquisition proposal or the making of
any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any person with respect to an acquisition
proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third persons relating to the making of an acquisition
proposal;
•
approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal;
•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
other contract relating to an acquisition transaction, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement (we
refer to any of these as an “alternative acquisition agreement”); or
•
authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.
However, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders, Medallia and the Medallia Board (or a
committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their representatives (including its financial
advisor), (1) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; (2) furnish any non-public information relating
to Medallia or any of its subsidiaries to; (3) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other
non-public information or to any personnel, of Medallia or any of its subsidiaries to; or (4) otherwise facilitate the
making of a superior proposal by, in each case, (a) any excluded party or its representatives or (b) any person or its
representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to Medallia a written acquisition proposal after the no-shop
period start date that was not solicited in breach of the applicable restrictions. Medallia may do this only if the
Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that (1) such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely
to lead to a superior proposal; and (2) the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Solicitation of Other Acquisition Offers.”
Medallia is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal unless it
complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with Parent
during a specified period. If Medallia terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal from a
third party it must pay a termination fee to Parent. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement

"Medallia, Inc._20210914_DEFM14A_19531748_4294624.Pdf",Termination Fees and Remedies,"Termination Fees and Remedies
The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for Medallia and Parent. Upon valid termination of the
merger agreement under specified circumstances, Medallia will be required to pay Parent (or its designee) a
termination fee of $191,110,000. Specifically, this termination fee will be payable by Medallia to Parent if the merger
agreement is terminated:
•
by Parent, if the Medallia Board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger;
•
by Parent, if Medallia breaches or fails to perform, in accordance with the merger agreement, in any material
respects, its obligations under the alternative solicitation provisions in the merger agreement; or
•
by Medallia, if the Medallia Board authorizes the acceptance of a superior proposal.
The termination fee will also be payable in certain circumstances if:
•
the merger agreement is terminated (1) because the merger is not completed by the termination date; (2)
because of Medallia’s failure to obtain the required approval of our stockholders; or (3) subject to a 45-day
cure period, because Medallia breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to not be satisfied;
•
prior to such termination (but after the date of the merger agreement) a proposal, generally speaking, to
acquire at least 50 percent of Medallia’s stock or assets is publicly announced or publicly disclosed by a
third party and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and
•
Medallia subsequently consummates, or enters into a definitive agreement providing for, a transaction
involving the acquisition of at least 50 percent of its stock or assets within one year of such termination.
Notwithstanding the above, under certain circumstances as described in the merger agreement, if Medallia terminates
the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal with a specified party, then the amount of the termination fee
payable to Parent will be $95,550,000.
Upon termination of the merger agreement under other specified circumstances, Parent will be required to pay
Medallia a termination fee of $382,220,000, the payment of which has been guaranteed pursuant to and subject to the
terms and conditions of the limited guaranty. Specifically, the termination fee will be payable by Parent to Medallia if
the merger agreement is terminated:
•
subject to a 45-day cure period, by Medallia, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the
related closing conditions to not be satisfied; or
•
by Medallia, if Parent failed to consummate the merger as required pursuant to, and in the circumstances
specified in, the merger agreement.
In certain instances, Parent can elect to delay the closing of the merger to November 1, 2021. If Parent does so and
does not close the merger on or before November 1, 2021, then the termination fee payable by Parent will be
$445,920,000.
The merger agreement also provides that Medallia, on one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may
specifically enforce the obligations under the merger agreement, except that Medallia may only cause Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the merger, and the Thoma Bravo Fund to provide equity financing pursuant to the
equity commitment letter, if certain conditions are satisfied, including the funding or availability of the debt financing.
Neither Parent nor Medallia is required to pay to the other its termination fee on more than one occasion.

Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The action seeks, among other things, to (1) enjoin defendants from
consummating the merger unless and until defendants disseminate revised disclosures; (2) rescind the merger or

Information.”
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On July 26, 2021, we announced that Medallia entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement,
Parent will acquire Medallia for $34.00 in cash per share of our common stock. In order to complete the merger,
our stockholders representing a majority of all issued and outstanding common stock must vote to adopt the
merger agreement at the special meeting. This approval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the
Merger.” The Medallia Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares
of our common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the special
meeting.
This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the
merger agreement, the special meeting and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed
materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock without attending the special
meeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.
Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy
as soon as possible.
Q:
What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Medallia?
A:
The proposed merger is the acquisition of Medallia by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is
approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Medallia, with Medallia continuing as the surviving corporation.
As a result of the merger, Medallia will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and our common stock will
no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
Q:
What will I receive if the merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $34.00 in cash, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own, unless you have properly
exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the DGCL, and certain
other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of our common stock, you will
receive $3,400.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
How does the per share price compare to the market price of Medallia’s common stock?
A:
This amount constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 20 percent to the closing price of our common stock on
June 10, 2021, which was the last full trading day before public speculation that Medallia was pursuing a sale;
and (2) a premium of approximately 29 percent to Medallia’s unaffected 30-day price average.
15TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What will happen to Medallia equity-based awards and Medallia options?
A:
Generally speaking, Medallia equity-based awards and Medallia options will be treated as follows:
•
Vested Medallia equity-based awards will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total number of shares of
our common stock then-subject to such Medallia equity-based award. This amount (less any required
withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of
the merger.
•
Unvested Medallia equity-based awards will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total number of shares of
our common stock then-subject to such unvested Medallia equity-based award. Subject to the holder’s
continued service with Parent and its representatives through the applicable vesting dates, these unvested
cash amounts will vest and be payable (less any required withholding and other taxes) pursuant to the
corresponding unvested Medallia equity-based award’s vesting schedule. For unvested Medallia equity-
based awards that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions that remain unsatisfied as of the
effective time of the merger, the performance metrics of such awards will be deemed achieved at a specified
level of achievement, and the corresponding cash amount will vest and be paid out in lump sum at the end
of the original award’s performance period, subject to the holder’s continued service.
•
Vested Medallia options will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per share
of such option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon exercise in full of
such vested Medallia option. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to
the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the merger.
•
Unvested Medallia options will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price
per share of such option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon exercise in
full of such unvested Medallia option. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its
representatives through the applicable vesting dates, these unvested cash amounts will vest and be
payable (less any required withholding and other taxes) pursuant to the corresponding unvested Medallia
option’s vesting schedule.
Q:
What will happen to the ESPP?
A:
Generally speaking, the ESPP will be treated as follows:
•
From and after the date of the merger agreement, (1) no further offering period or purchase period will
commence pursuant to the ESPP; and (2) no participant may increase his or her rate of payroll deductions
under the ESPP.
•
Any offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be in progress as of the
effective time of the merger will be terminated no later than one business day prior to the date on which the
effective time of the merger occurs.
•
No later than one business day prior to the effective time of the merger, we will apply any funds within each
ESPP participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares of our common stock in accordance with the
terms of the ESPP. These shares will be deposited into the applicable participant’s account and will treated
in the same manner as any other outstanding share of common stock in connection with the consummation
of the merger. Any amounts not used for the purchase of shares of our common stock will be refunded.
Q:

16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the
special meeting.
Q:
When and where is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will take place on Thursday, October 14, 2021, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific time. You may attend the
special meeting via a live interactive webcast on the internet at
http://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MDLA2021SM. You will be able to listen to the special meeting live
and vote online. You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting instruction form in order
to participate in the special meeting (including voting your shares).
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
All of our stockholders as of the close of business on September 1, 2021, which is the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to vote their shares of our common stock at the special meeting. As of the close of business
on the record date, there were 161,157,197 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
special meeting. Each share of our common stock outstanding as of the record date is entitled to one vote per
share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of the record
date is required to adopt the merger agreement.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or
by telephone; or (3) vote at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or
other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation
that will or may become payable by Medallia to its named executive officers in connection with the merger; and
(2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting?
A:
Approval of the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or
by telephone; or (3) vote at the special meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger, or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time
of the special meeting, except to the extent that such failure affects obtaining a quorum at the meeting. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your
shares will not have any effect on these proposals, except to the extent that such failure affects obtaining a
quorum at the meeting. In all cases, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these
proposals.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we
refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger affects you. Then, even if you
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
expect to attend the special meeting, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy
card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience), or grant your proxy electronically over the
internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at
the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction form
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee for information on how to vote your shares. Please do not send
your stock certificates with your proxy card.
Q:
How does the Medallia Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Medallia Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement;
(2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other
reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock. Instead: (1)
Medallia will remain an independent public company; (2) our common stock will continue to be listed and traded
on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with the
SEC.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Medallia has agreed to pay Parent (or
its designee) a termination fee. In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Parent
has agreed to pay Medallia a reverse termination fee, the payment of which has been guaranteed by the
guarantors.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Termination
Fees and Remedies.”
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to its named executive officers in
connection with the merger?
A:
The compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection
with the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of
Medallia’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and arrangements that are contractual in
nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Parent or its affiliates (including, following the
consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation) to our named executive officers in connection with or
following the merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 2: Approval, on a Non-Binding, Advisory Basis, of Certain Merger-Related
Executive Compensation.”
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to
our named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
Medallia is required to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may
become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of the
compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger is not required to consummate the merger.
Q:
What will happen if Medallia’s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable
by Medallia to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger is not a condition to consummation of the merger. This is an advisory vote and will
not be binding on Medallia or Parent. The underlying plans and arrangements providing for such compensation
are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the merger is consummated, the
compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger will or may be paid to Medallia’s named executive officers even if our stockholders do not approve
such compensation.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” If you are a
stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf
of Medallia. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares at the special
meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of our common stock held in “street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock
held in “street name,” this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee
who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you
have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their
instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the
stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy”
from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instruction, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of obtaining a quorum or voted on the proposals,
which will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no
effect on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection with the merger or the adjournment proposal,
except to the extent affecting the obtaining of a quorum at the meeting.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your
convenience);
•
by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
•
by calling the toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the
enclosed proxy card.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your
shares of our common stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when
voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although there is no charge for voting your shares, if
you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access and
telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of our common
stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you
beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of our common stock at the special meeting even if you have
previously voted by proxy. If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote will
revoke any previously submitted proxy.
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically
over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other
nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or
nominee. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special
meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote
your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
May I attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting?
A:
Yes. You may attend the special meeting via a live interactive webcast on the internet at
http://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MDLA2021SM. You will be able to listen to the special meeting live
and vote online. The special meeting will begin at 8:00 a.m., Pacific time, on Thursday, October 14, 2021. Online
check-in will begin a few minutes prior to the special meeting. You will need the control number found on your
proxy card or voting instruction form in order to participate in the special meeting (including voting your
shares). As the special meeting is virtual, there will be no physical meeting location.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special
meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is
provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the
instructions found on the proxy card). If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your
vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
If, as of the record date, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” you may not vote your
shares at the special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving
you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting. Otherwise, you should instruct your bank, broker or
other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be
considered at the special meeting without your instructions. Without your instructions, your shares will not be
counted for purposes of a quorum or voted at the meeting, which will have the same effect as voting against the
adoption of the merger agreement.
Q:
Why did Medallia choose to hold a virtual special meeting?
A:
The Medallia Board decided to hold the special meeting virtually in response to public health concerns over
large gatherings of people and in order to help limit potential transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, our
experience with virtual meetings demonstrated that the goals of accessibility and stockholder participation can
be well served by the virtual format.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of our common
stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is
called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock is
called a “proxy card.” You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to designate a proxy by telephone or by
the Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card. Leslie Stretch and
Roxanne Oulman, each with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy holders for the special
meeting.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the special meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
•
attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed
proxy card.
If you hold your shares of our common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the special meeting if you
obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the
special meeting.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will
vote your shares in the way that you direct.
If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the Medallia
Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or
dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal
containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the
appropriate cash payment for the shares of our common stock represented by your stock certificates. Unless
you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the
cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you
hold your shares of our common stock in book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of transmittal. Instead the
payment agent will pay you the appropriate portion of the merger consideration upon receipt of a customary
“agent’s message” and any other items specified by the payment agent.
Q:
What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special
meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected effective
date of the merger. If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the
special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the
person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies Medallia in writing of such special
arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share price with respect to such shares, if the merger
is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those
shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record
date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided
for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the
instructions found on the proxy card).
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy
card and voting instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than
one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder
of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
Please vote all voting materials that you receive.
21
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
If available, Medallia may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. Medallia
intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the
special meeting. All reports that Medallia files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See the section of
this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the
merger?
A:
If you are a U.S. Holder, the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of our
common stock surrendered in the merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with
respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain
connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder
complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup
withholding tax.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine
the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances
and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign
taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and does not constitute legal advice
to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is
provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect to complete the merger in 2021. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at
all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger
agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q:
What governmental and regulatory approvals are required?
A:
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to
the merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated. Additionally, under the terms of the merger
agreement, the merger cannot be completed until affirmative approval or clearance required under the Austrian
Cartel Act has been obtained.
The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on September 7, 2021. The waiting
period under the Austrian Cartel Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Central European time, on September 6, 2021.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) continuously hold their shares of our common stock through the effective time of the merger; (3)
properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements as
described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to
appraisal, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the
DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court
of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares, exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the
22
TABLE OF CONTENTS
merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount
rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of
the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before
the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each
stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery;
and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation
to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal
of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights
due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are
described in additional detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262
of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.
Q:
Do any of Medallia’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Medallia
stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Medallia Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that
are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. In: (1) evaluating and negotiating
the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3) unanimously recommending
that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Medallia Board was aware of and considered
these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Medallia’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger.”
Q:

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",25,34
"Medallia, Inc._20210914_DEFM14A_19531748_4294624.Pdf",FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral
statements or other written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking
statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts, including, without limitation, statements
relating to the completion of the merger. You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-
looking words, such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“continue,” “potential,” “plan,” “forecast” and other words of similar import. Our stockholders are cautioned that any
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve significant risks and
uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risks
and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including in our most
recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement, and the following factors:
•
the inability to complete the merger due to the failure of our stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or
the failure to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the merger, including that a governmental
entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant a necessary regulatory approval;
•
the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay a termination
fee;
•
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the merger
agreement;
•
risks that the merger affects our current operations or our ability to retain or recruit employees;
•
the fact that receipt of the all-cash per share price will be taxable to our stockholders that are treated as U.S.
Holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that, if the merger is completed, our stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential
long-term value of the successful execution of Medallia’s current strategy as an independent company;
•
the possibility that Medallia could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including
restructuring efforts, special dividends or the sale of some or all of Medallia’s assets to one or more as yet
unknown purchasers, that could conceivably produce a higher aggregate value than that available to our
stockholders in the merger;
•
the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Medallia is restrained at certain times from soliciting
other acquisition proposals during the pendency of the merger;
•
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on our business relationships, customers,
operating results and business generally, including risks related to the diversion of the attention of
Medallia management or employees during the pendency of the merger;
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger agreement or the merger;
•
the risk that the proposed merger will not be consummated in a timely manner, exceeding the expected costs
of the merger;
•
the risk that our stock price may fluctuate during the pendency of the merger and may decline significantly
if the merger is not completed; and
•
risks related to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval to the merger.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the
information contained or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, including: (1) the information contained
under this caption; and (2) information in our most recent filings on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, including the
information contained under the caption “Risk Factors,” and information in our consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary
materially from the forward-looking statements.
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our stockholders are advised to consult any
future disclosures that we make on related subjects as may be detailed in our other filings made from time to time with
the SEC.

special meeting. A list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available at our

Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the issued and shares of our common stock outstanding as of the record date. Adoption of the merger agreement by
our stockholders is a condition to the closing of the merger.
25TABLE OF CONTENTS
Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power
of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to
vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted: (1)
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers
in connection with the merger; and (3) “AGAINST” any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special
meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not
vote on a proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks
discretionary power to vote your shares. We do not expect any “broker non-votes” at the special meeting, but if there
are any, they will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If there are broker non-
votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will
have no effect on: (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; or (2) the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the

We currently expect to complete the merger in 2021. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all,
cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many
of which are outside of our control.
Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement;
(2) continuously hold their shares through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their
shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not
withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in
connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to
seek appraisal of their shares by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of
their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal
Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any
time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to
each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and
(2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make
such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process,
stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with
respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
28TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration
that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Only a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of
record must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Medallia before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3)
continue to hold the subject shares of our common stock of record through the effective time of the merger; and (4)
strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly
the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Medallia unless certain conditions are satisfied by the
stockholders seeking appraisal. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are
described in further detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the
DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, a copy of which is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish

procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.

Parent was formed on July 22, 2021, solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and has not engaged in any business activities other than as incidental to its formation and in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and arranging of the equity financing and
any debt financing in connection with the merger.
Project Metal Merger Sub, Inc.
c/o Thoma Bravo, L.P.
600 Montgomery Street, 20th Floor
San Francisco, California 91444
(415) 263-3660
Merger Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and was formed on July 22, 2021, solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Merger Sub has not engaged in any business
activities other than as incidental to its formation and in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and arranging of the equity financing and any debt financing in connection with the merger. Upon
completion of the merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and Medallia will continue as the surviving corporation.
Effect of the Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
effective time of the merger, (1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Medallia; (2) the separate existence of Merger
Sub will cease; and (3) Medallia will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.
As a result of the merger, Medallia will cease to be a publicly traded company, our common stock will be delisted from
the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act and Medallia will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If
the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.
30TABLE OF CONTENTS
The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that
certificate by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as we, Parent and Merger Sub may
agree and specify in such certificate of merger).
Effect on Medallia if the Merger is Not Completed
If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,
our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger.
Instead, (1) Medallia will remain an independent public company; (2) our common stock will continue to be listed and
traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with the
SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that: (1) our management will continue to operate the
business as it is currently being operated; and (2) our stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and
opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which
Medallia operates and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the merger not to be
completed, the price of our common stock may decline significantly.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the effect of the merger not being completed on the future value of your
shares of our common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Medallia Board will continue to evaluate and review,
among other things, Medallia’s business, operations, strategic direction and capitalization, and will make whatever
changes it deems appropriate. If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not
completed for any other reason, Medallia’s business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely impacted.
In specified circumstances in which the transaction is terminated, Medallia has agreed to pay Parent (or its designee)
the applicable termination fee.
Per Share Price
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger:
•
each share of our common stock that is (1) held by Medallia as treasury stock; (2) owned by Parent or
Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor;
•
each share of our common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger (other than the shares identified in the prior bullet and shares of our common stock held by
our stockholders who have (1) neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement nor
consented thereto in writing; and (2) properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in
respect of such shares in accordance with the DGCL) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the per share price; and
•
each certificate formerly representing any shares of our common stock or any book-entry shares that
represented shares of our common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
automatically be cancelled and retired and all such shares will cease to exist and will thereafter only
represent the right to receive the per share price.
At or prior to the closing of the merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment
agent to pay the aggregate per share price. Once a stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its
stock certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of a stock certificate) or customary agent’s message with respect to
book-entry shares, appropriate letter of transmittal and other items specified by the payment agent, then the payment
agent will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of the aggregate per share price. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange
and Payment Procedures.”
After the merger is completed, each of our stockholders will have the right to receive the per share price for each
share of our common stock that such stockholder owned, as described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement-Conversion of Shares,” but will no longer have any rights as a Medallia

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement.
This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Medallia Board, the Strategic
Committee (as defined below), our representatives, and other parties. Other than as described below and for
contacts in the ordinary course of our business, there have been no material contacts between Medallia and Thoma
Bravo in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.
The Medallia Board regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward
strengthening our business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Medallia Board has,
from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the
continuation of, and potential improvements to, our current business plan, with Medallia remaining an independent
entity; (2) the investment in, and development of, new products and services; (3) capital raising activities; (4)
potential expansion opportunities through acquisitions, partnerships or other commercial relationships; and (5)
business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of Medallia.
Since completing its initial public offering in July 2019, Medallia’s stock price has exhibited significant volatility. This
volatility was often associated with investor concerns related to (1) the nature of Medallia’s operating results, which
reflect quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in Medallia’s bookings; and (2) Medallia’s ability to grow at a consistent rate.
Given our customer concentration in the hospitality sector, Medallia’s business was also significantly impacted
during the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On April 7, 2021, a representative of a financial acquirer (which we refer to as “Financial A”) contacted Leslie Stretch,
our president and chief executive officer, regarding Financial A’s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of
Medallia. Financial A did not propose specific terms of an acquisition at this time. Mr. Stretch was familiar with
Financial A, but had not previously discussed an acquisition of Medallia with Financial A.
On April 11, 2021, a representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Stretch regarding Thoma Bravo’s interest in
exploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Thoma Bravo did not propose specific terms of an acquisition at this
time. Mr. Stretch was familiar with Thoma Bravo, but had not previously discussed an acquisition of Medallia with
Thoma Bravo.
On April 13, 2021, Mr. Stretch and the representative of Thoma Bravo spoke about Medallia generally and Thoma
Bravo’s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Mr. Stretch informed this representative that he
would discuss Thoma Bravo’s interest with the Medallia Board.
Also on April 13, 2021, Mr. Stretch and representatives of Financial A spoke about Medallia generally and Financial
A’s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Mr. Stretch informed these representatives that he would
discuss Financial A’s interest with the Medallia Board.
Following these discussions with Thoma Bravo and Financial A, Mr. Stretch spoke with members of the Medallia
Board and informed them of the communications from, and discussions with, Thoma Bravo and Financial A. In
addition, prior to the meeting of the Medallia Board on May 5, 2021, that is described below, Mr. Stretch regularly
spoke with the members of the Medallia Board regarding these and subsequent communications.
On April 19, 2021, Mr. Stretch and the representative of Thoma Bravo spoke again about Thoma Bravo’s interest in
exploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Mr. Stretch again informed this representative that he would discuss
Thoma Bravo’s interest with the Medallia Board.
On April 23, 2021, Mr. Stretch and Roxanne Oulman, our executive vice president and chief financial officer, spoke
with representatives of Morgan Stanley about the communications from Financial A and Thoma Bravo. During this
conversation, the parties also discussed, in general terms, (1) the nature of the strategic alternatives that could be
available to Medallia should it elect to pursue a strategic review process; (2) the broad outlines of a process that
Medallia might engage in to evaluate its strategic alternatives; (3) and the possibility
32TABLE OF CONTENTS
that Morgan Stanley could serve as our financial advisor in connection with a review of strategic alternatives.
Morgan Stanley is well known to Medallia and Medallia management given Morgan Stanley’s qualifications,
extensive expertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which Medallia operates and experience in
advising software companies in connection with potential strategic transactions.
On May 3, 2021, a representative of a financial acquirer (which we refer to as “Financial B”) contacted Mr. Stretch
regarding Financial B’s interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Medallia. Mr. Stretch was familiar with Financial
B, but had not previously discussed an acquisition of Medallia with Financial B.
On May 5, 2021, Mr. Stretch updated the Medallia Board about the communications from, and discussions with,
Thoma Bravo, Financial A and Financial B. Mr. Stretch expressed his view that it would be appropriate to better
understand the nature of each firm’s interest in an acquisition of Medallia. It was the consensus of the Medallia
Board to allow Mr. Stretch to share limited diligence information with Thoma Bravo, Financial A and Financial B.
On May 7, 2021, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to discuss Medallia and its
business. During this meeting, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman provided their preliminary views on our financial and

Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, outside counsel to Medallia (which we refer to as “Wilson
Sonsini”). Those present discussed the acquisition interest expressed by Financial A, Thoma Bravo and Financial B.
On May 11, 2021, Mr. Stretch and a representative of Financial B spoke about Medallia generally and Financial B’s

operating results for our fiscal first quarter.
On May 20, 2021, Mr. Stretch and a representative of Thoma Bravo spoke about Thoma Bravo’s continued interest in
acquiring Medallia. After this discussion, Thoma Bravo submitted a preliminary, nonbinding written indication of
interest to acquire Medallia in an all-cash transaction for $30.00 per share of our common stock.
Later on May 20, 2021, the Medallia Board met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the
members of the Medallia Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the major
strategic alternatives available to Medallia, including (1) the continuation of our current business plan with Medallia
remaining as an independent company; and (2) a sale of Medallia. As part of this discussion, the representatives of
Morgan Stanley provided Morgan Stanley’s preliminary view as to the most likely potential strategic and financial
acquirers of Medallia based on (1) Morgan Stanley’s judgment and experience; (2) the strategic fit of Medallia with
each potential acquirer; and (3) the ability and likelihood of each potential acquirer to engage in, and consummate, an
acquisition of Medallia. After considering our near- and long-term prospects as an independent company, as well as
(1) the terms of the preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest from Thoma Bravo and (2) the acquisition
interest expressed by Financial A and Financial B, the Medallia Board was of the view that a sale of Medallia in the
near term could be in the best interests of Medallia and our stockholders. As a result, the Medallia Board determined
to commence a process to explore our strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of Medallia. To assist in the
review of strategic alternatives, the Medallia Board established a strategic committee (which we refer to as the
“Strategic Committee”). The Strategic
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Committee was formed in light of (1) the potentially significant workload that could be involved in evaluating
strategic alternatives; (2) the possibility that Medallia management may need feedback and direction on relatively
short notice; and (3) the benefits and convenience of having a subset of directors oversee and direct the process of
considering strategic alternatives. The Medallia Board authorized and instructed the Strategic Committee, among
other things, to (1) oversee and provide assistance to Medallia management and our advisers with respect to the
exploration, evaluation, consideration, review and negotiation of the terms and conditions of any strategic
alternative, including any sale of Medallia; (2) take such other actions with respect to any strategic alternative as the
Strategic Committee deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable; and (3) recommend to the Medallia Board what
action, if any, should be taken by Medallia with respect to any such transaction. The Medallia Board retained the
power and authority to approve the final decision on pursuing a strategic alternative, including a sale of Medallia. It
was also understood that the Medallia Board would continue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic
alternatives. The Medallia Board appointed Robert Bernshtyn, Mitchell K. Dauerman and Douglas M. Leone as the
members of the Strategic Committee. The Medallia Board did not provide for the payment of any compensation to the
members of the Strategic Committee in consideration of their service on the committee. Finally, the Medallia Board
authorized the retention of a financial adviser to assist us with a review of strategic alternatives, and delegated
authority to the Strategic Committee to select and retain this financial advisor.
Also on May 20, 2021, Mr. Stretch spoke with a representative of Financial B to discuss Medallia and its business.
On May 21, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed potential
strategic and financial acquirers that, in Morgan Stanley’s view, were the most likely to have an interest in an
acquisition of Medallia based on (1) Morgan Stanley’s judgment and experience; (2) the strategic fit of Medallia with
each potential acquirer; and (3) the ability and likelihood of each potential acquirer to engage in, and consummate, an
acquisition of Medallia. The Strategic Committee determined to undertake the exploration of strategic alternatives
through a targeted, private process focused on the strategic and financial buyers identified by Morgan Stanley (and
agreed to by the Strategic Committee) as the most likely to have an interest in acquiring Medallia. The Strategic
Committee believed that a targeted, private process had the greatest potential to minimize the risk of unwanted public
disclosure and speculation that Medallia was pursuing a sale. The Strategic Committee further believed that any
public disclosure and speculation concerning our future would be harmful to our business and competitive position,
as well as to our relationships with our employees, customers and prospects. The Strategic Committee was informed
that Financial B wished to work cooperatively with another financial acquirer (which we refer to as “Financial C”)
and one of Financial B’s portfolio companies (which we refer to as “PortfolioCo”) in connection with considering an
acquisition of Medallia. We refer to these three potential acquirers collectively as the “Consortium Group.” Medallia
and PortfolioCo have a go-to-market relationship. The Strategic Committee determined to allow this cooperation due
to, among other things, the potential synergy value associated with a combination of Medallia and PortfolioCo and
the possibility that either or both of Financial B or Financial C would not pursue an acquisition on their own. The
Strategic Committee also reviewed the terms of, and approved our entry into, an engagement letter with Morgan
Stanley. The Strategic Committee selected Morgan Stanley in view of Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, extensive
expertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which Medallia operates and experience in similar
situations.
Also on May 21, 2021, Ms. Oulman and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Financial B to
discuss financial due diligence matters.
On May 25, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley further discussed the list
of potential strategic and financial acquirers first presented at the meeting of the Strategic Committee on May 21,
2021. After discussion, the Strategic Committee determined that a list of nine potential acquirers-four strategic
acquirers and five financial acquirers (comprised of Thoma Bravo, Financial A, Financial B and Financial C (working
together with PortfolioCo as part of the Consortium Group), and a fifth financial acquirer that we refer to as
“Financial D”)-were the most likely to have an interest in acquiring Medallia and the ability to pursue an acquisition
on an expedited basis. The Strategic Committee assigned responsibility to Morgan Stanley and certain members of
the Strategic Committee to contact each potential
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
acquirer regarding its interest in an acquisition of Medallia (which assignments were based on the strength of
historical relationships with each potential acquirer). The representatives of Morgan Stanley also provided Morgan
Stanley’s preliminary views on our stock price performance and compared it to other companies and the broader
market. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that the strategic review process should be conducted
quickly to minimize distraction for Medallia’s management team. As such, the Strategic Committee instructed Morgan
Stanley to set proposed timelines with the potential acquirers, with the objective of receiving preliminary or revised
acquisition proposals from all of those interested by June 15, 2021.
Also on May 25, 2021, we formally retained Morgan Stanley.
Also on May 25, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with representatives of Financial D concerning
Financial D’s possible interest in exploring an acquisition of Medallia.

and PortfolioCo could combine their products and solutions.

representatives of PortfolioCo.

PortfolioCo to discuss our sales and go-to-market strategies and initiatives.
Also on May 28, 2021, during a portion of a regularly scheduled meeting of the Medallia Board, representatives of
Morgan Stanley provided the Medallia Board with an update on the strategic review process, including the identity
of the potential acquirers approved by the Strategic Committee on May 25, 2021. Members of Medallia management
reviewed with the Medallia Board a draft of the Projected Financial Information and described, among other things,
the process for preparing the Projected Financial Information, including the underlying assumptions and various
execution and other risks to realizing the Projected Financial Information. (The term Projected Financial Information is
defined in, and further information about the substance of the Projected Financial Information is contained in, the
section of this proxy statement captioned “-Projected Financial Information.”) The Medallia Board approved (1) the
use of the Projected Financial Information for purposes of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis of Medallia; and (2)
providing the Projected Financial Information to potential acquirers at the discretion of the Strategic Committee.
In early June 2021, consistent with the instructions of the Strategic Committee, Morgan Stanley informed each
potential acquirer that it should submit an initial or revised written indication of interest to acquire Medallia no later
than June 15, 2021.
On June 2, 2021, Mr. Stretch, Ms. Oulman, other members of Medallia management and representatives of Morgan
Stanley met with representative of Strategic A to discuss Medallia and its business.

interest and stated that they did not intend to further pursue an acquisition of Medallia.
During the course of reviewing strategic alternatives, Medallia ultimately entered into confidentiality agreements with
Strategic A, Thoma Bravo, Financial A, Financial B, Financial C, PortfolioCo and Financial D. None of these
confidentiality agreements included a “standstill” or a restriction on making acquisition proposals.
On June 15, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted a revised preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to acquire
Medallia in an all-cash transaction for $35.00 per share of our common stock.
On June 16, 2021, and in response to the Bloomberg article, a senior representative of a financial acquirer (which we
refer to as “Financial E”) contacted a representative of Morgan Stanley to inquire about any strategic review process
involving Medallia that was being conducted.
Also on June 16, 2021, Financial D submitted a preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to invest $700
million in Medallia through a convertible preferred equity instrument, with the proceeds being used to repurchase a
portion of our outstanding common stock.
Later on June 16, 2021, the Medallia Board met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The Medallia Board reviewed (1) the indications of interest from
Thoma Bravo and Financial D; and (2) the commentary provided by the four potential strategic acquirers, Financial A
and the Consortium Group as to why each was not pursuing an acquisition of Medallia. The representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed and discussed with the Medallia Board Morgan Stanley’s preliminary financial analysis of
Thoma Bravo’s June 15 proposal, and a summary of the proposal from Financial D. They also compared the Projected
Financial Information to publicly available estimates prepared by equity research analysts reporting on Medallia. It
was the consensus of the Medallia Board that we should continue discussions with each of Thoma Bravo and
Financial D. The Medallia Board instructed Morgan Stanley to inform Thoma Bravo and Financial D that Medallia
would permit an additional two weeks of due diligence. In addition, the Medallia Board instructed Morgan Stanley to
request that Thoma Bravo and Financial D improve
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the price and other terms of their proposals and submit revised proposals by July 1, 2021. Finally, Morgan Stanley
was instructed to inform Thoma Bravo that, although Thoma Bravo would be permitted to perform additional due
diligence, the Medallia Board expected Thoma Bravo to maintain a proposed acquisition price of no less than $35.00
per share of our common stock.
Following the meeting of the Medallia Board on June 16, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia
management and representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic
Committee discussed the indications of interest from Thoma Bravo and Financial D. The Strategic Committee also

repurchase a portion of our outstanding common stock. This indication of interest also lowered the proposed
dividend rate but kept the same conversion price from Financial D’s original proposal.
Also on July 1, 2021, representatives of Thoma Bravo informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Thoma Bravo
was lowering its proposal to acquire Medallia to $33.00 per share of our common stock, which reflected Thoma
Bravo’s latest assessment of Medallia’s valuation based on its ongoing due diligence review.
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 2, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the
members of Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The Strategic Committee discussed the proposals from Thoma
Bravo and Financial D. The Strategic Committee determined to (1) inform Thoma Bravo that the Medallia Board would
not consider an acquisition at a price of less than $35.00 per share of our common stock (which determination was
consistent with the expectation previously communicated to Thoma Bravo); (2) make a counterproposal to, and
continue negotiations with, Financial D; and (3) allow both Thoma Bravo and Financial D to conduct additional due
diligence. Members of Medallia management also provided an update on preliminary results for Medallia’s second
fiscal quarter, and confirmed that these results did not necessitate any updates to the Projected Financial Information.
On July 4, 2021, Financial D submitted a further revised preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to invest
$900 million in Medallia through a convertible preferred equity instrument, with the proceeds being used to
repurchase a portion of our outstanding common stock. This indication of interest also proposed alternative dividend
rates and conversion prices for the Medallia Board to consider. Thereafter, Morgan Stanley and Financial D
continued to negotiate the terms of Financial D’s proposal.
During the weeks of July 5, 2021, and July 12, 2021, Thoma Bravo and Financial D conducted additional due diligence.
On July 7, 2021, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to discuss Medallia and its
business.
On July 9, 2021, Ms. Oulman and other members of Medallia management met with representatives of Financial D to
discuss Medallia and its business.
On July 12, 2021, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman met with representatives of Financial D to discuss Medallia and its
business.
On July 13, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the
members of Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed and
discussed Morgan Stanley’s preliminary financial analysis of the proposal from Financial D. After discussing the
proposal made by Financial D, the Strategic Committee determined that a minority investment of the type
contemplated by Financial D was not of interest. The Strategic Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to inform
Financial D of (1) this decision; (2) the Strategic Committee’s preference for a transaction involving the acquisition of
all of Medallia at a price in cash in excess of $35.00 per share of our common stock; and (3) the Strategic Committee’s
desire that Financial D pursue an acquisition of all of Medallia (whether on its own or in partnership with another
financial acquirer). The Strategic Committee further instructed Morgan Stanley to reinforce with Thoma Bravo that
the Medallia Board was interested in an acquisition at a price in cash of $35.00 per share of our common stock with
high deal certainty. The Strategic Committee also reviewed the results of the strategic review process. As part of this
review, the Strategic Committee noted (1) the June 11, 2021, Bloomberg article speculating that Medallia was pursuing
a sale process; (2) the absence, following that article, of any expressed interest in pursuing an acquisition of Medallia
by anyone other than Financial E and Financial F; and (3) the failure by Financial E and Financial F to affirmatively
state a specific interest in acquiring Medallia or to pursue any discussions regarding an acquisition. Given these
considerations, the Strategic Committee discussed (1) the solicitation efforts engaged in by Morgan Stanley and (2)
whether additional affirmative contacts with other potential acquirers (including Financial E or Financial F) were
warranted. Notwithstanding the Strategic Committee’s satisfaction with the solicitation efforts to date, the Strategic
Committee also discussed the possibility of negotiating for a “go-shop” provision in any definitive merger agreement
governing an acquisition of Medallia. Such a provision would permit Medallia, for a specified period, to affirmatively
solicit alternative transactions following entry into the definitive merger agreement. Members of Medallia
management also provided an update on preliminary results for Medallia’s second fiscal quarter, and confirmed that
these results did not necessitate any updates to the Projected Financial Information. Mr. Stretch confirmed to the
Strategic Committee that neither he nor any other member of Medallia management had engaged in any discussions
with Thoma Bravo or any other potential acquirer concerning any “rollover” of
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any equity stake in Medallia in connection with a potential acquisition, or any or potential terms of employment
following an acquisition. Following the meeting, at the direction of the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley informed
Thoma Bravo and Financial D of the Strategic Committee’s respective determinations.
On July 15, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted a revised preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to acquire
Medallia in an all-cash transaction for $33.75 per share of our common stock.
Later on July 15, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of
each of Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the
members of Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The Strategic Committee reviewed the latest proposal from
Thoma Bravo and the status of discussions with Financial D (including Financial D’s continued focus on, and
preference, for a minority investment, as well as the additional time and uncertainty surrounding any potential
proposal by Financial D to acquire of all of Medallia). The Strategic Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to (1) reject
Thoma Bravo’s latest acquisition proposal and request a “best and final” proposal from Thoma Bravo (which
proposal should provide (a) for a “go-shop” process and (b) that Thoma Bravo would commit to fund, through
equity investments, the entire purchase price, which would eliminate the need to obtain debt financing from third
parties and the uncertainty related to that process); (2) inform Financial D that Medallia was only interested in
receiving a proposal for an acquisition of all of Medallia and that such proposal should be provided quickly; and (3)
speak again with Financial F to (a) ascertain whether Financial F was open to considering an acquisition on an
immediate timetable; and (b) gauge Financial F’s possible interest in partnering with Thoma Bravo or Financial D,
given that those firms had conducted a significant amount of due diligence. Following the meeting, at the direction of
the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley informed Thoma Bravo and Financial D of the Strategic Committee’s
respective determinations.
On July 16, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted a revised preliminary, nonbinding written indication of interest to acquire
Medallia in an all-cash transaction for $34.00 per share of our common stock. Thoma Bravo also expressed a
willingness to consider permitting a “go-shop” process, but declined to provide a full equity commitment for the
entire purchase price.
Also on July 16, 2021, the Strategic Committee approved allowing Financial D to speak with Financial A and Financial
B regarding the willingness of either firm to partner with Financial D to pursue an acquisition of Medallia.
Also on July 16, 2021, a representative of Financial D informed a representative of Morgan Stanley that Financial D
(1) continued to prefer a minority investment in Medallia; and (2) would not be in a position to make any proposal for
an acquisition of all of Medallia for several weeks based on the additional due diligence that it would need to perform.
Financial D also expressed that it was not likely to participate in any “go-shop” process involving Medallia.
On July 18, 2021, the Medallia Board met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the
members of the Medallia Board their fiduciary duties. The Medallia Board reviewed (1) the latest acquisition proposal
from Thoma Bravo; and (2) the status of discussions with Financial D. The Medallia Board considered the
uncertainty surrounding any potential acquisition proposal from Financial D. It was the consensus of the Medallia
Board to pursue a transaction with Thoma Bravo. The Medallia Board did not accept Thoma Bravo’s proposal, but
did instruct Wilson Sonsini to proceed with negotiating an appropriate merger agreement, with the objective
(assuming satisfactory resolution of outstanding points) of being able to announce an acquisition of Medallia by
Thoma Bravo no later than July 26, 2021. The Medallia Board also instructed Morgan Stanley to continue to
encourage Financial D to submit a proposal to acquire all of Medallia.
On July 19, 2021, a representative of Morgan Stanley spoke with a representative of Financial F concerning Financial
F’s willingness to consider an acquisition of Medallia on an immediate timetable and possible interest in partnering
with another buyer. The representative of Financial F did not express a desire by Financial F to pursue an acquisition
of Medallia.
Early on July 20, 2021, Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of Medallia, provided a draft merger agreement to legal counsel to
Thoma Bravo.
Following delivery of the draft merger agreement, representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and legal counsel to
Thoma Bravo met regularly to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement and related disclosure
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
letter. The principal areas of negotiation in the merger agreement included (1) the terms of the “go-shop” provision;
(2) the termination fees payable by each of Medallia and Thoma Bravo and the circumstances in which those fees
would be payable; (3) Thoma Bravo’s request to be able to delay the closing of the merger until November 1, 2021, in
certain instances; and (4) the treatment of equity awards held by all of Medallia’s employees in the acquisition.
Wilson Sonsini and legal counsel to Thoma Bravo also negotiated the terms of the limited guaranty, the equity
commitment letter and the voting agreements.
Also on July 20, 2021, a representative of Morgan Stanley spoke with a representative of Financial A concerning
Financial A’s interest in partnering with Financial D. The representative of Financial A stated that Financial A had
concerns about Medallia’s valuation and was busy with other projects. As such, Financial A did not have any
interest in further considering any participation in an acquisition of Medallia.
Also on July 20, 2021, a representative of Morgan Stanley spoke with a representative of Financial B concerning
Financial B’s interest in partnering with Financial D. The representative of Financial B stated that, after speaking with
a representative of Financial D, a partnership with Financial D did not impact Financial B’s view of Medallia’s
valuation. As such, Financial B did not have any interest in further considering any participation in an acquisition of
Medallia.
On July 21, 2021, Ms. Oulman and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Thoma Bravo on
two occasions to discuss due diligence matters.
On July 22, 2021, Mr. Stretch, Ms. Oulman and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Thoma
Bravo to discuss due diligence matters.
On July 23, 2021, a representative of Financial F spoke with a representative of Morgan Stanley. During this
conversation, the representative of Financial F stated that, following additional review, Financial F did not have an
interest in performing additional work to explore an acquisition of Medallia (either alone or in partnership with
another buyer).
On July 23, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed and discussed
Morgan Stanley’s preliminary financial analysis of the acquisition of Medallia by Thoma Bravo. The representatives
of Wilson Sonsini discussed the terms of the draft merger agreement and the points that remained under negotiation.
The representatives of Morgan Stanley described the current status of discussions with Financial D, including that
(1) Financial A, Financial B and Financial F had all declined to partner with Financial D on an acquisition of Medallia
or pursue an acquisition on their own; (2) Financial D continued to prefer a minority investment in Medallia; and (3)
Financial D would need additional time to be in a position to decide whether it could pursue an acquisition of all of
Medallia. The Strategic Committee determined to continue working with Thoma Bravo toward an acquisition.
Although the Strategic Committee determined not to seek a further price increase from Thoma Bravo, it instructed
Wilson Sonsini to continue to negotiate the draft merger agreement, with a focus on providing a high level of closing
certainty for Medallia and appropriate flexibility for Medallia to solicit alternative transactions during the “go-shop”
period.
On July 24, 2021, Morgan Stanley provided the Medallia Board with customary disclosures regarding Morgan
Stanley’s relationships with Thoma Bravo and its affiliates and Financial D and its affiliates.
On July 25, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. Members of Medallia management provided an update on
preliminary results for Medallia’s second fiscal quarter. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the
members of the Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed and
discussed Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis of the acquisition of Medallia by Thoma Bravo. The representatives of
Morgan Stanley noted that Financial D had declined to make a proposal to acquire all of Medallia despite repeated
requests that it do so. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the key terms of the merger agreement, the
limited guaranty, the equity commitment letter and the debt commitment letter. The Strategic Committee reviewed the
request of Medallia management to retain two additional financial advisers-BofA Securities, Inc. (which we refer to as
“BofA Securities”) and Wells Fargo Securities-to work with Morgan Stanley during the “go-shop” period. The
Strategic Committee also noted the customary relationship disclosures provided by Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities
and Wells Fargo Securities regarding each financial adviser’s relationships with Thoma Bravo and its affiliates; the
Strategic Committee did not identify any
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
concerns with these disclosures. The Strategic Committee approved the retention of BofA Securities and Wells Fargo
Securities given (1) the familiarity of these financial advisers with Medallia and participants in its industry; and (2) a
desire to ensure that the “go-shop” process was conducted in as robust a manner as possible. The Strategic
Committee determined to recommend that the Medallia Board approve the entry into the merger agreement.
Later on July 25, 2021, the Medallia Board met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. Members of Medallia management provided an update on
preliminary results for Medallia’s second fiscal quarter. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the
members of the Medallia Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed and discussed
Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis of the acquisition of Medallia by Thoma Bravo. The representatives of Wilson
Sonsini reviewed the key terms of the merger agreement, the limited guaranty, the equity commitment letter and the
debt commitment letter. The representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered Morgan Stanley’s oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Medallia Board that, as of July 25, 2021, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share price to be received by our
stockholders (other than the holders of the excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to such stockholders. The Strategic Committee provided its recommendation that the Medallia
Board approve the entry into the merger agreement. Mr. Stretch confirmed to the Medallia Board that neither he nor
any other member of Medallia management had engaged in any discussions with Thoma Bravo concerning any
“rollover” of any equity stake in Medallia in connection with a potential acquisition, or any potential terms of
employment following an acquisition. The Medallia Board noted the customary relationship disclosures provided by
Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Wells Fargo Securities regarding each financial adviser’s relationships with
Thoma Bravo and its affiliates; the Medallia Board did not identify any concerns with these disclosures. The
Medallia Board, after considering the factors more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Recommendation of the Medallia Board and the Reasons for the Merger,” (1) determined that the merger agreement,
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were fair to, advisable and in the best
interests of Medallia and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The representatives of Morgan Stanley described
solicitation activities that could be undertaken during the “go-shop” period. The Medallia Board directed the
Strategic Committee to oversee Medallia management, Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Wells Fargo Securities as
they engaged in these activities following the entry into, and public disclosure of, the merger agreement.
Still later on July 25, 2021, the merger agreement, limited guaranty, equity commitment letter, debt commitment letter
and voting agreements were signed.
Early on July 26, 2021, before the opening of trading on the NYSE, we publicly disclosed our entry into the merger
agreement.
Also on July 26, 2021, as directed by the Medallia Board, members of Medallia management and representatives of
each of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Wells Fargo Securities began contacting potential strategic and
financial acquirers (including Strategic A, Strategic B, Strategic C, Strategic D, Financial A, Financial B, Financial C,
Financial D, Financial E and Financial F) about their interest in participating in the “go-shop” process.
On July 30, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Medallia management and representatives of each of
Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The members of Medallia management and the representatives of
Morgan Stanley described their efforts in support of soliciting an alternative transaction to that contemplated by the
merger agreement.
On September 7, 2021, Medallia announced that the “go-shop” period expired on September 4, 2021, without any
alternative acquisition proposals having been received. During the “go-shop” period, Morgan Stanley, BofA
Securities and Wells Fargo Securities, on behalf of Medallia, actively solicited 38 parties (composed of 19 strategic
acquirers and 19 financial acquirers) regarding their interest in pursuing an acquisition of Medallia.

Recommendation of the Medallia Board
The Medallia Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Medallia and its
stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.
The Medallia Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2)
“FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in connection
with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of
the special meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Medallia Board consulted with Medallia management, as well
as representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley. In recommending that Medallia stockholders vote
“FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement, the Medallia Board considered and analyzed a number of factors,
including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based on these
consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Medallia Board concluded that
entering into the merger agreement with Parent was advisable and in the best interests of Medallia and our
stockholders.
The Medallia Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and
recommendation:
•
Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Prospects of Medallia; Risks of Execution. The current,
historical and projected financial condition, results of operations and business of Medallia, as well as
Medallia’s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In particular, the Medallia
Board considered Medallia’s current business plan and long-term operating plan (as reflected in the
Projected Financial Information). The Medallia Board considered these plans and the potential
opportunities that they presented against, among other things: (1) the risks and uncertainties associated
with achieving and executing Medallia’s current business plan and long-term operating plan in the short
and long term; (2) the impact of market, customer and competitive trends on Medallia; and (3) the general
risks related to market conditions that could reduce the price of our common stock. Among the potential
risks identified by the Medallia Board were:
○
Medallia’s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among these
risks were consideration of (1) Medallia’s size, as well as its financial resources, relative to those of its
competitors; (2) new and evolving competitive threats; and (3) the substantial risks to achieving
Medallia’s long-term operating plan. The Medallia Board was also aware that adoption of Medallia’s
product offerings is subject to competing strategic and financial priorities among its existing and
potential customers; as a result, existing customers may determine to reduce or eliminate their use of
Medallia’s product offerings, and potential customers may determine not to adopt them at all, any of
which could impact Medallia’s operating results.
○
Medallia’s historical customer churn rate and the impact that this has had, and could continue to have,
on Medallia’s ability to achieve stable and consistent operating results.
○
The historical quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in Medallia’s bookings and the impact that these
fluctuations have had, and could continue to have, on Medallia’s stock price.
○
The continued business and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the
possibility that business conditions-for Medallia and the larger economy-will not improve and could
get worse. In this regard, the Medallia Board was aware that some of Medallia’s customers are
associated with the hospitality industry, which has been particularly impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. Decreased demand for hospitality services-whether due to “stay-at-home” orders or an
unwillingness of people to travel-could have significant and prolonged effects on demand for
Medallia’s products by these customers.
42TABLE OF CONTENTS
○
The challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly traded
company, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarter-over-quarter performance. The Medallia
Board was aware that the price of our common stock could be negatively impacted if Medallia failed to
meet investor expectations, including if Medallia failed to meet its growth objectives.
○
The historical execution of Medallia’s business plan by Medallia management and their ability to
continue to drive Medallia’s business. In this regard, the Medallia Board was aware of instances in
which Medallia failed to achieve certain expectations of Medallia’s financial and operational
performance, and of the impact that these failures had on the price of our common stock.
•
Results of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of an extensive strategic review process
overseen by the Strategic Committee. The Medallia Board considered that, at Medallia’s direction, Morgan
Stanley affirmatively contacted four potential strategic acquirers and five financial acquirers (including
Thoma Bravo) concerning their interest in an acquisition of Medallia. The Medallia Board considered the
nature of the engagement by each of these potential acquirers over a multiple week period and that, of
these potential acquirers, only Thoma Bravo made a proposal for an acquisition of Medallia that was
capable of being accepted. The Medallia Board also was aware of the public speculation since early June
2021 that Medallia was pursuing a sale and noted that, following such speculation, two additional financial
acquirers (and no strategic acquirers) contacted Medallia about pursuing an acquisition. Neither of these
financial acquirers engaged in substantive discussions regarding an acquisition or made a proposal that
was capable of being accepted.
•
Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the merger consists entirely of
cash, which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business and financial execution
risks of Medallia’s long-term operating plan. The receipt of cash consideration eliminates uncertainty and
risk for our stockholders related to the continued execution of Medallia’s business. In that regard, the
Medallia Board noted that Medallia’s stock price could be negatively impacted if we failed to meet investor
expectations.
•
Best Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Medallia Board that the per share merger
consideration represents the best value reasonably obtainable for the shares of our common stock, taking
into account the Medallia Board’s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy,
assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Medallia on a historical and prospective basis. In
addition, the Medallia Board believed that, measured against the longer-term execution risks described
above, the per share merger consideration reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of our common
stock. The Medallia Board also considered that the per share merger consideration constitutes (1) a
premium of approximately 20 percent to the closing price of our common stock on June 10, 2021, which was
the last full trading day before public speculation that Medallia was pursuing a sale; and (2) a premium of
approximately 29 percent to Medallia’s unaffected 30-day price average.
•
Permitted Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Proposals. The merger agreement permitted Medallia and
its representatives, at the direction of the Medallia Board, from the date of the merger agreement until the
no-shop period start date, to (1) initiate, solicit, propose, induce or encourage any alternative acquisition
proposals from third parties; (2) provide nonpublic information to third parties; and (3) participate in
discussions and negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.
•
Potential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Medallia Board that none of the possible
alternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate Medallia as an independent
company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives,
as well as the potential benefits and risks to Medallia’s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing
and likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for us
to create greater value for our stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business,
competitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory risks.
•
Fairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley. The oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Medallia Board,
subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of July 25, 2021, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the
scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share
43

price to be received by our stockholders (other than the holders of the excluded shares) pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders. The opinion is more fully
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-",52,56

The Medallia Board retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in
connection with the possible sale of Medallia. The Medallia Board selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial
advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, extensive expertise and international reputation, its knowledge of
and involvement in recent transactions in Medallia’s industry, and its knowledge of Medallia’s business and affairs.
At the meeting of the Medallia Board on July 25, 2021, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, that, as of July 25, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share price to be received by our stockholders (other than the

stockholders.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of July 25, 2021, which sets forth, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as

Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You
are encouraged to read Morgan Stanley’s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was

of the per share price to be received by our stockholders (other than the holders of the excluded shares) pursuant to
the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not address the relative merits of the merger as
compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives
could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as
to how our stockholders should vote at the special meeting. The summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth
below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
•

dated July 24, 2021; and certain related documents; and
•

Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
46TABLE OF CONTENTS
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan
Stanley by Medallia and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to the financial projections, Morgan
Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of Medallia management of the future financial performance of Medallia. Morgan Stanley expressed
no view as to the financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley
assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without
any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent will obtain
financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the equity commitment letter and the debt commitment letter, and
that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to
Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental,
regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or
restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be
derived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial
advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Medallia and its legal, tax or
regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or
whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with
respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Medallia’s officers, directors or
employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the per share price to be received by the holders of shares of our
common stock (other than the holders of the excluded shares) in the merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any
independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Medallia, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any
such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and
other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, July 25, 2021. Events
occurring after July 25, 2021 may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and
Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion
and the preparation of its written opinion letter dated July 25, 2021 to the Medallia Board. The following summary is
not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered
by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative
importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables
must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering
any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and relied
upon (1) the management case and (2) the estimates set forth in an equity research analyst report, which was selected
by Morgan Stanley, and reviewed, and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use, by Medallia management (which we refer
to as the “street case”). Such equity research analyst was selected as a relatively close proxy for consensus
estimates. The management case is more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Projected Financial Information.” In accordance with direction from the Medallia Board, Morgan Stanley utilized the
street case and management case in its financial analyses described below. For purposes of its financial analyses
described below, Morgan Stanley treated Medallia’s fiscal year projections, which end at the end of January for each
fiscal year, as the prior calendar year projections. For example, fiscal year 2022 (ending January 2022) is treated as the
equivalent of calendar year 2021 (ending December 2021).

Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a
company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared
certain financial estimates for Medallia with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research
estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that share
similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things,
similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar
operating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the “comparable companies”). These companies were
the following:
Adobe Inc.
Anaplan, Inc.
Blackline, Inc. 
Cisco Systems, Inc.
Coupa Software Inc.
Five9, Inc.
HubSpot Inc.
Qualtrics International Inc.
RingCentral, Inc.
Salesforce.com, Inc.
ServiceNow, Inc.
Splunk Inc.
Momentive Global Inc.
Twilio Inc.
Workday, Inc.
Zendesk, Inc.
Zuora Inc.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue, which, for
purposes of this analysis, (1) for Medallia, (a) was provided to Morgan Stanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley’s
use, by Medallia management for calendar years 2021 and 2022 for the management case, and (b) was based on the
estimates of a selected publicly available equity research analyst for calendar years 2021 and 2022 for the street case
and approved for use by Morgan Stanley by the management of Medallia; and (2) for each of the comparable
companies, was based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for comparison purposes.
For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined “aggregate value” as a company’s fully diluted equity value
plus total debt, plus noncontrolling interest, plus preferred stock, less cash and cash equivalents.
Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its
professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of aggregate value to
estimated revenue multiples, and applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant revenue metric for
Medallia. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized publicly available financial information, available as
of July 23, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Medallia Board to approve and adopt the merger
agreement).

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to Medallia. In evaluating the comparable
companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Medallia’s
control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Medallia’s business and the industry
generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects
of Medallia and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the
average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.
Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the
potential future equity value of a company as a function of such company’s estimated future revenue. The resulting
equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value. In connection with this
analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of our common stock on a
standalone basis for each of the street case and management case.
To calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized calendar year 2023 revenue
estimates under each of the street case and management case, respectively. For the street case, the 2023 revenue
estimate was extrapolated and reviewed and approved for use by Morgan Stanley by Medallia management. Based
upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied a forward range of
aggregate value to estimated revenue multiples (based on the range of aggregate value to revenue multiples for the
comparable companies) to these revenue estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future-implied fully diluted
aggregate value.
In each case, Morgan Stanley then added estimated future net cash (with such estimates provided by Medallia
management for the management case and extrapolated for the street case (which extrapolations were reviewed and
approved by Morgan Stanley’s use by Medallia management)) to Medallia’s future implied aggregate value to reach a
future implied fully diluted equity value. In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future-implied fully diluted
equity value by estimated fully diluted shares outstanding (with such estimates provided by Medallia management)
to calculate a per-share price. Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future share price by two years
to July 31, 2021, at a discount rate of 9.1 percent, which rate was selected based on Medallia’s estimated cost of
equity, which was arrived at by applying the capital asset pricing model, to calculate the discounted fully diluted
equity value.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a
company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company.
Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for our common stock based on a
discounted cash flow analysis to value Medallia as a stand-alone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the
management case for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as earnings (burdened by
stock based compensation expense) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, less (1) taxes, and (2) capital
expenditures, including capitalized research and development, and plus or minus changes in net working capital. The
management case included extrapolations through calendar year 2030 prepared by Morgan Stanley with the guidance
of Medallia management (which extrapolations were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by Medallia
management). The free cash flows and terminal values were discounted, using a midyear convention, to present
values as of July 31, 2021, at a discount rate ranging from 7.7 percent to 9.6 percent, which discount rates were
selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of
Medallia’s weighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the capital asset pricing model. Morgan
Stanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 3.0 percent to 4.0 percent as part of its analyses, with such rates selected
upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value was
then adjusted for net debt and further adjusted for the net present value of net operating losses.

Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a
company based on publicly available financial terms of selected comparable transactions. Morgan Stanley selected
such comparable transactions because they shared certain characteristics with the merger, most notably because
they were similar software transactions. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the multiple of aggregate value
of the transaction to the estimated next 12 months’ (which we refer to as “NTM”) revenue based on publicly available
information at the time of announcement of each such transaction.

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics and time frame for each of the transactions listed above and upon the
application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of the
aggregate value to the estimated NTM revenue multiples of the transactions, and applied these ranges of multiples to
the estimated calendar year 2021 NTM, based on the street case and management case. The following table

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent-transactions analysis is identical to Medallia or the merger. In
evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond Medallia’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Medallia’s
business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of Medallia and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the
public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to
which they are being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present value per share of Medallia
derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the per share price is not
necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the consideration for the merger, but is one
of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis
with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Medallia Board, including the following
information described in the sections of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC-
Illustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums,” “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC-Historical Trading Ranges”
and “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC-Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets.”
Illustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums
Morgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent transaction premiums analysis by reviewing software company
transactions larger than $1 billion in aggregate value since 2014. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the
distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (1) the implied premium to the acquired company’s
closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the last trading day prior to the share price
being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news); and (2) the implied premium to the acquired
company’s 52-week high closing share price prior to announcement.
Based on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment
and experience, Morgan Stanley selected (1) a representative range of premia and applied such range to Medallia’s
closing share price on June 10, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition
rumors) and (2) a representative range of premia and applied such range to Medallia’s 52-week high.

Historical Trading Ranges
Morgan Stanley noted certain trading ranges with respect to the historical share prices of our common stock. Morgan
Stanley reviewed a range of closing prices of our common stock for (1) various periods ending on July 23, 2021 (the
last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Medallia Board to approve and adopt the merger agreement) and (2) a
30-trading day period ending on June 10, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the share price being affected by
acquisition rumors). Morgan Stanley observed the following:

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for our common stock prepared and
published by equity research analysts prior to July 23, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the
Medallia Board to approve and adopt the merger agreement). These targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of the
future public market trading price of our common stock. The 25th to 75th percentile range of undiscounted analyst
price targets for our common stock was $40.00 to $44.00 per share as of June 1, 2021 to July 15, 2021, with a median of
$42.00 per share. Morgan Stanley discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for our common stock by
one year at a rate of 9.1 percent, which discount rate was selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its
professional judgment and experience, to reflect Medallia’s cost of equity. This analysis indicated an implied range of
fully diluted equity values for our common stock of $36.67 to $40.34, with a median of $39.00 per share, as discounted
by one year based on the 25th to 75th percentile undiscounted analyst price targets, as of July 23, 2021 (the last full
trading day prior to the meeting of the Medallia Board to approve and adopt the merger agreement).
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current
market trading prices for our common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future
financial performance of Medallia and future financial market conditions.
General
In connection with the review of the merger by the Medallia Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex
process and not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion,
Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to
any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without
considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and
opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other
analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As
a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be
Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual value of Medallia.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
Medallia’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Medallia’s business and the
industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and
prospects of Medallia and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan
Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial
point of view of the per share price to be received by our stockholders (other than the holders of the excluded shares)
pursuant to the merger agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of July 25, 2021 to the
Medallia Board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which shares of Medallia
common stock might actually trade.
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The per share price to be received by our stockholders (other than the holders of the excluded shares) in the
aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Medallia
and Parent and was approved by the Medallia Board. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Medallia Board during
these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to Medallia or the Medallia Board,
nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other
alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are
available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation
as to how our stockholders should vote at the special meeting.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Medallia Board were one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Medallia Board to recommend that the Medallia Board approve and adopt the merger agreement.
Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Medallia
Board with respect to the consideration pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Medallia Board would
have been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of
Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary
practice.
The Medallia Board retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and expertise.
Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual
wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage
activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment
banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any
time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may
trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt
or equity securities or loans of Medallia, Parent, Thoma Bravo and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or
any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition,
Morgan Stanley, its affiliates directors or officers, including individuals working with Medallia in connection with the
merger, may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by Thoma Bravo
or its affiliates and their affiliated funds’ respective portfolio companies (which we refer to collectively as the “Thoma
Bravo Related Entities”).
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Medallia Board financial advisory services
and an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex C, in connection with the
merger, and Medallia has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $45 million for its services, $5 million
of which has been paid following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to this proxy
statement as Annex C and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Medallia has
also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional
advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, Medallia has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley
and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any,
controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or
in connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not provided
financial advisory or financing services to Medallia. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion,
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory and financing services for the Thoma Bravo
Related Entities, and have received aggregate fees of approximately $20 to $35 million in connection with such
services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Medallia, Parent and
the Thoma Bravo Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the
rendering of these services.

Other than in connection with its regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, we do not, as a matter
of course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the
uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Medallia
management regularly prepares projections as to our future financial performance for internal use.
54TABLE OF CONTENTS
In connection with our strategic planning process, Medallia management prepared and provided to the Medallia
Board various unaudited forward-looking financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. This forward-
looking information is collectively referred to as the “Projected Financial Information.” The Projected Financial
Information was used by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion to the Medallia Board and related financial
analyses (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley &
Co. LLC”). A summary of the Projected Financial Information is set forth below.
The Projected Financial Information was used, at the direction of the Medallia Board, to extrapolate cash flows for
fiscal years 2022 through 2025 for purposes of Morgan Stanley’s discounted free cash flow analysis (as described in
more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC”). Such
extrapolations were reviewed by Medallia management and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by the Medallia
Board and Medallia management. At Medallia’s direction, Morgan Stanley relied on the accuracy and completeness
of the Projected Financial Information utilized in its financial analyses and advice to the Medallia Board, as well as the
assurances of Medallia management that (1) it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information inaccurate or misleading; and (2) the Projected Financial Information were reasonably prepared based on
the best currently available estimates and judgments of Medallia management of the future financial performance of
Medallia.
The Projected Financial Information was developed by Medallia management without giving effect to the merger or to
any changes to Medallia’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the merger. The
Projected Financial Information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed; it
should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Projected Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as “GAAP”). In addition, the
Projected Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by
the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information.
Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have (1) compiled,
reviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Projected Financial Information; (2)
expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or the achievability of the Projected
Financial Information; or (3) assumed any responsibility for the Projected Financial Information. Our independent
registered public accounting firm disclaims any association with the Projected Financial Information.
The Projected Financial Information was prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Medallia management. In the
opinion of Medallia management, the Projected Financial Information (1) was prepared on a reasonable basis; (2)
reflected the best estimates and judgments then available (taking into account the relevant information available to
Medallia management at that time); and (3) presented, to Medallia management’s knowledge, our expected future
financial performance within the parameters and under the assumptions specified in preparing the Projected Financial
Information. Because the Projected Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to
sensitivities and assumptions, as well as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business
developments. The Projected Financial Information also covers multiple years, and such information by its nature
becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Projected Financial Information is not, and should not be
considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Projected Financial Information is not fact and
should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of Medallia’s future results.
Although the Projected Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous
assumptions and estimates as to future events made by Medallia management. The Projected Financial Information
will be affected by our ability to achieve our strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The
Projected Financial Information reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.
Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Projected Financial Information not to be achieved
include, among others, (1) general economic conditions (including the impact of COVID-19); (2) the accuracy of
certain accounting assumptions; (3) changes in actual or projected cash flows; (4) competitive pressures; and (5)
changes in tax laws. Additional factors that may impact us or our business can be found in the various risk factors
included in our periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside
of our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Projected Financial Information will be realized, and
actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Projected Financial Information. The
Projected Financial Information may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and does not consider any
events or circumstances after the date that it was prepared, including the announcement of the entry into the merger

TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreement. You should evaluate the Projected Financial Information, if at all, in conjunction with our historical
financial statements and other information regarding Medallia contained in our public filings with the SEC. Except to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projected
Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such information was prepared or to reflect
the occurrence of future events, even if any or all of the assumptions underlying the Projected Financial Information
are shown to be in error or no longer appropriate.
Certain of the financial measures included in the Projected Financial Information are “non-GAAP financial measures.”
These are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP
financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-
GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial
measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.
Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to,
financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a
business combination transaction, such as the Projected Financial Information, are excluded from the definition of
“non-GAAP financial measures” under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Projected Financial
Information is not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would
otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of
non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Medallia Board or Morgan Stanley.
Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Projected Financial Information is provided in
this proxy statement.
The Projected Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. By including the Projected Financial
Information in this proxy statement, neither we nor any of our representatives has made or makes any representation
to any person regarding our ultimate performance as compared to the information contained in the Projected Financial
Information. The inclusion of the Projected Financial Information should not be regarded as an indication that the
Medallia Board, Medallia or any other recipient of the Projected Financial Information considered, or now considers,
the Projected Financial Information to be predictive of actual future results. Further, the inclusion of the Projected
Financial Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Medallia that the
information presented is material. The Projected Financial Information is included in this proxy statement solely to
give our stockholders access to the information that was made available to the Medallia Board and Morgan Stanley.
The Projected Financial Information is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any Medallia
stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal
rights with respect to their shares.
Except as noted below, the Projected Financial Information was provided to Thoma Bravo and its affiliates (including
Parent and Merger Sub).

When considering the recommendation of the Medallia Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that
are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders. Additionally, concurrently with the execution of
the merger agreement, our directors and named executive officers, in each case in their capacities as stockholders of
Medallia, entered into the voting agreements with Parent and Medallia. The voting agreements obligate these
persons (including, in some instances, affiliated venture funds) to vote their respective shares of our common stock
in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against any competing transaction. In (1) evaluating and
negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending that
the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Medallia Board was aware of and considered these
interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests are more fully described
below.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and officers of Medallia will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification and insurance coverage, including under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Indemnification and
Insurance.”
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
Treatment of Medallia Equity-Based Awards
As of August 20, 2021, there were outstanding awards of restricted stock units (or portions thereof) that are not
Medallia PSUs (as defined below) (which we refer to as “Medallia RSUs”) that cover an aggregate of 7,917,894 shares
of our common stock, of which Medallia RSUs covering an aggregate of 213,670 shares of our common stock were
held by our current non-employee directors and of which Medallia RSUs covering an aggregate of 1,527,704 shares of
our common stock were held by our current executive officers. As of the same date, there were outstanding awards of
restricted stock units (or portions thereof) for which vesting is subject to the achievement of performance-based
criteria (which we refer to as “Medallia PSUs”) that cover an aggregate of 986,618 shares of our common stock (at
target level of performance) and 1,580,213 shares of our common stock (at maximum level of performance), of which
Medallia PSUs covering an aggregate of 632,758 shares of our common stock (at target level of performance) and
1,042,880 shares of our common stock (at maximum level of performance) were held by our current executive officers
and of which none were held by our current non-employee directors.
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Medallia equity-based award, will be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total
number of shares of our common stock then subject to the vested Medallia equity-based award.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Medallia equity-based award will be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total
number of shares of our common stock then subject to the unvested Medallia equity-based award, which amount
will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its representatives through the applicable vesting
dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the unvested Medallia equity-based award

for which such cash amount was exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms. However, with respect to any
Medallia PSUs that remain outstanding and subject to performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the
effective time, the performance metrics of such Medallia PSUs will be deemed achieved at a specified level of
achievement that reflects the actual level of achievement as of the effective time, and the corresponding cash amount
shall be paid out in lump sum at the end of a period that corresponds to the applicable award’s performance period,
subject to the holder’s continued service through such date.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, performance metrics with respect to Medallia PSUs will be deemed
achieved at the following levels:
•
Medallia PSUs granted on April 15, 2019, will be deemed achieved at 50 percent of target levels;
•
Medallia PSUs granted on June 19, 2019, will be deemed achieved at 100 percent of target levels;
•

Treatment of Medallia Options
As of August 20, 2021, there were outstanding Medallia options to purchase an aggregate of 20,949,726 shares of our
common stock with an exercise price below the per share price, of which Medallia options to purchase an aggregate
of 3,150,000 shares of our common stock were held by our current non-employee directors and of which Medallia
options to purchase an aggregate of 11,547,692 shares of our common stock were held by our current executive
officers.
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Medallia option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per
share of such Medallia option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon exercise in full
of such Medallia option.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Medallia option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise
price per share of such Medallia option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon
exercise in full of such Medallia option, which cash amount will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent
and its representatives through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the unvested
Medallia option for which such cash amount was exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms.
Any Medallia options for which the exercise price per share of such Medallia options is equal to or greater than the
per share price will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect of such Medallia option. As of
August 20, 2021, there were no outstanding Medallia options with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the
per share price.
Treatment of the ESPP
From and after the date of the merger agreement, no further offering period or purchase period will commence
pursuant to the ESPP and no participant may increase his or her rate of payroll deductions under the ESPP. Any
offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be in progress as of the effective time of the
merger will be terminated no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger
occurs. We will make any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or
purchase period, but otherwise will treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and
completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP. Each outstanding purchase right under
the ESPP will be exercised as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the
merger occurs. On such exercise date, we will apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within each
participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares

TABLE OF CONTENTS
of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP and, promptly thereafter, will refund any remaining
amounts credited to each such account to the applicable participant. Immediately prior to and effective as of the
effective time of the merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger), we will terminate the ESPP. Of our
executive officers, none currently participate in the ESPP. Our non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in
the ESPP.
Equity Interests of Medallia’s Directors and Executive Officers
The following table sets forth for each person who has been a Medallia executive officer or member of the Medallia
Board at any time since the beginning of Medallia’s 2021 fiscal year, (1) the number of shares of our common stock

October 25, 2021 (which, solely for purposes of this proxy statement, is the assumed closing date of the
merger), in accordance with their regular vesting schedules and assuming continued service by the
individual through such date;
•
that the values of these shares of our common stock and equity awards are equal to the per share price of
$34.00 (minus any applicable exercise price in the case of the in-the-money Medallia options); and
•
that none of the individuals exercises any of his or her Medallia options on or before October 25, 2021, and
that no additional Medallia options, Medallia RSUs or Medallia PSUs are granted to any such individual on
or before such date.

Represents shares of our common stock directly held by the individual as of August 20, 2021, plus any shares of our common
stock subject to Medallia RSUs and Medallia PSUs that are scheduled to vest and be settled before October 25, 2021 (without
regard to any change in control-related accelerated vesting). The amounts shown are determined assuming that no individual will
dispose of shares of our common stock from August 20, 2021, through October 25, 2021, and that the Medallia RSUs and
Medallia PSUs scheduled to vest and be settled prior to October 25, 2021, are so settled. The number of shares shown does not
include shares of our common stock that the executive officer may purchase after the date of the merger agreement under the
ESPP. For additional information regarding the treatment of our ESPP in the merger, see the section of this proxy statement

Represents outstanding in-the-money Medallia options held by the individual. All options held by the individuals named in the
table above are in-the-money, and all such options are vested as of October 25, 2021. The values shown are determined as the
excess of (i) the total number of vested shares of our common stock subject to such Medallia options multiplied by the per share
price, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price for such Medallia options.
(3)
Represents outstanding Medallia RSUs and Medallia PSUs (at levels of achievement assumed in the merger agreement) that are
not scheduled to vest on or before October 25, 2021. The values shown with respect to Medallia RSUs and Medallia PSUs are
determined as the product of the per share merger consideration, multiplied by the total number of shares of our common stock
subject to Medallia RSUs or Medallia PSUs, as applicable. The number of shares of our common stock subject to Medallia PSUs is
based on the levels of achievement assumed in the merger agreement. Accordingly, the number of shares represents unvested
Medallia PSUs covering a total of 0 shares of our common stock for Mr. Stretch; 244,588 shares of our common stock for Ms.
Oulman; 52,223 shares of our common stock for Ms. Carducci; 60,298 shares of our common stock for Mr. Ottosson; and
131,906 shares of our common stock for Mr. Duan. As described further in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-

Plan” Medallia RSUs and Medallia PSUs outstanding as of the date of the closing of the merger (which date, solely for purposes of
this proxy statement, is assumed to be October 25, 2021) that are held by Medallia's non-employee directors will accelerate
vesting in full (at the levels of achievement assumed in the merger agreement, for Medallia PSUs). In addition, each of the
Medallia executive officers is eligible for vesting acceleration of his or her Medallia RSUs and Medallia PSUs in connection with
certain qualifying terminations of employment under the Severance Policy. For additional information regarding the Medallia
RSUs and Medallia PSUs for our named executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
2019 Equity Incentive Plan
We have granted certain Medallia RSUs and Medallia PSUs under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (which we refer to
as the “2019 Plan”) that are outstanding and held by our non-employee directors and executive officers, including
pursuant to our Outside Director Compensation Policy that are held by our non-employee directors. The 2019 Plan
and Outside Director Company Policy provide that in the event of a merger or change in control, with respect to
awards granted to a non-employee director, the participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise any
outstanding options and stock appreciation rights and all restrictions on other outstanding awards will lapse. The
2019 Plan further provides that in connection with such vesting acceleration, with respect to any awards with
performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria applicable to such award will be deemed
achieved at 100 percent of target levels. The closing of the merger will constitute a “change in control” under the
2019 Plan.
2017 Equity Incentive Plan
We have granted Medallia RSUs and Medallia options under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, that are
outstanding and held by our non-employee directors and executive officers.
2008 Equity Incentive Plan
We have granted Medallia options under our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, that are outstanding and held
by our non-employee directors and executive officers.
Severance Policy
In June 2019, our board of directors approved the following change of control and severance benefits for our current
executive officers and other key employees, pursuant to the Severance Policy.
The Severance Policy provides that if we terminate an executive officer’s employment outside of the period beginning
three months prior to and ending 12 months after a “change in control” (as defined in the Severance Policy) (we refer
to such period as the “change in control period”) other than for “cause” (as generally defined in the Severance
Policy), death or disability, the executive officer will receive the following:
•
a lump sum payment equal to six months’ base salary (12 months for Mr. Stretch);
•
a lump sum pro rata payment of the executive’s target annual bonus; and
•
payment of COBRA continuation coverage premiums for up to six months (12 months for Mr. Stretch), or
taxable payments in lieu of such payment.
The Severance Policy provides that if an executive officer’s employment is terminated during the change in control
period either by us other than for cause, death or disability or by the executive officer due to a “constructive
termination” (as defined within the officer’s participation agreement), the executive officer will receive the following:
•
a lump sum payment equal to 12 months’ base salary (18 months for Mr. Stretch);
•
a lump sum equal to a pro-rata target annual bonus for the year of termination plus 100 percent of the
executive’s target annual bonus for the year of termination (150 percent for Mr. Stretch);
•
payment of COBRA continuation coverage premiums for up to 12 months (18 months for Mr. Stretch), or
taxable payments in lieu of such payment; and
•
100 percent acceleration of unvested time-based equity awards; and payment of COBRA continuation
coverage premiums for up to 12 months (18 months for Mr. Stretch) or taxable payments in lieu of such
payments.
Golden Parachute Compensation
The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding certain
compensation for each of Medallia’s named executive officers that is based on, or that otherwise relates to, the
merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules,
and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable to Medallia’s
61
TABLE OF CONTENTS
named executive officers. Medallia’s “named executive officers” for purposes of the disclosure in this proxy
statement are Messrs. Stretch, Ottosson and Duan and Mses. Oulman and Carducci. For additional details regarding
the terms of the payments quantified below, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of
Medallia’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity-Based Awards” and “-Interests of
Medallia’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.”
The amounts in the table are estimated using the following assumptions and such additional assumptions as may be
set forth in the footnotes to the table:
•
that the effective time of the merger will occur on October 25, 2021 (which is the assumed closing date of
the merger solely for purposes of this proxy statement, including this golden parachute compensation
disclosure);
•
that the named executive officer will have a qualifying termination of his or her employment at the effective
time of the merger that results in severance benefits becoming payable to him under the Severance Policy;
•
that the equity awards that are outstanding as of October 25, 2021, are the equity awards that Medallia has
granted to the named executive officer through August 20, 2021; and
•
that the number of shares of our common stock subject to Medallia PSUs will be determined at the levels of
achievement provided for in the merger agreement.
The amounts reported below are estimates based on these and other assumptions that may or may not actually occur
or be accurate on the relevant date. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in
connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth below. Medallia’s named executive officers will not
receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation or tax reimbursements in connection with the merger. As
required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value of our common
stock have been calculated based on the per share price.

The amount for each named executive officer represents the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which the named
executive officer may become entitled under the Severance Policy in connection with a qualifying termination during the change
in control period, as described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of Medallia’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.” The amounts represent a lump sum cash payment equal to the
sum of (i) 12 months’ of each named executive officer’s base salary (or 18 months with respect to Mr. Stretch); and (ii) each
named executive officer’s pro-rata target annual bonus for the year of termination plus 100 percent of the executive’s target
annual bonus for the year of termination (or 150 percent with respect to Mr. Stretch). The following table sets forth the value of
each of the base salary and target incentive opportunity severance benefits payable to a named executive officer under the terms
of the Severance Policy.
(2)
This amount includes the “double-trigger” vesting acceleration of 100 percent of the unvested portion of the named executive
officer’s outstanding Medallia RSUs, Medallia PSUs (to the extent that the applicable performance metrics are deemed achieved
pursuant to the
62
TABLE OF CONTENTS
merger agreement), and Medallia options to which the named executive officer may become entitled pursuant to the treatment
of such awards under the Severance Policy in connection with a qualifying termination during the change in control period, as
described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of Medallia’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.”
With respect to Medallia RSUs, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price, multiplied by (ii) the total
number of shares of our common stock subject to the Medallia RSUs held by the named executive officer. Accordingly, the
amount represents unvested Medallia RSUs covering a total of 605,275 shares of our common stock for Mr. Stretch; 251,111
shares of our common stock for Ms. Oulman; 196,751 shares of our common stock for Ms. Carducci; 116,933 shares of our
common stock for Mr. Ottosson, and 160,980 shares of our common stock for Mr. Duan.
With respect to Medallia PSUs, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price, multiplied by (ii) the total
number of shares of our common stock subject to the Medallia PSUs held by the named executive officer that are deemed to have
satisfied the applicable performance condition pursuant to the merger agreement. Accordingly, the amount represents unvested
Medallia PSUs covering a total of 0 shares of our common stock for Mr. Stretch; 244,588 shares of our common stock for Ms.
Oulman; 52,223 shares of our common stock for Ms. Carducci; 60,298 shares of our common stock for Mr. Ottosson, and
131,906 shares of our common stock for Mr. Duan.
With respect to each Medallia option, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the sum of the per share price less the
applicable option’s per share exercise price, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of our common stock subject to the
Medallia option held by the named executive officer. Accordingly, the amount represents unvested Medallia options covering a
total of 2,824,822 shares of our common stock for Mr. Stretch; 270,841 shares of our common stock for Ms. Oulman; 19,377
shares of our common stock for Ms. Carducci; 22,921 shares of our common stock for Mr. Ottosson, and 0 shares of our
common stock for Mr. Duan.
(3)
This amount represents a lump sum cash payment equal to 12 months of premiums (18 months with respect to Mr. Stretch) that
the named executive officer otherwise would be required to pay for continued post-employment, group health coverage. These
amounts are a “double-trigger” severance benefit that each of Messrs. Stretch, Ottosson and Duan and Ms. Oulman and Ms.
Carducci may become entitled to receive under the Severance Policy in connection with a qualifying termination during the
change in control period, as described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of Medallia’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.”
(4)
Under the Severance Policy, amounts are subject to reduction in the event the named executive officer would receive a greater
benefit on an after-tax basis by having some of his or her change in control-related payments and benefits being cut back rather
than paying the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on such amounts. This amount assumes no such
reduction is applied.
Employment Arrangements Following the Merger
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Medallia’s executive officers have (1) reached an understanding on
potential employment or other retention terms with the surviving corporation or with Parent or Merger Sub; or (2)
entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding employment or other retention with the surviving
corporation or with Parent or Merger Sub to be effective following the consummation of the merger. However, prior to
the effective time of the merger, Parent or Merger Sub may initiate discussions regarding employment or other
retention terms and may enter into definitive agreements regarding employment or retention for certain of Medallia’s
employees to be effective as of the effective time of the merger.

If the merger is consummated, our stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement,
who properly demand an appraisal of their shares, who continuously hold their shares through the effective time of
the merger, who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL and who do not withdraw their
demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal may, subject to the conditions thereof, are entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as “Section
262.” Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” or
to a “holder of shares” are to a record holder of our common stock.
63TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other
advice and does not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section
262. Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in
that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of our common stock held of record in the name of
another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an
appraisal of such holder’s shares. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other
nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee
to ensure that appraisal rights are exercised. Stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262 as
well as the information discussed below.
Under Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock who (1) submit a
written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares to Medallia prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (3) continuously are the record holders
of such shares through the effective time of the merger; and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures and satisfy
certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of our common stock
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of our
common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,
together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown)
interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the
merger through the date of payment of the judgment. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware
Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal
proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of our
common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued or perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding
shares of our common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (2) the value of the
merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the “ownership
thresholds.” Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the
date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal,
interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to
such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record
date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This
proxy statement constitutes Medallia’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection
with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B. In connection with the
merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve
such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex B carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of
Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder
who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger
agreement without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures
for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of our common stock, Medallia believes that if a stockholder is
considering exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
64
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common stock must do ALL of
the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Medallia a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger
agreement at the special meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the
effective time of the merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares
before the effective time of the merger); and
•
a stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the surviving corporation must file a petition in
the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of the merger (the surviving corporation is under no
obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so).
In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine
stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted
appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement, each of our stockholders who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must
vote against the adoption of the merger agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares.
Filing Written Demand
A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Medallia, before the vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. In addition,
that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the
Internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will
nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of
record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record
through the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will,
unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the
stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a
stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing
instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the
merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing
to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal
satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from
any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger
agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the
vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered
in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on
behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Medallia of the identity of the holder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. If the shares are owned of record
in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed
by or on behalf of the record owner, and if such shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint
tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized
agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a
holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in
executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.

Attention: Corporate Secretary
At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock may
withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, by delivering to Medallia, as the surviving corporation, a
written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than
60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to
any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right
of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the
effective time of the merger. If Medallia, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a
demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such
stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder
will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could
be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify
each record holder of shares of our common stock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to
Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, that the merger has become
effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of
shares of our common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
(or the beneficial owner of such shares) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware
Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder,
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal.
The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders
should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the
fair value of the shares of our common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of our common stock who desire to
have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their
shares of our common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a
petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has complied
with the requirements for an appraisal of such holder’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled,
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Medallia has received
demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation must send
this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written
request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal,
whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving
corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a
stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of our common stock and a copy thereof is served
upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to
file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders
who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not
been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of
such petition be given to the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list at the
addresses stated therein. Any such notice shall also be given by one or more publications at least one week before
the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or any
other publication which the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The costs of any such notice are borne by
the surviving corporation.
After notice to dissenting stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court
of Chancery will determine the stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal
for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of
the appraisal proceedings. If any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who assert appraisal
rights unless (1) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one
percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section
262 or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued
and perfected exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of our common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at
least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal
rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of
Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the
amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into
account all relevant factors. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the Delaware Court of
Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking
appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262,
interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving
corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery; and (2) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in
an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme
Court stated that, in making this
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the
nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light
on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and
not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive
pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm
as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and
may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Medallia believes that the per share price is
fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court
of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value
higher or lower than, or the same as, the per share price. Neither Medallia nor Parent anticipates offering more than
the per share price to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Medallia and Parent reserves the rights
to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of our common stock is less than the per
share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been
satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of
the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems
equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also
order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata
against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each
party bears its own expenses.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to
perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of our common stock
will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share price
as provided in the merger agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such holder’s right to
appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the
stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such holder’s demand for appraisal and an
acceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with
Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of
record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger); provided, however, that if no petition for an
appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been
satisfied in respect of the stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if such stockholder delivers to the surviving
corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger,
either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving
corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval
of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares
in accordance with the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently,
any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to
exercise those rights.

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be
relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our common stock whose shares
are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to as the “Code”) Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court
decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) and other applicable
authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing
interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of our
common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for
investment purposes).
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant
to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
•
tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.
federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations,
partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders
in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated
investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules;
holders who hold their common stock as “qualified small business stock” for purposes of Sections 1045
and 1202 of the Code; Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by attribution) more than five percent of our
common stock; or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,
straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
•
tax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory transaction
or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
•
tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other
entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
•
tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
•
tax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income
with respect to the shares of our common stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial
statement” (as defined in the Code);
•
the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
•
any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
•
tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of
their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
69TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.
Partnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding
the consequences of the merger.
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger
described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would
ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX
LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) has a valid election
in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares
surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.
Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A
reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder
(including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different
blocks of shares of our common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted
tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock
that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax
unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained
by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation,
such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty);

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case
such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty); or
•
Medallia is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as “USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the five-year
period preceding the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable
shares of our common stock (which we refer to as the “relevant period”) and, if shares of our common
stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of
the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of our
common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except
that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its
U.S. real property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair
market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or
business. For this purpose, U.S. real property interests generally include land, improvements and
associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are
not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S.
Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if
we are a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by
a holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a
correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS
Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-
U.S. Holder’s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form); or (b)
otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
A U.S. holder may be required to retain records related to such holder’s common stock and file with its U.S. federal
income tax return, for the taxable year that includes the Merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the
merger.
Withholding on Foreign Entities
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder
(which we refer to as “FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a
“foreign financial institution” (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution enters into an
agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax
authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain
equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S.
owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on
certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a
certification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these
requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.
The Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would
eliminate the federal withholding tax of 30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of
our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers
may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Holders of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible
implications of FATCA on the disposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.

General Efforts
Under the merger agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and Medallia agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, do, or cause to be done, all things and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, or
causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the merger,
including: (1) obtaining all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations from governmental authorities;
and (2) making all registrations, declarations and filings with governmental authorities, in each case that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the merger.
HSR Act; Competition Laws
Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be completed until Parent and Medallia file a Notification and Report Form
with the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”), and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. The
parties filed a notification and report form with the FTC and DOJ on August 6, 2021. A transaction notifiable under
the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing
of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The waiting period
under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on September 7, 2021.
Under the Austrian Cartel Act, the merger cannot be completed until the merger is notified to the Federal Competition
Authority (Bundeswettbewerbsbehörde, which we refer to as the “FCA”) and the Federal Cartel Prosecutor
(Bundeskartellanwalt, which we refer to as the “FCP”) and the applicable waiting period has expired or been
terminated. The parties made the necessary notification on August 9, 2021. If neither the FCA nor the FCP apply to
the Cartel Court (Kartellgericht) for an in-depth investigation within the waiting period, the merger is deemed legally
cleared. The parties will receive a declaration confirming whether or not an in-depth investigation has been opened
one or two business days after expiration of the waiting period. The waiting period under the Austrian Cartel Act
expired at 11:59 p.m., Central European time, on September 6, 2021.
Medallia and Parent have each agreed to (1) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause the other
to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or
the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made; and (2) use its
respective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to, as soon as practicable, (a) cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws applicable to the
merger and (b) obtain any required consents pursuant to any antitrust laws applicable to the merger.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable,
including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or
requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At
any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, any state could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action
could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Medallia
or Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to, if and to the extent necessary
to obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws applicable to the merger, (1)
offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (a) the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether
tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and Medallia and its subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (b) any other restrictions on
the activities of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and Medallia
and its subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger.
72TABLE OF CONTENTS
Other Regulatory Approvals
One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it
grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory
process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even
preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain
all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a
substantial period of time between the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these
regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the
merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the
conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

Pursuant to the limited guaranty, the Thoma Bravo Fund has agreed to guaranty the due, punctual and complete
payment of certain of the liabilities and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the merger agreement plus
amounts in respect of certain reimbursement obligations of Parent and Merger Sub for certain costs, expenses or
losses incurred or sustained by Medallia, as specified in the merger agreement.
Subject to specified exceptions, the limited guaranty will terminate upon the earliest of:
•
the closing of the merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement;
•
the payment and discharge of any reimbursement obligations for which Medallia has requested
reimbursement within 90 days following the valid termination of the merger agreement;
•
the valid termination of the merger agreement other than a termination pursuant to which Medallia would be
entitled to a termination fee, in which case the limited guaranty will terminate 90 days after such termination
unless Medallia has delivered a written notice with respect to the guaranteed obligations; and
•

The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payment of consideration due to our
stockholders and the holders of other equity-based interests under the merger agreement, the repayment of all
obligations under Medallia’s existing credit agreement and the payment of all related fees and expenses, will be
funded with the proceeds of committed equity and debt financing, as further described below.
Pursuant to the equity commitment letter, the Thoma Bravo Fund has committed to capitalize Parent on the closing
date of the merger with an equity contribution in an aggregate amount of up to $5,028,000,000, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the equity commitment letter.
Pursuant to the debt commitment letter, the financial institutions party thereto (which we refer to as the “debt
financing sources”) have severally and not jointly committed (1) to provide to Merger Sub on the closing date of the
merger senior secured term loans; and (2) to make available to Merger Sub (a portion of which may be made available
to Merger Sub on the closing date of the merger) (or, after the closing date of the merger, to the surviving company,
as successor by merger to Merger Sub) a senior secured revolving credit facility, in each case, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter.
The obligation of the debt financing sources to provide the credit facilities described above is subject to customary
conditions, including the following:
•
the execution and delivery of definitive loan, guaranty and security documentation for the credit facilities
and the delivery of customary closing documents;
•
subject to customary limitations, the accuracy of certain representations and warranties made by Medallia
or with respect to the business of Medallia in the merger agreement (giving effect to the
73TABLE OF CONTENTS
materiality qualifiers contained in the merger agreement) that are material to the interests of the debt
financing sources but only to the extent they or their affiliates have the right (taking into account any
applicable cure provisions) to terminate their obligations under the merger agreement or not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as a result of a breach of such representations;
•
the substantially concurrent closing of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement (without any
amendment, modification or waiver of any of the provisions thereof that would be materially adverse to the
interests of the debt financing sources in their capacity as such without the approval of the lead arranger
(such approval not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed));
•
the occurrence or substantially concurrent funding of the equity contribution; and
•
that no Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred since the date of the merger agreement and be
continuing.
The Voting Agreements",84,85

In connection with entering into the merger agreement, on July 25, 2021, certain funds affiliated with Sequoia Capital,
as well as our directors and named executive officers, in each case in their capacities as stockholders of Medallia
(which we refer to as the “voting agreement stockholders”), entered into the voting agreements with Parent and
Medallia. As of the record date, the voting agreements cover approximately 34 percent of our common stock.
Under the voting agreements, the voting agreement stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of our
common stock (1) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger and other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and (2) against (a) any action or agreement that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to Medallia’s obligations set forth in the merger agreement
not being satisfied; and (b) any alternative acquisition proposal, or agreement, transaction or other matter that is
intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with or materially and adversely affect the
consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The voting
agreement stockholders have also waived appraisal rights in connection with the merger, and have agreed not to raise
certain legal challenges to the merger.
Pursuant to the voting agreements, the voting agreement stockholders have agreed not to, until the termination of
the voting agreements and subject to certain exceptions in the voting agreements, (1) directly or indirectly transfer,
either voluntarily or involuntarily, or enter into any option or other contract, arrangement or understanding with
respect to any transfer, of any of our common stock; (2) deposit any of our common stock into a voting trust, enter
into a voting agreements or arrangement (other than the voting agreements) with respect to our common stock or
grant any proxy or power of attorney (other than the voting agreements) with respect to our common stock; or (3)
enter into any contract or commitment to take any of the actions referred to in clauses (1) or (2).
The voting agreement stockholders’ obligations to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement terminate
automatically upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the time that our stockholders adopt the merger agreement; (2) the
effective time of the merger; (3) the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; (4) the
amendment of any term or provision of the merger agreement that reduces the per share price or changes the form of
consideration payable to the voting agreement stockholders under the merger agreement, without the voting
agreement stockholders’ prior consent; and (5) the occurrence of a change in the Medallia Board’s recommendation

On September 7, 2021, an individual action was filed against Medallia and the Medallia Board by a purported Medallia
stockholder in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. That action is captioned O’Dell v.
Medallia, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-07475. The complaint generally alleges that Medallia’s preliminary proxy statement
contained false or misleading statements regarding the merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange
Act. The allegations include that the preliminary proxy statement omitted material information regarding Medallia’s
financial projections and the analyses performed by Morgan Stanley. The action seeks, among other things, to (1)
enjoin defendants from consummating the merger unless and until defendants disseminate revised disclosures; (2)
rescind the merger or recover damages in the event that the merger is completed; and (3) attorneys’ fees and costs.
The defendants believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against them. Additional lawsuits
arising out of the merger may be filed in the future.

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of
Medallia’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation,” including the additional
disclosures referenced therein that otherwise are disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger-Interests of Medallia’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
We are asking our stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Medallia to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Medallia’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden
Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes and additional disclosures referenced therein. The
various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made generally have
previously formed part of Medallia’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously
have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of
our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation
Committee of the Medallia Board, which is composed solely of non-employee directors, and are believed to be
reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Medallia, Inc. approve the compensation that will or may become payable
to Medallia’s named executive officers in connection with the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger-Interests of Medallia’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” in Medallia’s proxy statement for the special meeting.”
Our stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and as a non-binding,
advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Medallia, the Medallia Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans
and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly,
regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated our named executive officers will be
eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the
terms and conditions applicable to those payments.
The Medallia Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the

session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies
from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting against adoption of the merger
agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the merger agreement such that the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement. Additionally, we may seek stockholder approval to adjourn the special meeting if a
quorum is not present. Finally, the chairperson of the special meeting is permitted by our bylaws to adjourn the

The following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger
agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the merger
agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, and in its entirety because this summary may not
contain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the
parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other
information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement
(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and
supplemental information agreed to by Medallia, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms
of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those
generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential
matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Medallia in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the
representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating
contractual risk between Medallia and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may
be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors.
Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the
circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.
Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the
actual state of facts or condition of Medallia, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or
businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change
after the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the
merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the
merger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the
respective businesses of Medallia, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are
either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to
by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is
described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Medallia, Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the
merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this
document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Medallia and our business.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than the second
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of
such conditions; or (2) at such other time agreed to by Medallia, Parent and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the
merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided
under the DGCL. If, on or prior to October 27, 2021, all of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement have been
and continue to be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of
which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or waived, then Parent may delay the closing until November 1,
2021. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a later time as
may be agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each
outstanding share of our common stock (other than shares: (1) held by Medallia as treasury stock; (2) owned by
Parent or Merger Sub; (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub; or (4)
held by stockholders who have properly and validly exercised, and not withdrawn or otherwise lost, their appraisal
rights under the DGCL) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the per share price in
cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement).
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of our common stock that is (1) held by Medallia as
treasury stock, (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent or Merger Sub will be cancelled and extinguished without any payment therefor.
At the effective time of the merger, each share of our common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of our
common stock of the surviving corporation and each certificate representing ownership of such shares of our
common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares of our common stock of the surviving
corporation.
Equity Awards; ESPP
The merger agreement provides that Medallia’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time of the merger:
Treatment of Medallia Equity-Based Awards
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Medallia equity-based award will be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total
number of shares of our common stock then-subject to such vested Medallia equity-based award.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Medallia equity-based award will be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the per share price and (2) the total
number of shares of our common stock then-subject to such unvested Medallia equity-based award, which amount
will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its
80TABLE OF CONTENTS
representatives through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the unvested Medallia
equity-based award for which such cash amount was exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms. However,
with respect to any awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions that remain outstanding and subject to
performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the effective time, the performance metrics of such awards
will be deemed achieved at a specified level of achievement that reflects the actual level of achievement as of the
effective time, and the corresponding cash amount shall be paid out in lump sum at the end of a period that
corresponds to the applicable award’s performance period, subject to the holder’s continued service through such
date.
Treatment of Medallia Options
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Medallia option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per share of such
Medallia option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon exercise in full of such
Medallia option.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Medallia option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price less the exercise price per share of
such Medallia option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable upon exercise in full of such
Medallia option, which cash amount will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its
representatives through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the unvested Medallia
option for which such cash amount was exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms. Any Medallia options
for which the exercise price per share of such Medallia options is equal to or greater than the per share price will be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect of such Medallia option.
Treatment of the ESPP
From and after the date of the merger agreement, (1) no further offering period or purchase period will commence
pursuant to the ESPP; and (2) no participant may increase his or her rate of payroll deductions under the ESPP. Any
offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be in progress as of the effective time of the
merger will be terminated no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger
occurs. We will make any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or
purchase period, but otherwise will treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and
completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP. Each outstanding purchase right under
the ESPP will be exercised as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the
merger occurs. On such exercise date, we will apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within each
participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP
and, promptly thereafter, will refund any remaining amounts credited to each such account to the applicable
participant. These shares will be deposited into the applicable participant’s account and will treated in the same
manner as any other outstanding share of common stock in connection with the consummation of the merger.

Prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to Medallia, which we refer to as
the “payment agent,” to make payments of the merger consideration to our stockholders. At or prior to the closing of
the merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the payment agent cash that is sufficient in the
aggregate to pay the aggregate per share price to our stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement.
Promptly (and in any event within one business day) following the effective time of the merger, Parent and the
surviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented
outstanding shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares), a letter of transmittal and instructions
advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for merger consideration. Upon
81TABLE OF CONTENTS
receipt of (1) surrendered certificates for cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates, together with any required bond); and (2) a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably requested by the payment agent, the holder of such certificate will be entitled
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock
represented by such certificate and (b) the per share price. The amount of any per share price paid to our
stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of our common stock held in book-entry form (which we refer to
as “uncertificated shares”) will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal (as both are
described above) to the payment agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof. Each holder of record
(as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of uncertificated shares that immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger represented an outstanding share of our common stock will, upon receipt of an “agent’s
message” in customary form at the effective time of the merger, and any documents as may reasonably be requested
by the payment agent, be entitled to receive, and the payment agent will pay and deliver as promptly as practicable,
an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock represented by
such holder’s transferred uncertificated shares; and (2) the per share price. The amount of consideration paid to such
Medallia stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the
merger, such cash will be returned to Parent upon demand, and any of our stockholders as of immediately prior to the
merger who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to
Parent for satisfaction of payment of the merger consideration (subject to abandoned property law, escheat law or
similar laws). None of the payment agent, Parent, the surviving corporation or any other party will be liable to any of
our stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar laws.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has
been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then the
payment agent will issue the per share price to such holder upon the making by such holder of an affidavit for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. Parent or the payment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of the per share price, require such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the
payment agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the surviving corporation
or the payment agent with respect to such certificate.

financial condition or results of operations of Medallia and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (2) would prevent the
consummation of the merger by Medallia prior to the termination date, but excluding, in each case, any such effect to
the extent resulting from:

foregoing) in the United States or any other country or region in the world, including an outbreak or

subsidiaries and their respective directors and executive officers not to, and it will not authorize or direct any of its or
its subsidiaries’ employees, consultants or other representatives to, directly or indirectly (except with respect to any
excluded party):
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage,
facilitate or assist, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal;

properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Medallia or any
of its subsidiaries (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees), in any such case in
connection with any acquisition proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an acquisition proposal or the making of
any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

acquisition proposal;
•

other contract relating to an acquisition transaction, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement; or
•
authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.
Under the merger agreement, from the no-shop period start date until Medallia’s receipt of the requisite stockholder
approval, Medallia and the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of
their representatives (including Medallia’s financial advisor), following the execution of an acceptable confidentiality
agreement, (1) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; (2) furnish any non-public information

•
any excluded party or its representatives; or
•
any person or its representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to Medallia a written acquisition
proposal after the no-shop period start date that was not solicited in material breach of the merger
agreement, but only if the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (1) such acquisition proposal either
constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; and (2) the failure to
take actions would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable law.
On and after the no-shop period start date, Medallia has agreed that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 48
hours from the receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing if any acquisition proposal, or inquiry from any person or
group related to making a potential acquisition proposal, is, to the knowledge of Medallia, received by, any non-
public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
Medallia or any of its representatives (other than by an excluded party). Such notice must include (1) the identity of
the person or group making such proposal, inquiry, request or offer (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to
the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such person or group that is in effect on the date of the merger
agreement); and (2) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and, if
in writing, a copy thereof.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement:
•
“excluded party” means a person or group that, prior to the no-shop period start date, has submitted a
written acquisition proposal to Medallia or one of its representatives that the Medallia Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; however, a
person shall immediately cease to be an excluded party (and the provisions of the merger agreement
applicable to excluded parties will cease to apply with respect to such person) if such alternative
acquisition proposal is withdrawn by such person, it being understood that a modification of an acquisition
proposal submitted by a person or group will not be deemed to be a withdrawal or

termination of an acquisition proposal by such person or group, but only if the Medallia Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith that such modified acquisition proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; and
•
“superior proposal” means any written acquisition proposal on terms that the Medallia Board (or a
committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) would be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to our stockholders (in their capacity
as such) than the merger (taking into account (1) any revisions to the merger agreement made or proposed
in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination; and (2) those factors and matters deemed
relevant in good faith by the Medallia Board (or any committee thereof). For purposes of the reference to an

The Medallia Board has recommended that the holders of shares of our common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, except as set forth below, at no time after the date of the
merger agreement may the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or
modify, the Medallia Board recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent;
•
adopt, approve or recommend an acquisition proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the Medallia Board recommendation within 10 business days of the occurrence of a
material event or development and after Parent so requests in writing (or, if the Medallia stockholder
meeting is scheduled to be held within 10 business days, then within one business day after Parent so
requests in writing) (it being understood that Medallia will not be obligated to affirm the Medallia Board
recommendation pursuant to the merger agreement on more than three occasions);
•
take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation in connection with a
tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen”
communication by the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) to our stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-
9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood
that the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an
acquisition proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the 10th business day after the commencement of a
tender or exchange offer in connection with such acquisition proposal without such action being
considered a violation of the merger agreement);
•
fail to include the recommendation of the Medallia Board to adopt the merger agreement in the proxy
statement (we refer to the actions described in these five bullets as a “Medallia Board recommendation
change”); or
•
cause or permit Medallia or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.
Other than in connection with a written acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior proposal, at any time prior to
obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Medallia Board
recommendation change in response to an intervening event if the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do
so would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law if and only if:
•
Medallia has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three business days in advance to the effect
that the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) has (1) so determined; and (2) resolved to effect a Medallia
Board recommendation change, which notice will specify the basis for such Medallia Board
recommendation change and will describe the intervening event in reasonable detail; and
•
prior to effecting such Medallia Board recommendation change, Medallia and its representatives, during
such three business day period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to
the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement and the transaction documents so that the Medallia Board (or a committee
90TABLE OF CONTENTS
thereof) no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Medallia Board recommendation
change in response to such intervening event would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; (2) taken into account any adjustments to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction documents proposed by Parent and other
information provided by Parent in response to the notice described in the paragraph above, in each case,
that are offered in writing by Parent, no later than 11:59 p.m. on the last day of such three business day
period, in a manner that would constitute a binding agreement between the parties if accepted by Medallia;
(3) permitted Parent and its representatives to make a presentation to the Medallia Board regarding the
Merger Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make
such a presentation) and (4) following such three business day period, the Medallia Board (or a committee
thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account
Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction
documents) has determined that the failure of the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) to make a
Medallia Board recommendation change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable law.
At any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, if Medallia has received a written acquisition
proposal that the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, then the Medallia Board may (1) effect a Medallia
Board recommendation change with respect to such superior proposal; or (2) authorize Medallia to terminate the
merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal, in each
case if and only if:
•
the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
•
Medallia has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the merger agreement with
respect to such acquisition proposal;
•
(1) Medallia has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three business days in advance (which we
refer to as the “notice period”) to the effect that the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) has (a)
received a written acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn; (b) concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal constitutes
a superior proposal; and (c) resolved to effect a Medallia Board recommendation change or to terminate the
merger agreement, which notice describes the basis for such Medallia Board recommendation change or
termination, including the identity of the person or group making such acquisition proposal, the material
terms of such acquisition proposal and include copies of all relevant documents relating to such
acquisition proposal; and (2) prior to effecting such Medallia Board recommendation change or termination,
Medallia and its representatives, until 5:00 p.m. on the last day of the notice period, have (a) negotiated
with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction documents so
that such acquisition proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal; (b) taken into account any
adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement proposed by Parent and other information
provided by Parent during the notice period, and the transaction documents in each case, that are offered
in writing by Parent, no later than 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the notice period, in a manner that would
constitute a binding agreement between the parties if accepted by Medallia; and (c) permitted Parent and
its representatives to make a presentation to the Medallia Board regarding the merger agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being
understood that (i) in the event of any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to such
acquisition proposal, Medallia will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with
the requirements of the merger agreement with respect to such new written notice (with the “notice period”
in respect of such new written notice being two business days); and (ii) at the end of the notice period, the
Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) must have in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that such acquisition proposal is a superior
proposal;

in the event of any termination of the merger agreement in order to cause or permit Medallia to enter into an
alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such acquisition proposal, Medallia will have validly
terminated the merger agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of the merger agreement,

•
will not and will instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives acting on its behalf
not to, disclose publicly the terms or other information with respect to any offer of, or negotiations with,

merger agreement is terminated (and then only to the extent required by applicable law).
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “intervening event” means any effect, or any
material consequence of such effect, that (1) as of the date of the merger agreement was not known or reasonably
foreseeable, in each case based on facts known to the Medallia Board as of the date of the merger agreement; and (2)
does not relate to (a) an acquisition proposal or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself, that Medallia meets or exceeds any
internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or
operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date of the merger agreement, or changes after the date of the
merger agreement in the market price or trading volume of our common stock or the credit rating of Medallia (it being
understood that the underlying cause of any of the foregoing in this clause (b) may be considered and taken into
account).

From and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will honor all of our arrangements providing
for compensation or employee benefits (which we refer to as “Medallia benefit plans”) in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, except that the surviving corporation is permitted to
amend or terminate Medallia benefit plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by applicable law.
As of the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation or one of its subsidiaries will continue to employ all
of our employees and all of the employees of our subsidiaries. For a period of one year following the effective time of
the merger (or until an earlier termination of employment for a particular continuing employee), the surviving
corporation and its subsidiaries generally will either (1) maintain for the benefit of continuing employees the Medallia
benefit plans (other than excluded benefits) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect on the
date of the merger agreement; (2) provide other compensation and benefits (other than excluded benefits) to each
continuing employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and
benefits (other than the excluded benefits) provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective
time; or (3) provide some combination of Medallia benefit plans and comparable plans such that each continuing
employee receives compensation and benefits (other than excluded benefits) that, taken as a whole, are substantially
similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than excluded benefits) provided to such continuing
employee immediately prior to the effective time. In each case, base compensation and target annual or shorter-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities will not be decreased during the one-year period following the effective
time of the merger for any continuing employee employed during that period. During the one-year period following
the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will provide to continuing employees severance benefits
that are no less favorable than those provided by Medallia and its subsidiaries as of the date of the merger
agreement.
Continuing employees generally will be granted service credit for service with us and our subsidiaries prior to the
effective time of the merger and with Parent, the surviving corporation and any of their subsidiaries on or after the
effective time of the merger, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting in 401(k) or similar retirement benefits
and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement but not for purposes of a defined benefit pension plan or equity or equity-based

commercially reasonable efforts to (1) permit continuing employees to participate immediately in any new
compensation or benefit arrangements that replace Medallia benefit plans to the same extent as they were eligible
under the replaced Medallia benefit plans; (2) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or similar
requirements to be waived to the same extent they were waived under the replaced Medallia benefit plans; (3) cause
any eligible expenses paid by a continuing employee and his or her covered dependents under a Medallia benefit
plan to be given credit with respect to any new benefit arrangement that replaces the applicable Medallia benefit plan
for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements for the applicable plan year; and (4) credit continuing employees for any unused balances in
flexible spending accounts. Continuing employees will also receive credit for any accrued but unused vacation or
paid time off as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.",103,104

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, if any portion of the debt financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any “flex” provisions) contemplated in the debt commitment
letters, then Parent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event:
•
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the debt commitment letters
and the fee letters and in an amount at least equal to the debt financing or such unavailable portion thereof,
as the case may be (which we refer to as the “alternate debt financing”); and
•
one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such alternate debt financing (which we refer
to as the “new debt commitment letters”), which new debt commitment letters will replace the existing debt
commitment letters in whole or in part.
Parent has agreed to promptly provide a copy of any new debt commitment letters (and any fee letter in connection
therewith, which may be delivered with the fee amounts and “flex” terms redacted in a customary manner so long as
no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination of the
alternate debt financing) to Medallia.
Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to seek to enforce, including by bringing a legal proceeding for specific
performance, the equity commitment letter if Medallia seeks and is granted a decree of specific performance of the
obligation to consummate the merger after all applicable conditions to the granting thereof set forth in the merger
agreement have been satisfied.
Under the merger agreement, Medallia agreed to use, and to cause its subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts
to provide Parent and Merger Sub with all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub to assist them

•
our stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting, except that a party may
not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such party’s action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of the merger agreement and causes, or results in, the failure to obtain the
approval of our stockholders at the special meeting;
•
by Medallia if:
•
subject to a 45-day cure period, Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger
agreement such that the related closing condition would not be satisfied;
•
prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders: (1) Medallia has received a
superior proposal; (2) the Medallia Board (or a committee thereof) has authorized Medallia to enter
into an alternative acquisition agreement to consummate the acquisition transaction contemplated by
that superior proposal; (3) concurrently with such termination, Medallia pays the applicable
termination fee; and (4) Medallia has complied in all material respects with its covenants under the
merger agreement with respect to soliciting such superior proposal; or
•
(1) certain of the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement have been and continue to be
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, each of
which is capable of being satisfied at the closing) or waived; and (2) Parent and Merger Sub fail to

In the event that the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the merger agreement
will be of no further force or effect without liability of any party (or any direct or indirect equity holder, controlling
person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate, agent or other representative of
such party) to the other parties, as applicable, except certain sections of the merger agreement will survive the
termination of the merger agreement, in each case in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the
previous sentence, nothing in the merger agreement will relieve any party from any liability for fraud or any willful
breach of the merger agreement prior to the termination of the merger agreement. Furthermore, no termination of the
merger agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any party pursuant to the confidentiality agreement, the
limited guaranty, the equity commitment letter or the debt commitment letter, which rights, obligations and agreements
will survive the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with their respective terms.",108,109
"Medallia, Inc._20210914_DEFM14A_19531748_4294624.Pdf",Termination Fees and Remedies,"Termination Fees and Remedies
The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for Medallia and Parent. Upon valid termination of the
merger agreement under specified circumstances, Medallia will be required to pay Parent (or its designee) a
termination fee of $191,110,000. Specifically, this termination fee will be payable by Medallia to Parent if the merger
agreement is terminated:
•
by Parent, if the Medallia Board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger;
•
by Parent, if Medallia breaches or fails to perform, in accordance with the merger agreement, in any material
respects, its obligations under the alternative solicitation provisions in the merger agreement; or
•
by Medallia, if the Medallia Board authorizes the acceptance of a superior proposal.
The termination fee will also be payable in certain circumstances if:
•
the merger agreement is terminated (1) because the merger is not completed by the termination date; (2)
because of Medallia’s failure to obtain the required approval of our stockholders; or (3) subject to a 45-day
cure period, because Medallia breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to not be satisfied;
•
prior to such termination (but after the date of the merger agreement) a proposal, generally speaking, to
acquire at least 50 percent of Medallia’s stock or assets is publicly announced or publicly disclosed by a
third party and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and
•
Medallia subsequently consummates, or enters into a definitive agreement providing for, a transaction
involving the acquisition of at least 50 percent of its stock or assets within one year of such termination.
Notwithstanding the above, under certain circumstances as described in the merger agreement, if Medallia terminates
the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal with a specified party, then the amount of the termination fee
payable to Parent will be $95,550,000.
Upon termination of the merger agreement under other specified circumstances, Parent will be required to pay
Medallia a termination fee of $382,220,000, the payment of which has been guaranteed pursuant to and subject to the
terms and conditions of the limited guaranty. Specifically, the termination fee will be payable by Parent to Medallia if
the merger agreement is terminated:
•
subject to a 45-day cure period, by Medallia, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the
related closing conditions to not be satisfied; or
•
by Medallia, if Parent failed to consummate the merger as required pursuant to, and in the circumstances
specified in, the merger agreement.
In certain instances, Parent can elect to delay the closing of the merger to November 1, 2021. If Parent does so and
does not close the merger after November 1, 2021, then the termination fee payable by Parent will be $445,920,000.
98TABLE OF CONTENTS
The merger agreement also provides that Medallia, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
may specifically enforce the obligations under the merger agreement, except that Medallia may only cause Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the merger, and Parent to cause the equity financing to be funded pursuant to the equity
commitment letter, if certain conditions are satisfied, including the funding or availability of the debt financing.
Neither Parent nor Medallia is required to pay to the other its termination fee on more than one occasion.
Medallia’s receipt of the termination fee payable by Parent to the extent owed (including, without duplication,
Medallia’s right to enforce the limited guaranty with respect thereto and receive certain other amounts under the
merger agreement), and Medallia’s right to specific performance, are the sole and exclusive remedies of Medallia.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, under no circumstances can Medallia receive (1) both a grant of specific
performance or other equitable relief to cause the equity financing to be funded (whether under the merger agreement
or the equity commitment letter) and the occurrence of the closing, on the one hand, and (a) payment of any
monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) whatsoever or (b) payment of
any of the termination fee payable by Parent to Medallia, on the other hand; or (2) both payment of any monetary
damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) whatsoever, on the one hand, and
payment of any of the termination fee payable by Parent to Medallia, on the other hand.

Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
§ 262 Appraisal rights
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand
pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and
who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of
this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of
stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word
“stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include
what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument
issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a
corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a
merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this
title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:
(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the
stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately prior to the execution of the
agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than
2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the
stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the
terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of
this title to accept for such stock anything except:
a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof;
b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of
stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or
consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000
holders;
c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs
(b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or
d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or
fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.
(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 253 or
§ 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available
for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4) [Repealed.]
(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the
provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as
nearly as is practicable.
(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be
submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,
shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such
members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal
rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or
all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1
of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder
electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking
of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares;
provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an
information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will
be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or
consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a
separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or
(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then
either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or
resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation
and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a
nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such
notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation
of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in
writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a
demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing
system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby
to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date
of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or
(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10
days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days
following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title,
later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following
the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to
appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection.
An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to
give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the
facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date
the
B-2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective
date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is
given.
(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or
any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled
to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60
days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand
for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and
(d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to
receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved
pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in §
251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange
in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been
received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder
within 10 days after such stockholder’s request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting
corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d)
of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may,
in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving
or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in
which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached
by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the
petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall
give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving
or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall
also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The
forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne
by the surviving or resulting corporation.
(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section
and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails
to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before
the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which
appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as
to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of
the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3)
the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive
B-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court
shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of
payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount
rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the
merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the
surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest
shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid
and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that
time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the
appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all
proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i)  The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving
or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in
the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates
upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be
enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation
be a corporation of this State or of any state.
(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems
equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the
shares entitled to an appraisal.
(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal
rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive
payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to
stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or
if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the
approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided,
however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to
accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would
have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

Members of the Board:
We understand that Medallia, Inc. (the “Company”), Project Metal Parent, LLC (“Parent”) and Project Metal Merger
Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, (“Merger Sub”) propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated as of July 25, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides,
among other things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger,
the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and each outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares of Company Common
Stock that are, as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, (i) held by the Company as treasury stock,
(ii) owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub or (iii)
held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor consented

Reviewed the Merger Agreement; the debt commitment letters from debt financing sources to the Parent,
substantially in the form of the drafts dated July 25, 2021 (the “Debt Commitment Letters”) and the draft
equity commitment letter from Thoma Bravo Fund XIV, L.P. to the Parent, substantially in the form of the
draft dated July 24, 2021 (the “Equity Commitment Letter” and, together with the Debt Commitment Letters,
the “Commitment Letters”); a guaranty made by Thoma Bravo Fund XIV, L.P. substantially in the form of
the draft dated July 24, 2021; and certain related documents; and
10) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we
have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company and formed a
substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the Financial Projections, we have assumed that they have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
the Company regarding the future financial performance of the Company. We express no view as to such Financial
Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or
delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with
the terms set forth in the Commitment Letters, and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material
respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all
the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no
delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors.
We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the
Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Our opinion does
not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other
alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. We express no opinion with
respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or
employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the Merger. We have not
made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished
with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the
date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Merger and will
receive a fee for our services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the two
years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory and financing services to Thoma Bravo, LLC
(“Thoma Bravo”) (which we understand is the ultimate controlling equity owner of the Parent) and certain of its
affiliates and their affiliated funds’ respective portfolio companies (collectively the “Thoma Bravo Related Entities”),
and, in each case, have received fees in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide
financial advisory and/or financing services to the Company, Parent, Thoma Bravo and the Thoma Bravo Related
Entities in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management
and individual wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading
and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as
providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and
officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance
positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for its own account or the accounts of its

Company and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any

currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition, Morgan
Stanley, its affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with the Company in connection with the
Merger, may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by Thoma
Bravo or the Thoma Bravo Related Entities.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in
accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company
and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this
opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is required to make with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable law. In addition,
Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the stockholders of the Company should vote at
the stockholders’ meeting to be held in connection with the Merger.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock.

accordingly, general words introduced by the word “other” will not be given a restrictive meaning by reason of
the fact that they are preceded by words indicating a particular class of acts, matters or things.
(e) Extent. The phrase “to the extent” means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and does
not simply mean “if.”
(f) Dollars. When used in this Agreement, references to “$” or “Dollars” are references to United States
dollars. All amounts in this Agreement will be paid in Dollars, and if any amounts, costs, fees or expenses
incurred by any Party pursuant to this Agreement are denominated in a currency other than Dollars, to the
extent applicable, the Dollar equivalent for such costs, fees and expenses will be determined by converting such
other currency to Dollars at the foreign exchange rates published by Bloomberg or, if not reported thereby,
another authoritative source reasonably determined by the Company, in effect at the time such amount, cost, fee
or expense is incurred. If the resulting conversion yields a number that extends beyond two decimal points, it
will be rounded to the nearest penny.
(g) Meaning of Terms. The meaning assigned to each capitalized term defined and used in this Agreement is
equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term, and words denoting any gender
include all genders. Where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement, each of its other grammatical forms
has a corresponding meaning. All terms defined in this Agreement will have the defined meanings when used in
any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant to this Agreement unless otherwise defined in
such certificate or document. References to the “United States” or abbreviations thereof mean the United States
of America and its states, territories and possessions.

and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price by (ii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Equity-Based Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the “Vested Company Equity-Based Award Consideration”). The payment of the Vested
Company Equity-Based Award Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes.

to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price by (ii) the total number of

Replacement Company Equity-Based Award Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service with
the Parent and its Representatives through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same
time as the Unvested Company Equity-Based Awards for which such Cash Replacement Equity-Based
Award Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan; provided that, with respect to any Company Equity-Based
Award subject to performance vesting based on the achievement of performance metrics (each a “Company
Performance Award”) that remains outstanding and subject to such performance vesting conditions as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the performance metrics of such Company Performance Award will
be deemed achieved at the applicable level of achievement set forth on Schedule 2.8(a)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and the corresponding Cash Replacement Company Equity-Based Award shall be
subject to such terms and conditions as set forth in Schedule 2.8(a)(ii). Except as provided in the prior
sentence, all Cash Replacement Company Equity-Based Award Amounts will have the same terms and
conditions as applied to the Unvested Company Equity-Based Awards for which they were exchanged,
except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for
such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of
Parent or its Representatives are appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement
Company Equity-Based Award Amounts.
(b) Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as follows:
(i)  Vested Company Options. Each Vested Company Option will be cancelled and converted into and will
become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by

Vested Company Option) by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon

Company Option Consideration”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Vested Company
Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such Vested Company Options is equal to or
greater than the Per Share Price, such Vested Company Options will be cancelled without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof. The payment of the Vested Option Consideration will be subject to

multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such
Unvested Company Option) by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise in full of such Unvested Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cash
Replacement Option Amount”), which Cash Replacement Option Amount will, subject to the holder’s
continued service with the Parent and its Representatives through the applicable vesting dates, vest and
be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option for which such Cash Replacement Option
Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan). All Cash Replacement Option Amounts will have the same terms
and conditions as applied to the award of Unvested Company Options for which they were exchanged,
except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for
such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of
Parent or its Representatives are appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement
Option Amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Unvested Company Options for
which the exercise price per share attributable to such Unvested Company Options is equal to or greater
than the Per Share Price, such Unvested Company Options will be cancelled without any Cash
Replacement Option Amount being paid in respect thereof.
(c) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate (i) Vested Company Equity-Based
Award Consideration owed to all holders of Vested Company Equity-Based Awards; and (ii) Vested Option
Consideration owed to all holders of Vested Company Options. On the Closing Date, the applicable holders of
Vested Company Equity-Based Awards and Vested Company Options will receive a payment from the Company
or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid
to such holders in respect of Vested Company Equity-Based Awards or Vested Company Options that are
cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(b)(i), as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Vested Company Equity-Based Awards or Vested Company
Options pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(b)(i), as applicable, cannot be made through the Company’s
or the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a
check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly
following the Closing Date (but in no event more than two Business Days thereafter).

cancellation of Company Equity-Based Awards and Company Options as of the Effective Time, to provide for
the grant of the Cash Replacement Company Equity-Based Award Amounts and the Cash Replacement Option
Amounts, as applicable, and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the requirements of

holders thereof, all Company Equity-Based Awards and all Company Equity Plans will terminate as of the
Effective Time.

necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger, (A) cause the offering period or purchase period

Time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (D) provide that no further offering
period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP upon or after the date of this Agreement. On
such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each
participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the
Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP and no further rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP
thereafter.",140,142

agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment
Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such
holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency
or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more
than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or

banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the
“Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange
Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is
unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is
at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the
payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any interest or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will
be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.
(i) Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within one Business
Day), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record
(as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and
Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Payment Agent in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such
Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate
(and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as
practicable) an
A-22TABLE OF CONTENTS
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable
withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof). The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The
Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Certificates on the amount
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the
Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an
“agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be
deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message” or such
other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to
receive (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount
in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares by (B) the Per Share Price
(less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof). The Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued
for the benefit of any holder of the Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of
such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a).
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures
with the Payment Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern
time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an
amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting
Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per
Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on
the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first
Business Day after the Closing Date.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other
than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 may be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the
consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares are registered.

(f) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment
Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which
any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed
to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will
be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange
pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.

will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration payable therefor in
accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). The
consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company
Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange
procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.",144,144

discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost,

best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and

(b) Fairness Opinion. The Company Board has received the oral opinion of the Company Financial Advisor,

and other matters considered in connection with the preparation of such opinion, the Per Share Price to be
received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares) pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders (it
being understood and agreed that such opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied
upon by Parent or Merger Sub).

Subsidiaries filed with the Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as
A-28TABLE OF CONTENTS
may be indicated in the notes thereto or as otherwise permitted by Form 10-Q with respect to any financial
statements filed on Form 10-Q); and (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows and stockholders’ equity for the periods then ended. Except as have been described in the Company SEC
Reports, there are no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of the
type required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.
(b) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company has established and maintains, and has at all times
since the Lookback Date maintained, “disclosure controls and procedures” and “internal control over financial
reporting” (in each case as defined pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange
Act). The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all (i) material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes pursuant to the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company’s
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2021, and such assessment concluded that such system was effective. The Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report
concluding that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31,
2021. Since January 31, 2021, and through the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, no

of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021, and conclude, after such assessment, that
such system was effective. Since the Lookback Date, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
of the Company have each made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor
its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received notice from any Governmental Authority
challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications.
(c) Internal Controls. The Company has established and maintains, and at all times since the Lookback Date
has maintained, a system of internal accounting controls that are effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, including policies and procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries
are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of the Company’s management and the
Company Board; and (iii) provide assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Since the Lookback Date,
neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company’s independent registered public
accounting firm has identified or been made aware of (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness (each
as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) in the system of internal control over financial reporting
utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries that has not been subsequently remediated; or (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves the Company’s management or other employees who have a role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and
its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment
letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Reports.

commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until 12:01 a.m. on September 4,

more Acquisition Proposals from any Person or its Representatives, and encourage, facilitate or assist, any

provided in the definition of Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

period commencing with the No-Shop Period Start Date and continuing during the remainder of Pre-Closing
Period, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and directors, and
will instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its other Representatives to, (A) cease and cause
to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room access (or other access to
diligence) of, any Person (other than any Excluded Party, but only for so long as such Person is and remains an

long as such Person is and remains an Excluded Party) to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions
and negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal effective on and from the No-Shop
Period Start Date. Unless the Company has already so requested, promptly following the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the Company will request that each Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) that has executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Transaction promptly return or
destroy, in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement, all non-public information furnished to
such Person by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement. Subject to

directors and executive officers, will not, and the Company will not authorize or direct any of its or its

(other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees), in any such case in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly
encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any
Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to the
making of an Acquisition Proposal (other than only informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this
Section 5.3); (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, an “Alternative
Acquisition Agreement”); or (vi) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing. Following the No-Shop Period
Start Dates, the Company will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision of any
“standstill” or confidentiality agreement to the extent that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a
confidential proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof) if the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(c) Conduct Related to Certain Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Section 5.3, from the
No-Shop Period Start Date until the Company’s receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company
and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their

public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to; (iii) afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to; or (iv) otherwise facilitate the making of a Superior Proposal by, in each case, (A) any
Excluded Party or its Representatives or (B) any Person or its Representatives that has made, renewed or
delivered to the Company a written Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop Period Start Date that was not
solicited in material breach of Section 5.3(b), but only in the case of this Clause (B), if the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after

consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (1) such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take
the actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(c) would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and in
any event within forty eight (48) hours) make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Excluded Party or its Representatives or such Person
or its Representatives that was not previously made available to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the
activities described in Section 5.3(a) with respect to any Excluded Party, including with respect to any amended
proposal or offer submitted by an Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and the restrictions
in Section 5.3(b) will not apply with respect thereto.
(d) No Company Board Recommendation Change or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Except as provided by Section 5.3(e), at no time after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a
committee thereof):
(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent (it being understood
that it shall be considered a modification adverse to Parent that is material if (1) any Acquisition Proposal
structured as a tender or exchange offer is commenced and the Company Board fails to publicly recommend
against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders within 10 Business
Days of commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act; or (2) any Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced (other than by the commencement of a tender or exchange offer) and the
Company Board fails to issue a public press release within 10 Business Days of such public announcement
providing that the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation); (B) adopt, approve or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within 10 Business Days of the occurrence of a material event or development and after Parent so requests
in writing (or, if the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held within 10 Business Days, then
within one Business Day after Parent so requests in writing) (it being understood that the Company will
not be obligated to affirm the Company Board Recommendation pursuant to this Agreement on more than
three occasions); (D) take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation in
connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop,
look and listen” communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d 9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication) (it being understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from
taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the 10th Business
Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal
without such action being considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a
“Company Board Recommendation Change”), it being understood that none of (1) the determination in
itself by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal; (2) the delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of any
notice contemplated by Section 5.3(e); or (3) the public disclosure in itself of the items in clauses (1) and (2)
if required by applicable Law will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or violate this
Section 5.3; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(e) Permissible Company Board Recommendation Change and Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining
the Requisite Stockholder Approval:

Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation

Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so
would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law if and
only if:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three Business Days (the “Event
Notice Period”) in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) so
determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this
Section 5.3(e)(i), which notice will specify the basis for such Company Board Recommendation
Change and will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, during such Event Notice Period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith that the failure to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; (B) taken
into account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents proposed by Parent and other information provided by Parent in response to the notice
described in clause (A) of this Section 5.3(e)(i), in each case, that are offered in writing by Parent, no
later than 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the Event Notice Period, in a manner that would constitute a
binding agreement between the parties if accepted by the Company; (C) permitted Parent and its
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation) and
(D) following such Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s
proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents)
has determined that the failure of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make a Company
Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable Law; it being understood that each time that material modifications to
the Intervening Event occur, Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the time period set
forth in the preceding clause (2) shall recommence and be extended for two Business Days from the
day of such notification; or
(ii) if the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:
(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section
5.3 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three Business Days in
advance (the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A)
received a written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation

additional conditions or other terms that would expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing or any other terms to the Financing in a manner that, in each case, would reasonably be expected

the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the ability
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the

detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing; and (ii) provide the Company with copies of all
executed definitive agreements related to the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
and Merger Sub must give the Company prompt notice (A) of any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or
any event or circumstance that, with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any oral or written notice or communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach (or threatened breach), default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any
provisions of the Financing Letters or such definitive agreements; or (2) dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing and (C), if for
any reason Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent will provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably
practical (but in any event with two Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a written request
therefor to Parent. Parent will (and will cause the Financing Sources and the Guarantor to) provide the Company
and its Representatives with such access to Parent, the Financing Sources and the Guarantor as the Company
and its Representatives may reasonably request for the purpose of allowing the Company and its
Representatives to understand the status of Parent’s efforts to arrange the Financing.
(d) Alternate Debt Financing. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, if any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the “flex” provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, then Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) alternative financing from the same
or alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and
Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters and in an amount at least
equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the “Alternate Debt
Financing”); and (ii) one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt
Financing (the “New Debt Commitment Letters”), in each case, or other terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in part.
Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection
therewith, which may be delivered with the fee amounts and “flex” terms redacted in a customary manner so
long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or
termination of the Alternate Debt Financing) to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment
Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing Letters,” “Fee Letters” or the “Debt
Commitment Letters” will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters and Fee Letters, as applicable, to
the extent not superseded by a New

Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters or Fee Letters, as
applicable, to the extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing” or the “Debt
Financing” will mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters as
modified pursuant to the foregoing.

any definitive agreement or distribute any cash; (iii) give any indemnities in connection with the Debt Financing

action that, in the good faith determination of the Company, (a) would interfere with the conduct of the business

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In addition, (A) no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of its

Financing will contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require (1) any Representative of the Company or any

reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such Representative; (2) the Company Board to approve

and its Subsidiaries to provide any information (a) the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under

or other privilege applicable to such information; or (ii) violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third
Person the right to terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, any Contract to which the Company or any of

Company of any alleged failure to comply, or action or failure to act which could be believed to be a breach of
Section 6.6(a); (B) Parent includes in such Non-Cooperation Notice reasonable detail regarding the cooperation

Company’s breach, if any, of its obligations under Section 6.6(a) caused the failure of the Debt Financing to be
obtained.
(c) Use of Logos. The Company consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries’ logos in connection with the
Financing so long as such logos are used (i) solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (ii) solely in connection with a description of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their business and
products or the Merger; and (iii) in a manner consistent with the other terms and conditions that the Company

penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with their cooperation in
arranging the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the provision of information utilized in connection
therewith, except with respect to any losses suffered or incurred as a result of (i) the bad faith, gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Representatives or (ii) material breach by the Company or its
Subsidiaries of this Section 6.6. Parent’s obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(e) and this Section 6.6(f) are referred
to collectively as the “Reimbursement Obligations.”
(g) No Financing Condition. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the
Financing is not a condition to the Closing. Subject to Section 9.10(b)(ii), if the Financing has not been obtained,
Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company will have the
option of having an appropriate senior officer of the Company provide any solvency certificate required or
requested to be provided by any of the Financing Sources in connection with the Closing or otherwise.

Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties,

restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law
requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product

reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and

fact that it is withholding such information or documents, and use commercially reasonably efforts to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. Nothing in this Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk

of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures, health and
safety measures, and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform any “invasive” testing or soil,

(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to), for a period of six years after the Effective Time, honor and fulfill,
in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements
between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former
directors, officers or employees (and any person who becomes a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”)
set forth on Section 6.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter or that use the same form in all material respects as
the form of indemnification agreement filed with the SEC Reports. In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates
of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries
of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period or such period in
which an Indemnified Person is asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.10(b), whichever is
longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except as required by applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.10(a), during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent provided in the applicable organizational document or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries’ in effect as of the date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person from
and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any
Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal
Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions
taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger (including any disposition of assets of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the connection with of such
Legal Proceeding of the type contemplated by this Section 6.10(b), (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the
right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time; and (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to
retain his or her own counsel (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving
A-60TABLE OF CONTENTS
Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal
Proceeding; (C) to the extent that an Indemnified Person has such right as of the date of this Agreement and
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay any amount if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the Surviving Corporation will
advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified
Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such
Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to
monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek
the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person
pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or
complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of
which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.
(c) D&O Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid “tail” policy (the “Tail
Policy”) with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for the Tail Policy
does not exceed 300 percent of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year, it being
understood that if the aggregate cost would exceed that limit, the Company shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable up to such limit. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder
for so long as the Tail Policy is in full force and effect.
(d) Successors and Assigns. Proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10 if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person.
(e) No Impairment; Third Person Beneficiary Rights. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any
other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or
the Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of
the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries
pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10,
with full rights of enforcement. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons (and his or her heirs
and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to this
Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
or (iv) applicable Law.
(f) Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.10 are joint and several.
(g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair
any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or

(a) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans made available to Parent in
accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation
from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in
accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.
(b) Employment; Benefits. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all Continuing Employees. For
the one-year period beginning on the Effective Time, or, if earlier, until the date of termination of the Continuing
Employee (“Benefits Period”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the
Company Benefit Plans (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based incentive compensation,
defined benefit pension, retiree or post-employment welfare or nonqualified deferred compensation (“Excluded
Benefits”)) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Company Plans”) that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement; (ii)
provide other compensation and benefits (other than Excluded Benefits) to each Continuing Employee that,
taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than the
Excluded Benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Comparable
Plans”); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable Plans such that each Continuing
Employee receives compensation and benefits (other than Excluded Benefits) that, taken as a whole, are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than Excluded Benefits) provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, base compensation and
target annual or shorter term cash incentive compensation opportunities will not be decreased during the
Benefits Period for any Continuing Employee employed during that period. During the Benefits Period, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide to Continuing
Employees severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement under the Company Benefit Plans listed on Section 3.18(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter that are designated as severance plans.
(c) New Plans. Except as otherwise required by applicable Laws at or after the Effective Time, Parent will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent to, cause to be granted to the Continuing
Employees credit for service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting in 401(k) or similar retirement benefits and entitlement to benefits where length of service
is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but not including for any
purpose under a defined benefit pension plan or equity or equity-based compensation or benefit plan) to the
same extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited to such Continuing Employee under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Date, except that such service need not be credited to
the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws, Parent shall take commercially
reasonable actions to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting period, in any employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company Plans) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces
coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee, all waiting
periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her
A-62TABLE OF CONTENTS
covered dependents to the same extent waived under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan; (iii) any eligible
expenses paid by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying the corresponding
deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan to the same extent credited under the corresponding Company
Benefit Plan for such purpose; and (iv) the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan
that is a flexible spending plan to be credited with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing

(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the
Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be responsible for
all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.9(e), Parent will pay or cause to be
paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other
similar Taxes or fees, in each case arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger.
(b) Company Payments.
(i) Future Transactions. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c) at a time
when the requisite stockholder approval has not been obtained, 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e); (B) at the time of
such termination, the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c) have been satisfied or are
capable of being satisfied and the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) would be
satisfied if the date of such termination was the Closing Date; (C) following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or
Section 8.1(e), an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed and not
withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (D) within one year of the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an
Acquisition Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated at any time, then
the Company will, concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, pay or cause to
be paid to Parent or its designee an
A-69TABLE OF CONTENTS
amount equal to the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time). For
purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to “15 percent” in the definition of “Acquisition
Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50 percent.”
(ii) Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then the Company must, within two Business Days following such termination, pay or cause
to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to
time).
(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the
Company must, concurrently with such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the
Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time).
(c) Parent Payment. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i), then
Parent must, within two Business Days following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company or
its designee an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated in Schedule 8.3(c) (which Schedule may be updated by the Company from time to time).
(d) Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the
Company or Parent, as applicable, be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the
same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
(i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation; and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and when required to be paid
pursuant to this Section 8.3 will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate the Party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.
(e) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the Merger and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or
Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a
judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment
against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(c) or any portion thereof, as applicable, then the non-
paying party will pay or cause to be paid to the other party the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) of the other party in connection with such
Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the prime
rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was
required to be made) plus five percent through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually
received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (collectively, “Enforcement
Expenses”).
(f) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.
(i) For the Company Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the
Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (including,
without duplication, the Company’s right to enforce the Guaranty with respect thereto and receive the
Parent Termination Fee from Guarantor), the Reimbursement Obligations, the Enforcement
A-70
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Expenses and the Company’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10 will be the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties in respect of this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any
claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Upon
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, the Enforcement Expenses and the Reimbursement Obligations,
none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of the Company
Related Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or for any
matters forming the basis of such termination, except that the Parties or their respective Affiliates (or both)
will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies
with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.2, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(e), as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(i) will not relieve Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor from
any liability for any (1) actual or intentional common law fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement (which
liability the Parties acknowledge and agree (i) may not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-
pocket costs; and (ii) will be determined in the discretion of the Chosen Court); or (2) breaches of the
Confidentiality Agreement, except, in each case, that under no circumstances will the collective monetary
damages payable by the Parent Related Parties (including for any Willful Breach (but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, for actual and intentional common law fraud)) under this Agreement (taking into
account the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement), the Guaranty or the
Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount, in the aggregate, equal to the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee plus the Enforcement Expenses plus the Reimbursement Obligations (such aggregate
amount, the “Parent Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or
obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek
or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation (except for actual and
intentional common law fraud) against the Parent Related Parties, and, other than with respect to actual and
intentional common law fraud, in no event will the Company be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary
damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Parent
Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Guaranty, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or
any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Nothing
in this Section 8.3(f)(i) will preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub under the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing or limit the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to
any Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. Other than
Guarantor’s obligations under the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will
any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have any
liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Merger.
(ii) For the Parent Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b), the
Enforcement Expenses and Parent’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10 will be the sole
and exclusive remedies of the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties in respect of this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or any
claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Upon
payment of the Company Termination Fee and the Enforcement Expenses, none of the Company Related
Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of the Parent Related Parties or any other Person
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or for any matters forming the basis of such termination.
Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b)) will be the
only monetary damages that any Parent Related Party may recover from the Company Related Parties in
respect of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Transaction Documents, the

termination of this Agreement, or the failure to consummate the Merger, and upon payment of such
amount, (A) none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any Parent
Related Party or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or any matters forming
the basis of such termination (except that the Parties or their respective Affiliates (or both) will remain
obligated with respect to, and Parent may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality
Agreement, Section 8.2, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(e), as applicable); and (B) no Parent Related Party or
any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding against any Company Related
Party arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any matters forming the basis for such
termination (except that the Parties or their respective Affiliates (or both) will remain obligated with respect
to, and Parent may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.2,
Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(e), as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(ii) will
not relieve the Company from any liability for any (1) actual and intentional common law fraud or Willful
Breach of this Agreement (which liability the Parties acknowledge and agree (i) may not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs; and (ii) will be determined in the discretion of the
Chosen Court) or (2) any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement, except, in each case, that under no
circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Company for breaches (including any
Willful Breach (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, for actual and intentional common law fraud))
under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this
Agreement) exceed an amount, in the aggregate,equal to the amount of the Company Termination Fee plus
the Reimbursement Obligations (such aggregate amount, the “Company Liability Limitation”). In no event
will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any
other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the
Company Liability Limitation (except for actual and intentional common law fraud) against the Company
Related Parties, and, other than with respect to actual and intentional common law fraud, in no event will
Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against
the Company Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Merger, the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising
out of any such breach, termination or failure. Other than the obligations of the Company provided in this
Agreement, no Company Related Party or any Person other than the Company has any liability for
monetary damages to any Parent Related Party or any other Person relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Merger.
(g) Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Parties will each be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 9.10(b), except that, although the Company, in its
sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies under this Agreement, including by pursuing specific
performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section 9.10(b), under no circumstances will
the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type
contemplated by Section 9.10(b) and any monetary damages.

(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this
Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Transaction Document or
otherwise, although the Company may, subject in all respects to Section 8.2, Section 8.3, this Section 9.10 and
Section 9.16 (and, in each case, the limitations set forth herein or therein), pursue both (i) a grant of specific
performance, and (ii) payment of monetary damages pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or the Parent Termination Fee, if,
as and when required pursuant to Section 8.3(c), under no circumstances will the Company, directly or indirectly,
be permitted or entitled to receive (A) both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) and the
occurrence of the Closing, on the one hand, and (1) payment of any monetary damages (including any monetary
damages in lieu of specific performance) whatsoever or (2) payment of any of the Parent Termination Fee and the
amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to Section 8.3(f)(i) or the Reimbursement Obligations, on the other

performance) whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of any of the Parent Termination Fee and the amounts,

(b) Specific Performance.
(i) Irreparable Damage. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions that are required of it by this
Agreement in order to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms of this Agreement (including specific performance or other equitable relief to cause Parent to
perform any obligations required of it to enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter); (B) the
provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one
hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement.

be funded, including by exercising its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and that such obligation
of Parent, and the right of the Company to specific performance in connection with enforcing such
obligation of Parent (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter), and the obligation of
Parent to consummate the Merger, will be subject only to the requirements that (A) all of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been and continue to be satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the
Closing) or waived; (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or is reasonably expected to be funded in full
