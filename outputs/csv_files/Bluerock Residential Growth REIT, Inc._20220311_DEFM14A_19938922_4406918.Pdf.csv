Bluerock Homes Trust, Inc. (“Bluerock Homes”) was formed as a Maryland corporation and wholly owned

distribution to holders of Common Stock of the outstanding shares of Bluerock Homes common stock (the
“distribution”). Bluerock Homes will be an externally managed, publicly traded REIT following the
distribution. The headquarters of Bluerock Homes will be located in New York, New York, at 1345 Avenue of

The Proposals
The special meeting of our stockholders (the “special meeting”) will be held online as a virtual meeting on
April 12, 2022, at 11:00 a.m., New York time. At the special meeting, holders of our Class A Common Stock,
$0.01 par value per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and our Class C Common Stock, $0.01 par value per
share (the “Class C Common Stock” and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”), as
of the record date, which was the close of business on March 7, 2022, will be asked to consider and vote on
(1) a proposal to approve the merger (the “proposal to approve the merger”), (2) a proposal to approve, on a
non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the “proposal to approve the merger-related
compensation”) and (3) a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger (the
“proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting”).
Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the Notice
of Special Meeting may be brought before the special meeting.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
All stockholders of record of shares of our Common Stock as of the record date, which was the close of
business on March 7, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the special meeting or any
postponement or adjournment of the special meeting. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote on
each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class A Common Stock that such holder
owned as of the record date, and will be entitled to cast 50 votes on each matter presented at the special
meeting for each share of Class C Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the
record date, there were 29,260,629 shares of Class A Common Stock and 76,603 shares of Class C Common
Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
2 TABLE OF CONTENTS
The presence virtually via the special meeting website or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to
cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes
of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will
be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not
present at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later date. Pursuant
to our bylaws, the board of directors may adjourn the meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, and
reconvene as the board may determine (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, including that
in certain circumstances the special meeting may not be held, without Parent’s consent, on a date that is
more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).
Required Vote
Completion of the merger requires approval of the merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of the issued
and outstanding Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger.
Each stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each
share of Class A Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date, and will be entitled to cast 50
votes on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class C Common Stock that such
holder owned as of the record date. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of
votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to
vote by proxy or at the special meeting via the special meeting website (including by abstaining), or fail to
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting
against the proposal to approve the merger.
Each of the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and the proposal to approve adjournment
of the meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal. Approval of
these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if
you fail to vote by proxy or at the special meeting via the special meeting website, or fail to instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals.
Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of these
proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
The vote of the holders of our Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series B
Preferred Stock”), 7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series
C Preferred Stock”), 7.125% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series D
Preferred Stock”), and Series T Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series T Preferred
Stock”), which we refer to collectively as “Preferred Stock,” is not required to approve any of the proposals
at the special meeting and is not being solicited.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of
approximately 818,724 shares of our Class A Common Stock and approximately 72,964 shares of our Class C
Common Stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 13.50% of the voting power of our Common Stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting, in each case including excess shares (as defined below). Our directors
and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares of Common Stock that they own
in favor of the proposal to approve the merger, in favor of the proposal to approve the merger-related
compensation and in favor of the proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting. Under the Stockholders
Agreement, dated October 31, 2017 among the Company and the stockholders party thereto (the
“stockholders agreement”), if at any meeting of stockholders the holders of Class C Common Stock own
shares of Class C Common Stock representing more than 9.9% of the voting rights of the then-outstanding
Common Stock (such shares, the “excess shares”), then such holders shall vote such excess shares as
directed by the board of directors. Under the merger agreement, unless the board of directors effects a
company adverse recommendation change, any excess shares must be voted in favor of the approval of the
merger. In addition, R. Ramin Kamfar, James G. Babb III, Ryan S. MacDonald, Jordan B. Ruddy, Michael L.
Konig (who are members of our management) and certain of their affiliated entities, solely in their capacity as
stockholders of the Company and limited partners of Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership and the Company’s operating partnership (the “operating partnership” or “Bluerock Residential
Holdings”), have entered into support agreements requiring, among other things, such persons to vote their
shares of Common Stock, other than any excess shares, in favor of the proposal to

Common Stock
At the merger effective time, each share of our Common Stock (other than shares of our Common Stock that
are owned by Parent or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or us, which will automatically be cancelled
with no consideration being delivered in exchange thereof (the “cancelled shares”)) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the merger effective time will be automatically converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration. If we declare a dividend reasonably determined by us to be required to maintain our
status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid or reduce the payment of income or excise tax or any other
entity-level tax as permitted under the merger agreement, the merger consideration will be decreased by an
amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend.
Preferred Stock
After the date this proxy statement is mailed to our stockholders, we will deliver to the stockholders of
record of our Preferred Stock a notice of redemption for each applicable series of Preferred Stock that
complies in all material respects with the specifications and timing requirements of our organizational
documents. The notice of redemption will state that the redemption of our Preferred Stock will be effective as
of, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the merger effective time. The redemption notices will be
prepared by us and be reasonably acceptable to Parent.
At or prior to the merger effective time, Parent, on behalf of the surviving company, will irrevocably set aside
and deposit in trust for the benefit of the holders of our Preferred Stock cash equal to (i) $25.00, plus an
amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the redemption date, without interest, per
share of Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series T Preferred Stock, and (ii) $1,000.00,
plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the redemption date, without
interest, per share of Series B Preferred Stock (such amount, collectively, the “Preferred Stock redemption
amount”). We and Parent will give irrevocable instructions, effective as of the merger effective time, for the
payment of the Preferred Stock redemption amount.
Company Warrants
At least ten (10) business days prior to the merger effective time, we will notify the warrant agent in
accordance with the warrant agreements (the “warrant agreements”) that govern warrants to purchase our
Class A Common Stock (the “Company Warrants”) that, as of the merger effective time, each share of our
Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than the
cancelled shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the merger consideration and that
the terms of the warrant agreements will be adjusted so that the holder of any Company Warrant exercised
after the merger effective time will be entitled to receive in cash the merger consideration that the holder
would have received if the Company Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the closing date.

In connection with the closing of the merger, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $800 million to
be paid to the holders of our Common Stock (assuming the cash exercise of all outstanding Company
Warrants), including holders of Company equity awards. As described under “The Merger Agreement - 
Treatment of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company Warrants and Equity Awards,” Parent will also cause
approximately $1.19 billion to be paid to the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
Series D Preferred Stock and Series T Preferred Stock, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to
and including the closing date. In addition, Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the
merger, Parent expects to cause the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities to be
prepaid in full and our mortgage loans will be repaid or remain outstanding. As of December 31, 2021,
nothing was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and we had approximately $1.37 billion in
mortgage loans outstanding.
Parent has informed us that it is currently in the process of obtaining debt financing to be provided in
connection with the merger. In addition, it is expected that Blackstone will contribute equity to Parent for the
purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such
debt financing.
Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained
from the debt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of
our existing debt, paying carrying costs with respect to the properties, funding working capital requirements,
and for other costs and expenses related to the financing and the merger. Parent has informed us that it
currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the debt financing would be secured by, among other
things, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or ground leased by us, the direct
and/or indirect equity interests in certain entities which own certain properties, certain escrows and reserves
and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the
applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the merger being completed and
other customary conditions for similar financings.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, we have agreed to deliver, or we have agreed to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any joint venture to deliver, promptly following Parent’s request, a notice
prepared by Parent, in form and substance reasonably approved by us, to each of the lenders under our
existing mortgage indebtedness requesting that such lender consent to, among other things, the
consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to certain
modifications of the existing loan documents reasonably requested by Parent. Pursuant to the merger
agreement, we have also agreed to deliver customary prepayment and/or defeasance notices to the extent
requested by Parent.
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of
the merger. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement - Financing Cooperation” and “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to the Merger.”",15,15

restrictions on our ability to solicit any company takeover proposals (as defined in “The Merger
Agreement - Company Stockholders’ Meeting”), including, among others, restrictions on our ability to
furnish to any other person any information in connection with any company takeover proposal or engage in
any discussions or negotiations regarding any company takeover proposal. Subject to the terms of the
merger agreement, we or our subsidiaries may furnish information with respect to us or our subsidiaries to,

Agreement - Obligation of the Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation,” and our board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside

Termination by Either the Company or Parent
In addition, we, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, may terminate and abandon the merger
agreement by mutual written notice at any time prior to the closing date, in certain cases even after we have
obtained the requisite vote of holders of our Common Stock to approve the merger, if:
the merger has not been consummated by September 20, 2022 (as it may be extended, the “outside
date”), provided that, if the closing has not occurred by the outside date because the closing
conditions relating to the Bluerock Homes registration statement and the consummation of the
separation and the distribution were neither satisfied nor waived but all other conditions have been
satisfied or waived (other than those that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but which
conditions are capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur on such date), then either we or
Parent may, by written notice on or before the second business date prior to the then-current outside
date, extend the outside date by one month; provided that the outside date may, subject to certain
restrictions, only be extended by us until the one-month anniversary of September 20, 2022, and
Parent may not extend the outside date beyond the three-month anniversary of September 20, 2022;
provided, further, that the right to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this bullet point will
not be available to a party if the failure to consummate the merger by the outside date is due to a
breach by such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth in the
merger agreement;
any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued an order permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the separation, distribution or merger and
such order has become final and nonappealable; provided that the right to terminate the merger
agreement pursuant to this bullet point will not be available to a party if such order is due to the
breach by such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth in the
merger agreement; or
the requisite vote of holders of our Common Stock to approve the merger has not been obtained at
the special meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed) at which the approval of the merger is
voted upon and such vote has concluded.
Termination by the Company
We may also terminate and abandon the merger agreement by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the

payment obligations with respect to the parent termination fee and certain expense reimbursement and
indemnification obligations of Parent under the merger agreement, subject to the terms and limitations set
forth in the guaranty.
The maximum aggregate liability of the Guarantor under the guaranty will not exceed the sum of (1) $200
million, (2) interest on any overdue portion of the parent termination fee as described in the merger
agreement and (3) all reasonable and documented third-party costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable fees of counsel) actually incurred by us relating to any litigation or other proceeding brought by
us to enforce our rights under the guaranty, if we prevail in such litigation or proceeding.
We cannot seek specific performance to require Parent or Merger Sub to complete the merger and, subject to
limited exceptions, including with respect to enforcing confidentiality provisions and certain expense
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent, our sole and exclusive remedy against Parent
relating to any breach of the merger agreement or otherwise will be the right to receive the parent termination

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the merger, taken together with the
distribution, is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation of the Company and
12 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined
below) of shares of Common Stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of (A) the amount of cash received with
respect to such U.S. holder’s shares of Common Stock in the merger plus (B) the fair market value,
determined when the distribution occurs, of the shares of Bluerock Homes common stock received in the
distribution, and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Common Stock. The U.S. federal
income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder (as defined below) of the distribution and the merger will
depend on various factors, including whether the receipt of such distributions and payments are treated as
distributions from the Company that are attributable to gain from the sale of “United States real property
interests”  (“USRPIs”) pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980
(“FIRPTA”). See “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences - Consequences of the
Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock” for further discussion of the material U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the distribution and the merger to non-U.S. holders. You should consult your
own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the merger in light of your particular
circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws).

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special
meeting and the proposed merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be
important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in
this proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by
reference, including the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit
A.
What is the proposed transaction?
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by affiliates of Blackstone pursuant to the
merger agreement. After the merger has been approved by our common stockholders and the other
closing conditions under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, the Company will merge
with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company. The merger will occur
at the time provided in the merger agreement.
The Company has agreed that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the separation of certain of the
Company’s single-family properties and other assets (collectively, the “Bluerock Homes Business”)
from the remainder of our business and the distribution of Bluerock Homes common stock to our
common stockholders. After the distribution is completed, Bluerock Homes will be a separate, externally
managed, publicly traded REIT that will own and operate Bluerock Residential’s single-family properties.
The separation and the distribution will be carried out in accordance with the terms of the separation
principles. The completion of the separation and the distribution is a condition to the merger under the
merger agreement.
For additional information about the merger, please review the merger agreement, including the
separation principles, attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it
is the principal document governing the merger.
As a common stockholder, what will I receive in the merger?
For each outstanding share of Common Stock that you own immediately prior to the merger effective
time, you will receive the merger consideration, which is $24.25 in cash, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes. The merger consideration is in addition to the shares of Bluerock Homes
common stock that our stockholders of record as of the record date for the distribution will be entitled
to receive in the distribution.
Will the shares of Bluerock Homes be publicly traded on an exchange?
Immediately following the distribution, Bluerock Homes will be a publicly traded REIT. It will be a
condition to the distribution that the Bluerock Homes common stock that will be distributed in the
distribution has been approved for listing on the NYSE American, subject to official notice of
distribution, prior to the consummation of the distribution. Bluerock Homes expects that its common
stock will be traded on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol “BHM.”
Will I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the shares of Common Stock that I own?
On December 10, 2021, our board of directors authorized and we declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.1625 per share of Common Stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, which was paid in cash on
January 5, 2022, to holders of record of our Common Stock at the close of business on December 23,
2021. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we may make, declare and pay regular quarterly cash
dividends on Common Stock for the fiscal quarters ending March 30, 2022, and June 30, 2022, in
amounts up to $0.1625 per share per quarter (with record and payment dates consistent with historical
record and payments dates for fiscal year 2021). Under the terms of the merger agreement, we may not
authorize, declare or pay any other dividends to the holders of shares of Common Stock for fiscal
quarters ending after June 30, 2022, without the prior written consent of Parent, other than dividends
reasonably determined to be required to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
payment of income or excise tax or any other entity-level tax (with any such additional required dividend
resulting in a corresponding decrease to the merger consideration).
What will happen to my outstanding warrants in the merger?
The outstanding Company Warrants to purchase Common Stock will remain outstanding following the
merger effective time in accordance with their terms, but the terms of the warrant agreements with
respect to the Company Warrants will be adjusted so that the holder of any Company Warrant exercised
after the merger effective time will be entitled to receive in cash the amount of the merger consideration
that, if the Company Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the merger effective time, such
holder would have been entitled to receive upon the consummation of the merger.
What will happen to the Company’s Dividend Reinvestment Plans (“DRIPs”) in the merger?
On December 19, 2021, the board of directors approved the suspension of the DRIPs with respect to our
Class A Common Stock and Series T Preferred Stock until further notice, as required pursuant to the
merger agreement. Prior to the merger effective time, pursuant to the merger agreement, the board of
directors will adopt resolutions or take other actions required to terminate the DRIPs effective prior to,
but subject to the occurrence of, the merger effective time.
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
If our common stockholders vote to approve the merger, and assuming that the other conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived, it is currently anticipated that the merger will be completed in the second
quarter of 2022. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the merger will take place on the third
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger described under “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to the Merger”  (other than (1) those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, and
(2) the consummation of the separation and the distribution, but subject to the consummation of the
separation and the distribution prior to the merger effective time) or on such other date as may be
mutually agreed in writing by us and Parent. For further information regarding the timing of the closing
of the merger, see “The Merger Agreement - Effective Time; Closing Date.”
What happens if the merger is not completed?
If the merger is not approved by our common stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, our common stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, Bluerock Residential will remain a public company and
shares of Common Stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE
American. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, we will be required
to pay Parent the company termination fee. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay
us the parent termination fee upon termination of the merger agreement.
If the merger is completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares of Common Stock?
Following the completion of the merger, your shares of Common Stock will automatically be converted
into the right to receive your portion of the merger consideration. Shortly after the merger is completed,
you will receive instructions describing how you may surrender your shares of Common Stock for the
merger consideration. If your shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or
other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action,
if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the merger
consideration.
When and where is the special meeting?
The special meeting will be held on April 12, 2022, at 11:00 a.m., New York time. The special meeting will
be held solely via live webcast, and there will not be a physical meeting location, given the current
public health impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and our desire to promote the health and safety of our
stockholders, as well as our directors, officers, employees and other constituents.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Who can vote and attend the special meeting?
All holders of record of shares of Common Stock as of the record date, which was the close of business
on March 7, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the special meeting or any
postponement or adjournment of the special meeting. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote
on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class A Common Stock that such
holder owned as of the record date, and will be entitled to cast 50 votes on each matter presented at the
special meeting for each share of Class C Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date.
The vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock is not required to approve any of the proposals at
the special meeting and is not being solicited.
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the merger?
Approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of issued and outstanding Common
Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger. Because the required
vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast
rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including failure
to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same
effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger.
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation
that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger?
Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable
to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure
to vote your shares of Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank
or other nominee) and abstentions will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve adjournments of the special meeting?
Approval of any adjournment of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure to vote your shares of
Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and
abstentions will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
Why is my vote important?
If you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote at the special meeting via the special
meeting website, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special
meeting. In addition, because the proposal to approve the merger must be approved by the affirmative
vote of the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger by
the holders of issued and outstanding Common Stock, your failure to authorize your proxy or voting
instructions or to vote at the special meeting via the special meeting website will have the same effect as
a vote “AGAINST” the approval of the merger.
Will I also vote on any proposals to approve the separation and the distribution?
No. No vote of Company stockholders is required to approve the separation and the distribution.
How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of the Company’s shares of Common Stock?
The merger consideration of $24.25 per share in cash (without taking into account the value of the
shares of Bluerock Homes to be received by holders of Common Stock in the distribution) represents a
premium of approximately 124% to the unaffected closing price of $10.85 on September 15, 2021, the last
trading day prior to Bloomberg’s report, on September 16, 2021, that the Company was evaluating
strategic alternatives.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
How does our board of directors recommend that I vote?
Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger, “FOR” the
proposal to approve the merger-related compensation, and “FOR” the proposal to approve adjournment
of the meeting.
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related
compensation payable to our named executive officers?
The SEC has adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve
certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based
on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the merger.
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related
compensation?
The proposal to approve the merger-related compensation is a proposal separate and apart from the
proposal to approve the merger. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the
merger. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our board of
directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject
to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is
completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, in accordance with the
terms and conditions applicable to such compensation.
Do any of the Company’s directors and executive officers have any interests in the merger that are different
than mine?
Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. See “The Merger - Interests of Our Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger” for additional information about interests that our directors and
executive officers have in the merger that are different than yours.
What do I need to do now?
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the
exhibits attached to this proxy statement, please vote your shares of Common Stock or authorize a proxy
to vote your shares of Common Stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. You will
be entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class A
Common Stock that you owned as of the record date, and you will be entitled to cast 50 votes on each
matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class C Common Stock that you owned as of
the record date.
How do I cast my vote?
If you are a holder of record of Common Stock on the record date, you may vote at the special meeting
via the special meeting website or authorize a proxy to vote your shares of Common Stock at the special
meeting. You can authorize your proxy by marking, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy
card by mail, or, if you prefer, by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions
included with your proxy card. Specific instructions to be followed by stockholders of record interested
in authorizing a proxy via the Internet or by telephone are shown on the accompanying proxy card.
Internet and telephone procedures are designed to authenticate the stockholder’s identity and to allow
stockholders to authorize a proxyholder to vote the stockholder’s shares and confirm that their
instructions have been properly recorded. A stockholder that authorizes a vote through the Internet
should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges
from Internet access providers and telephone companies, which will be borne by the stockholder.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
How do I cast my vote if my shares of Common Stock are held of record in a “street name”?
If your shares are held in a “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must direct your
intermediary regarding how you would like your shares voted by following the voting instructions you
receive from your broker, bank or other nominee; or, if you want to participate in the special meeting,
you must follow the instructions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee.
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?
With respect to the proposal to approve the merger, if you abstain from voting and fail to cast your vote
at the special meeting via the special meeting website or by proxy, or if you hold your shares of
Common Stock in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other
nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger. With respect to the proposal to
approve the merger-related compensation and the proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting, if
you abstain from voting and you fail to cast your vote at the special meeting via the special meeting
website or by proxy, or if you hold your shares of Common Stock in “street name” and fail to give
voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of
such proposals.
How will proxy holders vote my shares of Common Stock?
If you properly authorize a proxy prior to the special meeting, your shares of Common Stock will be
voted as you direct. If you authorize a proxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares of
Common Stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger, “FOR” the proposal to approve
the merger-related compensation and “FOR” the proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting.
Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the
Notice of Special Meeting may be brought before the special meeting.
What happens if I sell shares of Common Stock before the special meeting?
If you held shares of Common Stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective
time, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but not the right to receive the merger
consideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when the merger becomes
effective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares of Common Stock you previously
owned.
Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?
Yes. If you own shares of Common Stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a
previously authorized proxy at any time before it is exercised by filing with our Secretary a notice of
revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending the meeting and voting via the
special meeting website. Attendance at the meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a
previously authorized proxy. If you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares
of Common Stock, the foregoing options for changing your vote do not apply, and instead you must
follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.
Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?
Yes. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the merger, taken together
with the distribution, is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation of the Company
and will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of
shares of Common Stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of (A) the amount of cash received with
respect to such U.S. holder’s shares of Common Stock in the merger plus (B) the fair market value,
determined when the distribution occurs, of the shares of Bluerock Homes common stock received in
the distribution, and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Common Stock. The U.S.
federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of the distribution and the merger will depend on
various factors, including whether the receipt of such distributions and payments are treated as
distributions from the Company that are attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs pursuant to the
provisions of FIRPTA. See “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences -

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock” for further discussion of
the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution and the merger to non-U.S.
holders. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of
the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state,
local or foreign income and other tax laws). For further discussion, see “The Merger - Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences.”
What rights do I have if I oppose the merger?
If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the proposal to
approve the merger. You are not, however, entitled to exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or
the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in connection
with the merger because, as permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter provides
that stockholders are not entitled to exercise any such rights unless our board of directors, upon the
affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors, determines that such rights apply. Our board of
directors has made no such determination. See “No Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal.”
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a
Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that
we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov when filed.
Have any stockholders entered into a support agreement in connection with the merger?
Yes. Certain holders of Common Stock (R. Ramin Kamfar, James G. Babb III, Ryan S. MacDonald, Jordan
B. Ruddy, Michael L. Konig (who are members of our management) and certain of their affiliated
entities), solely in their capacity as our stockholders and limited partners of our operating partnership,
have entered into support agreements with Parent pursuant to which the holders agreed, among other
things, (i) to vote their respective covered shares other than any excess shares, in favor of the approval
of the merger, (ii) to vote their respective covered shares, other than any excess shares, against any
company takeover proposal and any other action that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, delay, materially delay, materially postpone or adversely affect the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or result in a breach in any material respect of any of the
covenants, representations or warranties or other obligations or agreements of us under the merger
agreement, of us or Bluerock Homes under the separation documentation or of such holder under the
applicable support agreement, and (iii) not to transfer their respective covered shares, in each case,
subject to certain exceptions.
As of the record date, the covered shares represented approximately 11.69% of the outstanding voting
power of our Common Stock after giving effect to the voting provisions relating to “Excess Shares”  (as
defined in the stockholders agreement). Under the stockholders agreement, if at any meeting of
stockholders the holders of Class C Common Stock own shares of Class C Common Stock representing
more than 9.9% of the voting rights of the then-outstanding Common Stock (such shares, the “excess
shares”), then such holders shall vote such excess shares as directed by the board of directors. Under
the merger agreement, unless the board of directors effects a company adverse recommendation change,
any excess shares (which represented approximately 1.67% of the outstanding voting power of our
Common Stock as of the record date) must be voted in favor of the approval of the merger. The support
agreements automatically terminate upon the earlier of (i) the merger effective time and (ii) the
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. See “The Merger Agreement - Support
Agreements.”
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?
If you are unable to attend the meeting via the special meeting website, we encourage you to complete,
sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or
through the Internet.

PROPOSAL 1
PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE MERGER
We are asking our common stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve the merger of Bluerock Residential
Growth REIT, Inc. with and into Merger Sub.
For detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the merger and the merger
agreement throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections entitled “The
Merger” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy
statement.
Approval of the proposal to approve the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of issued and
outstanding Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger. If you
properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote
your shares of Common Stock “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 1, your shares of Common
Stock, will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors, which is “FOR” this Proposal 1.
Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are
entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares of Common Stock
(including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will
have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger.
Approval of this proposal is a condition to the completion of the merger. In the event that this proposal is
not approved, the merger cannot be completed.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve
the merger.

PROPOSAL 2
PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c)
under the Exchange Act, we are asking our common stockholders to vote at the special meeting on an
advisory basis regarding the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. Information intended to comply with Item 402(t)
of Regulation S-K concerning this compensation, subject to certain assumptions described therein, is
presented in “The Merger - Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification
of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger.”
The stockholder vote on executive compensation is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our
board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms,
subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger
is completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, in
accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation. Approval of this proposal is not
a condition to the completion of the merger.
We are asking our common stockholders to vote “FOR” the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc.’s common stockholders approve, on a non-

In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn
the meeting and reconvene as the chairman of the meeting or the board may determine (subject to certain
restrictions in the merger agreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not be
held, without Parent’s consent, on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special
meeting was originally scheduled).
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve
any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes
at the special meeting to approve the merger.

This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by
our board of directors to be exercised at a special meeting to be held on April 12, 2022, at 11:00 a.m., New
York time. The special meeting will be held solely via live webcast, and there will not be a physical meeting
location, given the current public health impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and our desire to promote the
health and safety of our stockholders, as well as our directors, officers, employees and other constituents.
Only holders of our Common Stock as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive
notice of, and vote at, the special meeting via the Company special meeting website or any adjournment or
postponement thereof.
If you are a holder of record, you will be able to attend the special meeting online, ask a question and vote
by visiting the special meeting website at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/BRG2022SM. You will need to
provide your 16-digit control number that is on your Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, or
on your proxy card if you received proxy materials by mail. If you hold your shares of Common Stock in
“street name” and want to attend the special meeting online by webcast (with the ability to ask a question
and/or vote, if you choose to do so), you must follow the instructions you receive from your broker, bank or
other nominee.
The purpose of the special meeting is for you to consider and vote on the following matters:
a proposal to approve the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December
20, 2021, and as it may be amended from time to time, among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub;
a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger;
and
a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger.
Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the Notice
of Special Meeting may be brought before the special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of issued
and outstanding Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger is
required to approve the merger and for the merger to occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Exhibit A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully in its entirety.",38,38

All holders of record of our Common Stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on March
7, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the special meeting or any postponement or
adjournment of the special meeting. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote on each matter
presented at the special meeting for each share of Class A Common Stock that such holder owned as of the
record date, and will be entitled to cast 50 votes on each matter presented at the special meeting for each
share of Class C Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, there were
29,260,629 shares of Class A Common Stock and 76,603 shares of Class C Common Stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence virtually via the special meeting website or by proxy of our stockholders entitled to cast a
majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the
special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be
counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If you fail to submit a
proxy prior to the special meeting or to vote at the special meeting via the special meeting website, your
30 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
shares of Common Stock will not be counted toward a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the special
meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later date. Under the Maryland General
Corporation Law and our bylaws, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the special meeting whether or
not a quorum is present (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, including that in certain
circumstances the special meeting may not be held, without Parent’s consent, on a date that is more than 30
days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).",38,39
"Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc._20220311_DEFM14A_19938922_4406918.Pdf",Required Vote,"Required Vote
Completion of the merger requires approval of the merger by the affirmative vote of the stockholders entitled
to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger by the holders of issued and outstanding
Common Stock. Each stockholder will be entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special
meeting for each share of Class A Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date, and will be
entitled to cast 50 votes on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Class C Common
Stock that such holder owned as of the record date. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on
the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if
you fail to vote by proxy or at the special meeting via the special meeting website (including by abstaining),
or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as
voting against the proposal to approve the merger.
In addition, each of the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and the proposal to approve
adjournment of the meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.
Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these
proposals, if you fail to vote by proxy or at the special meeting via the special meeting website, or fail to
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of
such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome
of these proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
Accordingly, in order for your Common Stock to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must either
return the enclosed proxy card, authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the
Internet, or vote at the special meeting via the special meeting website. The vote of the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock is not required to approve any of the proposals at the special meeting and is not being
solicited.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of
approximately 818,724 shares of our Class A Common Stock and approximately 72,964 shares of our Class C
Common Stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 13.50% of the voting power of our Common Stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting, in each case including excess shares. Our directors and executive
officers have informed us that they intend to vote the Common Stock that they own in favor of the proposal
to approve the merger, in favor of the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation and in favor of
the proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting. Under the stockholders agreement, if at any meeting of
stockholders the holders of Class C Common Stock own shares of Class C Common Stock representing more
than 9.9% of the voting rights of the then-outstanding Common Stock (such shares, the “excess shares”),
then such holders shall vote such excess shares as directed by the board of directors. Under the merger
agreement, unless the board of directors effects a company adverse recommendation change, any excess
shares must be voted in favor of the approval of the merger. In addition, R. Ramin Kamfar, James G. Babb III,
Ryan S. MacDonald, Jordan B. Ruddy, Michael L. Konig (who are members of our management) and certain
of their affiliated entities, solely in their capacity as our stockholders and limited partners of our operating
partnership, have entered into support agreements requiring, among other things, such persons (i) to vote
their respective covered shares, other than any excess shares, in favor of the proposal to approve the
merger, (ii) to vote their respective covered shares, other than any excess shares, against any company
takeover proposal (as defined in “The Merger Agreement - Company Stockholders’ Meeting”) and any other
action that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, materially delay, materially
postpone or adversely affect the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or
result in a breach in any material respect of any of the covenants, representations or warranties or other
obligations or agreements of us under the merger agreement, of us or Bluerock Homes under the separation
documentation or of such holder under the applicable support agreement, and (iii) not

Holders of record of our Common Stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of
the following methods:
mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail;
authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the
instructions included with your proxy card; or
appear and vote at the special meeting via the special meeting website.
Regardless of whether you plan to attend the special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your
Common Stock as described above as promptly as possible.
Under NYSE American rules, all the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can
be no broker non-votes at the special meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker,
trust or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker, trust or other nominee has not
received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting
of the shares on a particular proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such
meeting. Accordingly, if your shares are held in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you
must direct your intermediary regarding how you would like your shares voted by following the voting
instructions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee; or, if you want to participate in the special
meeting, you must follow the instructions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee. Brokers,
banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three
proposals described in this proxy statement. Because the proposal to approve the merger requires the
affirmative vote of the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the
merger by the holders of issued and outstanding Common Stock, the failure to provide your bank, broker,
trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal
to approve the merger. Because the approval of each of (1) the proposal to approve the merger-related
compensation and (2) the proposal to adjourn the meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast on such proposal, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have
discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other
nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is
present.",40,40

If you authorize a proxy, your Common Stock will be voted at the special meeting as you indicate on your
proxy. If no instructions are indicated when you authorize your proxy, your Common Stock will be voted in
accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors. Our board of directors recommends that you
vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger, “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger-related
compensation and “FOR” the proposal to approve adjournment of the meeting.

You may revoke your proxy at any time, but only before the proxy is voted at the special meeting, in any of
three ways:
by delivering, prior to the date of the special meeting, a written revocation of your proxy dated after
the date of the proxy that is being revoked to our Secretary at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 32nd

by delivering to our Secretary a later-dated, duly executed proxy or by authorizing your proxy by
telephone or by Internet at a date after the date of the previously authorized proxy relating to the
same shares of Common Stock; or
by voting at the special meeting via the special meeting website.
Attendance at the special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy. If
you own Common Stock in “street name,” you may revoke or change previously granted voting instructions

Our management and board of directors regularly review our performance and prospects in light of the
current business, economic, capital markets and real estate environments, as well as developments in the
multi-family and single-family residential real estate businesses and the opportunities and challenges facing
participants in those businesses. These reviews have included consideration, from time to time, of potential
strategic alternatives that could, taking into account market cycles and the level of investor demand for asset
classes represented in our portfolio, enhance and realize the value of our portfolio for our stockholders,
including potential acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and business combination transactions, as well
as remaining an independent standalone company. In connection with these reviews, our management from
time to time evaluates the properties in our portfolio, individually and collectively, and opportunities to
enhance and realize the value of such properties for our stockholders. Our board of directors and
management have also considered the potential benefits that might result from enabling greater strategic and
management focus within our single-family residential real estate business by separating it from our multi-
family residential real estate business and spinning it off to our stockholders as a standalone public
company, which would also provide an opportunity for stockholders to invest only in our single-family
residential business.
On July 27, 2021, the board of directors held a meeting which was attended by management and
representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, outside legal counsel to the Company (“Wachtell
Lipton”), and KVCF, PLC, outside legal counsel to the Company (“KVCF”). During this meeting, the board of
directors, with the assistance of management, reviewed our business performance and outlook in light of
general market conditions and considered opportunities and risks in our multi-family and single-family
residential real estate businesses. The directors discussed, among other matters, management’s assessment
that the accumulation of available equity capital for stabilized multi-family residential real estate assets
resulting in low capitalization rates for those assets, strong revenue fundamentals in the multi-family
residential real estate market in the sunbelt region, increasing supply of multi-family residential real estate
assets, as well as the possibility of interest rate increases in the future, coupled with improvements in the
outlook for the single-family residential real estate market and opportunities for margin improvement and
value creation in the Company’s portfolio of single-family residential real estate assets, presented an
opportune environment for the Company to explore a potential strategic transaction involving the sale of our
portfolio of multi-family residential real estate. The directors discussed with management and our advisors
the advantages and disadvantages of potential transaction structures, including with respect to tax
efficiency and the allocation of risk, and that a transaction involving a sale of our portfolio of multi-family
residential real estate assets and a spin-off to our stockholders of our portfolio of single-family residential
real estate assets offered several advantages relative to alternative transaction structures. R. Ramin Kamfar,
our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, conveyed management’s belief, which the
board of directors agreed with, that it would be in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders for
the board of directors to receive the assistance of one or more financial advisors to assess and pursue
potential strategic opportunities, including a sale of our portfolio of multi-family residential real estate assets
and a spin-off to our stockholders of our portfolio of single-family residential real estate assets, and the
board of directors discussed potential financial advisors. The Company later selected Morgan Stanley,
Eastdil Secured Advisors LLC (“Eastdil”) and BofA Securities, Inc. (“Bank of America”), based on their
qualifications, expertise and reputation in our sector, and their knowledge of the business and affairs of the
Company and of potential counterparties, to serve as our financial advisors in connection with a potential
strategic transaction.
Following the July 27, 2021 meeting of the board of directors, the Company, at the direction of the board of
directors and with the assistance of its advisors, confirmed the optimal transaction structure and
34 TABLE OF CONTENTS
designed a process for the sale of our portfolio of multi-family residential real estate assets and a spin-off to
our stockholders of our portfolio of single-family residential real estate assets. Throughout August and
continuing through the first week of September 2021, the Company began to prepare for outreach to
potential transaction counterparties after Labor Day 2021 and to assemble due diligence information that
could be made available to potential transaction counterparties. Also during this period, the Company began
to consider retaining additional advisors to assess and opine on aspects of the potential separation
transaction, including the external management of Bluerock Homes. The Company, at the direction of the
board of directors, later in the process selected Duff & Phelps to provide advice with respect to the
separation and the distribution, including the Exchange, and Stanger to provide advice with respect to terms
of a Management Agreement to be entered into by Bluerock Homes and an external manager that would be
owned by certain members of the Company’s management (the “Manager”). The Company selected Duff &
Phelps and Stanger based on their qualifications, expertise and reputation, and their knowledge of the
business and affairs of the Company.
Over the course of the period between September 8, 2021, and September 16, 2021, representatives of Morgan
Stanley and Eastdil, at the Company’s direction, contacted 16 parties identified by the Company, Morgan
Stanley and Eastdil as potentially having an interest in a potential transaction with the Company, including
Blackstone on September 9, 2021.
On September 14, 2021, the Company received a written indication of interest from a third party (“Party A”)
setting forth the terms of an unsolicited, non-binding offer to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of the
Company in an all-cash transaction at a price of $13.89 per share.
On September 16, 2021, Bloomberg reported that the Company was evaluating strategic alternatives (the
“September 16 Bloomberg article”). Thereafter, 38 additional parties contacted the Company, Morgan Stanley
or Eastdil regarding a potential transaction. The Company and our financial advisors invited all such parties
to enter into non-disclosure agreements. Of the 55 total parties (including Party A), 28 executed non-
disclosure agreements with the Company.
On September 20, 2021, the board of directors held a meeting, with representatives of Wachtell Lipton and
KVCF in attendance. The directors discussed the latest developments in our assessment of a potential
strategic transaction. The board of directors also discussed the written indication of interest received from
Party A. The board of directors determined to instruct Morgan Stanley to invite Party A to participate in the
strategic transaction process, which would involve Party A entering into a non-disclosure agreement and
conducting due diligence, in order to allow Party A to submit a more attractive proposal.
During the last week of September and continuing through the first half of November 2021, the potential
transaction counterparties that had executed non-disclosure agreements received access to a virtual data
room containing information regarding our multi-family residential real estate portfolio and were able to
conduct due diligence, including through telephone calls and videoconferences with our management and
our advisors.
On October 18, 2021, at the Company’s direction, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil provided a
process letter (the “October 18 process letter”) to the 28 potential transaction counterparties that had
executed non-disclosure agreements, which letter invited such parties to submit, no later than November 9,
2021, non-binding indications of interest regarding a transaction to acquire the Company. The October 18
process letter indicated that the Company, at the time of sale, would consist of only our interest in our 30
multi-family residential real estate operating assets and mezzanine and preferred investments in 25 multi-
family residential real estate assets.
On November 2, 2021, the board of directors held a meeting to discuss various matters and received an
update from representatives of management regarding the potential strategic transaction process, including
with respect to the potential transaction counterparties that had executed non-disclosure agreements and
their due diligence activity to date.
Over the course of November 9, 2021, and November 10, 2021, 10 potential transaction counterparties
submitted non-binding indications of interest for our multi-family residential real estate portfolio. The initial
indications of interest contemplated gross asset values between $2.6 billion and $3.5 billion for the assets
that the Company would own at the time of the potential transaction. Of the 10 proposals received from
35 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
potential transaction counterparties, the four highest contemplated gross asset valuations of at least $3.2
billion: one potential transaction counterparty (“Party B”) proposed a $3.5 billion gross asset valuation of
the assets proposed to be sold in the potential transaction, while Blackstone and another potential
transaction counterparty (“Party C”) each proposed a $3.4 billion gross asset valuation, and another
potential transaction counterparty (“Party D”) proposed a $3.2 billion gross asset valuation. Party A
submitted a proposal that contemplated a $2.9 billion gross asset value. No potential transaction
counterparty expressed interest in any of our assets other than the multi-family residential real estate
portfolio.
Following the submission of the initial non-binding indications of interest, the Company and representatives
of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil considered how to continue the process. The Company, in consultation with
Morgan Stanley and Eastdil, believed that, subject to approval by the board of directors, the optimal path
forward was to invite the four highest bidders into the second round of the process, and inform the
remaining parties that submitted indications of interest that they would have to increase the value of their
proposals in order to participate in the next round of bidding. On November 16, 2021, the Company directed
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil to invite, subject to the approval of the board of directors,
each of Blackstone and Parties B, C and D to participate in a second phase of due diligence and thereafter to
submit a best and final proposal, including the price per share of Common Stock, at which such party would
be willing to acquire the Company at a time when it would consist only of our multi-family residential real
estate portfolio. Each such party was requested to submit, no later than December 6, 2021, a mark-up of a
draft merger agreement to be provided to each such party, and to submit its best and final proposal no later
than December 15, 2021. All potential transaction counterparties that submitted initial indications of interest
other than Blackstone and Parties B, C and D were advised by representatives of Morgan Stanley and
Eastdil, on behalf of the Company, that they would have to increase the value of their proposals in order to
participate in the next round of bidding. None of these other parties increased the value of their proposals.
On November 18, 2021, the board of directors met to discuss the status of the strategic transaction process,
with representatives of management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Eastdil, Wachtell Lipton and
KVCF in attendance. During the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil presented an
overview of the initial indications of interest and the plan proposed by the Company in consultation with its
advisors to advance the four highest bidders to the second round of the process and invite others to
improve their proposals in order to remain in the process. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with
the directors their duties in connection with their consideration of potential strategic alternatives for the
Company. Following the presentations from our advisors and discussion among the directors, the board of
directors directed our management and financial advisors to continue to engage with each of Blackstone and
Parties B, C and D in order to be in a position, following the receipt of best and final proposals on December
15, 2021, to expeditiously enter into definitive transaction documentation with one of such parties if the
Company were to receive an acceptable proposal.
During the course of November 18, 2021, and November 19, 2021, management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, Eastdil and Wachtell Lipton held separate videoconferences with Blackstone, Party C and
Party D in order to discuss the transaction structure and the process by which the Bluerock Homes Business
would be separated from the remainder of our business. Party B scheduled a videoconference with
management and its advisors, to be held on November 22, 2021, in order to receive an overview of the
proposed transaction structure and the process by which the Bluerock Homes Business would be separated
from the remainder of our business, but subsequently cancelled the meeting and did not reschedule.
Also on November 19, 2021, a draft merger agreement was provided to Blackstone and Parties B, C and D in
the virtual data room. The proposed draft of the merger agreement provided for, among other things: (1) the
separation of the Bluerock Homes Business from our multi-family residential real estate business and the
distribution of shares of Bluerock Homes common stock to our stockholders as contemplated by separation
principles that would be attached to the merger agreement, (2) an outside date of nine months from the date
of the agreement, after which date the merger agreement would be terminable by either party if the potential
transaction had not yet been completed, (3) a termination fee equal to 3.0% of the Company’s equity value
implied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by the Company upon a termination of the
merger agreement under certain circumstances, (4) a reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company’s
equity value implied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by

the purchaser upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances and (5) the right of
the Company to continue to pay, during the pendency of the merger, a quarterly cash dividend to holders of
Common Stock not in excess of $0.17 per share per quarter.
On November 23, 2021, and November 24, 2021, respectively, Party B and Party D separately indicated to
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil that they would not be prepared to provide an actionable
proposal on December 15, 2021, and that they each were uncertain about their ability to make such a
proposal even with a greater amount of time. Party B and Party D were each advised by representatives of
Morgan Stanley and Eastdil that, although the Company did not presently intend to extend the deadline for
the submission of proposals, each such party should continue to perform due diligence. However, both Party
B and Party D ceased their due diligence activity in the virtual data room and did not thereafter contact the
Company or our advisors with respect to a potential transaction.
Throughout the second half of November and the first half of December 2021, Blackstone and Party C, with
the assistance of their advisors, conducted additional due diligence with respect to the Company and its
multi-family residential real estate portfolio and discussed the structure of the potential transaction,
including through telephone calls and videoconferences with our management and our advisors, including
Morgan Stanley, Eastdil, Wachtell Lipton, KVCF and Vinson & Elkins LLP, tax counsel to the Company, as
well as due diligence site visits at certain properties within our multi-family residential real estate portfolio. In
these discussions, representatives of Morgan Stanley, Eastdil and Wachtell Lipton communicated to each of
Blackstone and Party C that they were not the only potential transaction counterparty that had submitted a
compelling initial indication of interest, and that any final proposals submitted by such parties should take
into account this competitive dynamic, including with respect to purchase price and contract terms.
On November 27, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil, at the Company’s direction, provided
a draft of the separation principles to each of Blackstone and Party C. The draft of the separation principles
provided for, among other things, a target cash level for the Company (after giving effect to separation of the
Bluerock Homes Business) at the closing of the merger, with all cash above that amount to be contributed to
the Bluerock Homes Business.
On December 1, 2021, representatives of Party C delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Wachtell Lipton, ahead of the December 6 deadline for comments to the merger agreement.
Among other terms, the revised draft of the merger agreement submitted by Party C provided for, among
other things: (1) an outside date of six months from the date of the agreement, after which date the merger
agreement would be terminable by either party if the potential transaction had not yet been completed, (2) a
termination fee equal to 4.0% of the Company’s equity value implied by the transaction, including Preferred
Stock, payable by the Company upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, (3)
reimbursement by the Company of Party C’s out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
transaction in the event of a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, (4) a reverse
termination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company’s equity value implied by the transaction, including Preferred
Stock, payable by Party C upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances and (5)
the right of the Company to pay, during the pendency of the merger, up to two quarterly cash dividends to
holders of Common Stock, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per quarter. The revised draft of the merger
agreement did not include a financing contingency.
Thereafter, between December 1, 2021, and December 6, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton exchanged
drafts of the transaction documentation and discussed various terms thereof with representatives of Party C
with a view towards improving the terms of Party C’s final proposal. Among other things, Party C was
informed numerous times that the outside date, and its impact on the certainty of closing given the potential
timeline to consummate the separation and the distribution, was a critical factor on which best and final
proposals would be evaluated.
On December 6, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley, on behalf of the Company, informed Blackstone
that the Company had already been negotiating transaction documentation with at least one other potential
transaction party and that Blackstone should assume that, by the December 6, 2021 deadline, the Company
would have received at least one merger agreement that were substantially acceptable to the Company from a
potential transaction counterparty whose initial indications of interest was at or above the valuation of the
multi-family residential real estate portfolio proposed by Blackstone in its initial indication of interest.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 6, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Party C that provided for, among other things: (1) an outside date of six months from the
date of the agreement, which would be extended to nine months from the date of the agreement in certain
circumstances that would render the distribution unable to be completed within six months, (2) a termination
fee equal to 4.0% of the Company’s equity value implied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock,
payable by the Company upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, (3)
reimbursement by the Company of Party C’s out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
transaction in the event of a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, subject to a
maximum reimbursement of 0.5% of the Company’s equity value implied by the transaction, including
Preferred Stock, which reimbursement would be credited against any termination fee that became payable, (4)
a reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company’s equity value implied by the transaction, including
Preferred Stock, payable by Party C upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances
and (5) the right of the Company to pay, during the pendency of the merger, up to three quarterly cash
dividends to holders of Common Stock, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per quarter.
Representatives of Party C characterized the revised draft of the merger agreement as substantially
acceptable to Party C, subject to any revisions from lenders providing financing to Party C in connection
with a potential transaction.
Also on December 6, 2021, representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel to Blackstone
(“Simpson Thacher”), delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell
Lipton. The revised draft of the merger agreement provided for, among other things: (1) an outside date of
nine months from the date of the agreement that could be extended by Blackstone for an additional three
months in the event that all conditions to closing had been satisfied other than the completion of the
separation and the distribution, (2) a termination fee equal to 3.0% of the Company’s equity value implied by
the transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by the Company upon a termination of the merger
agreement under certain circumstances, (3) a reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company’s equity
value implied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by Blackstone upon a termination of the
merger agreement under certain circumstances and (4) the right of the Company to pay, during the pendency
of the merger, a quarterly cash dividend to holders of Common Stock in December 2021 and for the first two
fiscal quarters of 2022, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per quarter. The revised draft of the merger
agreement did not include a financing contingency, but provided that the Company would not have a right to
specific performance to require Blackstone to complete the merger. The revised draft of the merger agreement
also indicated that Blackstone would expect to receive support agreements from holders of our Class C
common stock, including from Mr. Kamfar, our chairman and chief executive officer. Under the stockholders
agreement, dated October 31, 2017 among us and the stockholders party thereto (the “stockholders
agreement”), if at any meeting of stockholders such holders own shares of Class C Common Stock
representing more than 9.9% of the voting rights of our then-outstanding common stock, then such holders
must vote such excess shares as directed by the board of directors. The revised draft of the merger
agreement also provided that unless the board of directors effected a company adverse recommendation
change, any such excess shares would be required to be voted in favor of the approval of the merger.
Representatives of Simpson Thacher also delivered on December 6, 2021, a revised draft of the separation
principles to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. The revised draft of the separation principles provided for,
among other things, a target cash level for the Bluerock Homes Business at the closing of the merger, with
cash in excess of such amount to be retained by the Company.
Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed various terms of the draft merger agreement and
other transaction documents with representatives of Simpson Thacher.
On December 10, 2021, representatives of Simpson Thacher provided to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a
draft form of support agreement to be executed by holders of our Class C common stock.
On December 14, 2021, Party C submitted a revised draft of the merger agreement reflecting comments from
the lenders providing financing to Party C in connection with a potential transaction, along with revised
drafts of the separation principles, equity commitment letter and limited guarantee. Among other revisions,
38 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the revised draft of the merger agreement submitted by Party C provided for: (1) an outside date of six
months from the date of the agreement, without the possibility of an extension to nine months from the date
of the agreement and (2) the right of the Company to pay, during the pendency of the merger, up to two, but
not three, quarterly cash dividends to holders of Common Stock, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per
quarter.
On December 15, 2021, Party C submitted a proposal to acquire the Company (after the separation and
distribution of the Bluerock Homes Business) for $22.22 in cash per share of Common Stock, reflecting a
gross asset value of $3.5 billion. Party C did not alter its position that the merger agreement should provide
for a six month outside date.
On December 15, 2021, Blackstone submitted a written proposal to acquire the Company for $23.25 in cash
per share of Common Stock. In its letter, Blackstone noted that it had sufficient fully discretionary equity
capital to complete the acquisition of the Company without any partners, and also indicated that it had
completed all of its due diligence and was prepared to sign binding definitive documentation as soon as
possible. Blackstone included with its written proposal revised drafts of the merger agreement and the
separation principles. The revised draft of the merger agreement provided for, among other things: (1) an
outside date of nine months from the date of the agreement, which could be extended in certain
circumstances by the Company to up to 10 months, and by Blackstone to up to 12 months from the date of
the merger agreement, (2) a termination fee equal to 3.0% of the Company’s equity value implied by the
transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by the Company upon a termination of the merger agreement
under certain circumstances, (3) a reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the Company’s equity value
implied by the transaction, including Preferred Stock, payable by Blackstone upon a termination of the
merger agreement under certain circumstances and (4) the right of the Company to pay, during the pendency
of the merger, a quarterly cash dividend to holders of Common Stock in December 2021 and for the first two
fiscal quarters of 2022, not in excess of $0.1625 per share per quarter.
Following submission of Blackstone’s proposal, representatives of Morgan Stanley, on behalf of the
Company, contacted representatives of Blackstone to encourage Blackstone to increase its bid. Blackstone
thereafter engaged in multiple discussions with representatives of Morgan Stanley which culminated in
Blackstone’s oral submission on December 15, 2021, which was confirmed in writing on the morning of
December 16, 2021, of a proposal to acquire the Company (after the separation and distribution of the
Bluerock Homes Business) for $24.25 in cash per share of Common Stock.
On December 16, 2021, the board of directors held a special meeting to review and consider the proposals
submitted by Blackstone and Party C, which meeting was attended by representatives of Morgan Stanley,
Wachtell Lipton, KVCF, Duff & Phelps and Stanger. Representatives of Morgan Stanley presented their
preliminary valuation analyses of the Company, and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Wachtell Lipton
reviewed the terms of the proposals and draft merger agreements and other transaction documents submitted
by Blackstone and Party C, each of which provided for an acquisition of the Company, after the distribution
of shares of Bluerock Homes common stock to our common stockholders, at a significant premium to the
unaffected closing price of $10.85 on September 15, 2021, the last day prior to the September 16 Bloomberg
article reporting that the Company was considering strategic alternatives. The directors, management and
our advisors discussed Blackstone’s experience in acquiring real estate assets and its substantial available
capital, as well as Blackstone’s willingness to provide for an outside date that could be extended by the
Company to up to 10 months after execution of the merger agreement in order to accommodate the potential
timeline to consummate the separation and distribution. The directors, management and our advisors also
considered that the draft merger agreement submitted by Blackstone did not entitle the Company to
specifically enforce the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter, and that the Company’s exclusive
remedy would be limited to a $200 million reverse termination fee payable by Parent in certain circumstances
(the payment of which would be guaranteed by Blackstone Real Estate Partners IX L.P.), as well as
Blackstone’s track record of completing REIT acquisitions. The directors, management and the advisors
compared Blackstone’s proposal to Party C’s lower per-share offer, and also considered the uncertainties in
the financing plan proposed by Party C, as well as its proposal for an outside date of six months from the
date of the merger agreement, which the board of directors believed increased the risk of not closing. The
board of directors also considered the number of potential transaction counterparties that expressed an
interest in a transaction involving our multi-family residential real estate
39 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
portfolio and participated in the transaction process, but that only Blackstone indicated it would be able to
acquire the Company on terms that would be acceptable to the Company. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton
reviewed the structure of the proposed transaction and the steps to be taken to consummate the separation
and the distribution, including the operating partnership’s distribution of its interests in the New LP holding
our multi-family residential real estate business to the Company as consideration for a redemption of the
Redeemed Units in the Exchange, followed by a contribution of the Company’s remaining interest in the
operating partnership to Bluerock Homes prior to the distribution. The directors, management and our
advisors also discussed the treatment of management and their interests in the proposed transaction,
including the Exchange, which will result in an increase in the ownership of the Bluerock Homes Business by
holders of operating partnership interests (other than Bluerock Homes), and management’s commitment to
our single-family residential real estate business through their commitments not to redeem their operating
partnership interests, as well as management’s ownership of the Manager proposed to enter into the
Management Agreement with Bluerock Homes. The board of directors then received a presentation from Duff
& Phelps regarding the proposed terms of the Exchange and a presentation from Stanger regarding the
proposed terms of the Management Agreement between Bluerock Homes and its Manager. After deliberation,
the board of directors determined that Blackstone was the potential acquirer that was likely to offer the
greatest value and the greatest certainty of closing and that the Company should pursue the potential
transaction with Blackstone but continue to improve the terms of the merger agreement and other transaction
documents.
Over the course of the following days, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Simpson Thacher negotiated
the remaining unresolved terms in the merger agreement and other transaction documents.
On December 18, 2021, Party C submitted a revised proposal, increasing its proposed purchase price to
$23.00 in cash per share of Common Stock. Party C did not offer any extension to the six-month outside date
contemplated by its revised draft of the merger agreement submitted on December 14, 2021. Party C also
explained that it would require until the end of December 2021 in order to be in a position to enter into a
merger agreement and announce a transaction.
On the afternoon of December 19, 2021, the board of directors held a special meeting during which
management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Wachtell Lipton reviewed the history of the
transaction process, negotiations with Blackstone and Party C and the terms of Blackstone’s proposal.
Representatives of Eastdil, Bank of America, KVCF and Duff & Phelps were also in attendance.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an updated financial presentation regarding the final proposal
from Blackstone and a valuation analysis of the Company and then delivered to the board of directors
Morgan Stanley’s oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of the date of such opinion and
subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the merger agreement is
fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Common Stock. Prior to the meeting, the
directors were provided with a relationship disclosure letter from Morgan Stanley, Eastdil, Bank of America,
Duff & Phelps and Stanger, and, at the meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the
directors the relationship disclosure letters. The directors also received, prior to the meeting, the Duff &
Phelps Opinion and the Stanger Opinion. At the meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with
the directors their duties in connection with their consideration and potential approval of the transaction
with Blackstone. Following discussion, the board of directors unanimously determined and declared the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, to be advisable and in the best
interests of the Company and our stockholders and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the
merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and resolved to
recommend that the holders of Common Stock approve the merger. In addition, the board of directors and
management discussed our communications plan with respect to the proposed transaction with Blackstone
and reviewed a draft press release to be issued in connection with the transaction.
The parties finalized and executed the merger agreement and the other transaction documents early in the
morning of December 20, 2021. Thereafter, later in the morning of December 20, 2021, the parties issued a
press release announcing the transaction.

"Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc._20220311_DEFM14A_19938922_4406918.Pdf",Reasons for the Merger,"Reasons for the Merger
In reaching its decision to determine and declare the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders and to
approve the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend that the holders of Common Stock approve
the merger, the board of directors consulted with our senior management team, as well as our financial and
legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors which the board
of directors viewed as supporting its decision:
the current and historical trading prices of shares of Common Stock, and the fact that the merger
consideration of $24.25 per share in cash (without taking into account the value of the shares of
Bluerock Homes to be received by holders of Common Stock in the distribution) represents a premium
of approximately 124% to the unaffected closing price of $10.85 on September 15, 2021, the last day
prior to the September 16 Bloomberg article reporting that the Company was considering strategic
alternatives;
the course and history of competitive negotiations between the Company and the potential
transaction counterparties, including Party C and Blackstone, and the belief of the board of directors
that it had obtained Blackstone’s best and final offer and that it was unlikely that any other party
would be willing to transact at a higher valuation;
the fact that Party C’s highest bid was $23.00 per share and that Party C’s proposal provided for a six
month outside date;
the process conducted by the Company, including the fact that the Company or our advisors
contacted or were contacted by 55 potential transaction counterparties, including following the
September 16 Bloomberg article reporting that the Company was evaluating strategic alternatives, and
that a total of 28 parties executed non-disclosure agreements with the Company in order to conduct
due diligence;
the fact that no potential transaction counterparty that submitted an initial indication of interest
(other than Party A in its initial unsolicited proposal prior to Party A’s participation in the process),
expressed any interest in any of our assets other than the multi-family residential real estate portfolio;
the fact that all potential transaction counterparties that submitted initial indications of interests,
other than the four highest bidders, whose proposals exceeded $3.2 billion in gross asset value and
who advanced to the final round of diligence and proposals, were advised by representatives of
Morgan Stanley and Eastdil, on behalf of the Company, that they would have to increase the value of
their proposals in order to participate in the next round of bidding, and that no such parties increased
the value of their proposals;
the fact that, in late November 2021, each of Party B and Party D indicated that it was uncertain about
its ability to make a best and final proposal prior to the December 15, 2021 deadline for the submission
of proposals, or even with a greater amount of time, and the fact that, while Party B and D were
advised by representatives of Morgan Stanley and Eastdil, on behalf of the Company, that, although
the Company did not intend to delay the deadline, each such party should continue to perform due
diligence, both Party B and Party D subsequently ceased their due diligence activity in the virtual
data room and did not thereafter contact the Company or our advisors with respect to a potential
transaction;
the belief of the board of directors that further extending the deadline for best and final proposals or
otherwise soliciting other potential buyers could jeopardize the availability of Blackstone’s proposal
and would not yield proposals of greater value or with increased certainty to closing;
our right under the merger agreement, in response to unsolicited acquisition proposals, to furnish
information to and conduct negotiations with third parties in certain circumstances;
the right of the board of directors, under the merger agreement, to change, withhold, qualify or
withdraw its recommendation that the holders of Common Stock approve the merger under certain

TABLE OF CONTENTS
circumstances, subject to payment of a termination fee if Parent elects to terminate the merger
agreement in such circumstances;
our right to terminate the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, in order to enter into a
definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a superior proposal if the board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with our independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel and after consideration of any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in
writing by Parent, that the superior proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal, upon
payment of a termination fee;
the fact that the $60 million termination fee payable by us in certain circumstances (representing
approximately 3.0% of the Company’s equity value and 1.7% of its enterprise value, in each case,
based on the merger consideration) was viewed by our board of directors, after consultation with our
legal and financial advisors, as reasonable and not likely to preclude any other party from making a
competing acquisition proposal;
the fact that the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our stockholders with
certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the closing of the merger, in comparison to the risks,
uncertainties and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent value from our business plan for
our multi-family residential real estate assets or other possible strategic alternatives;
the fact that holders of Common Stock will also receive shares of Bluerock Homes common stock in
the distribution, enabling holders of Common Stock to continue to participate in value creation in our
portfolio of single-family residential real estate assets, and the belief of the board of directors,
following review and consideration of our business plan and the prospects of Bluerock Homes on a
standalone basis, that the combined value of the merger consideration and the shares of Bluerock
Homes common stock that stockholders will receive in the distribution represents the best available
opportunity for the Company;
the opportunity for investors, including holders of Common Stock, to evaluate the Bluerock Homes
Business independently of our multi-family residential real estate business and better assess the
distinctive merits, performance and future prospects of the Bluerock Homes Business, and to better
control their asset allocation decisions;
the fact that Bluerock Homes will have a distinct business strategy focused on our single-family
residential real estate properties and the opportunity for its experienced management team to focus
on the Bluerock Homes Business and its growth strategy;
management’s commitment to our single-family residential real estate business through the interests
of members of management in the operating partnership and their commitments not to redeem their
operating partnership interests, making more of the cash consideration available to our stockholders;
the fact that Bluerock Homes would be externally managed, including that the Manager will bear
certain expenses that would otherwise be borne by Bluerock Homes;
the knowledge of the board of directors of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and
prospects of the Company, including its multi-family and single-family residential businesses, as well
as its knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which the Company and each of its
businesses operates, including economic and market conditions;
the accumulation of available equity capital for stabilized multi-family residential real estate assets
resulting in low capitalization rates for those assets, strong revenue fundamentals in the multi-family
residential real estate market in the sunbelt region, increasing supply of multi-family residential real
estate assets, as well as the possibility of interest rate increases in the future, which the board of
directors and management believed made for opportune conditions for a sale of our multifamily
assets;
the risks and uncertainties of remaining a public company owner of our multi-family residential real
estate portfolio, including the relatively high discount to NAV in the trading price of shares of
Common Stock as compared to that of other public companies in the multi-family residential real
estate business;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the belief that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are more favorable to our
stockholders than other strategic alternatives available to the Company, including after considering
the feasibility of such alternatives and the significant risks and uncertainties associated with
pursuing such alternatives;
the expected probability that the merger would be completed based on, among other things,
Blackstone’s substantial available capital, proven ability to complete large acquisition transactions,
extensive experience in the real estate industry, the absence of a financing condition and the $200
million reverse termination fee payable to the Company if the merger agreement is terminated in
certain circumstances (representing approximately 10.0% of the Company’s equity value and 5.6% of
its enterprise value, in each case, based on the merger consideration), which payment is guaranteed
by Blackstone Real Estate Partners IX L.P.;
the financial analysis of Morgan Stanley reviewed and discussed with the board of directors, and its
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to
the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion,
the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the merger
agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Common Stock (see “-
Opinions of Our Financial Advisors - Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC”);
the financial analysis of Duff & Phelps with respect to the terms of the Exchange and the opinion of
Duff & Phelps that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to and based on the assumptions made
therein, the exchange consideration to be paid by the Company in the Exchange is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Company (see “- Opinions of Our Financial Advisors - Opinion of Duff
& Phelps, A Kroll Business Operating as Kroll, LLC”);
the financial analysis of Stanger with respect to the terms of the Management Agreement and the
opinion of Stanger that, as of the date of such opinion, based upon its analysis and the assumptions,
qualifications and limitations cited therein, and in reliance thereon, that as of the date of such opinion
the terms of the Management Agreement are fair to Bluerock Homes, from a financial point of view
(see “- Opinions of Our Financial Advisors - Opinion of Robert A. Stanger & Company, Inc.”);
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which were reviewed by the board of directors with
our financial and legal advisors, and the fact that such terms were the product of arm’s-length
negotiations between the parties; and
the fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and our stockholders
would be free to reject the merger by voting against the merger for any reason, including if a higher
offer were to be made prior to the stockholders’ meeting (in certain cases subject to payment by the
Company of a $60 million termination fee if the Company subsequently were to enter into a definitive
agreement relating to, or to consummate, an acquisition proposal).
The board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the
merger agreement and the merger:
our inability to solicit competing acquisition proposals and the possibility that the $60 million
termination fee payable by us upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain
circumstances could discourage other potential bidders from making a competing bid to acquire us;
the fact that the merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, due to a failure of
certain conditions to the closing of the merger, including the risk that our stockholders do not

As a matter of general practice, due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates
inherent in preparing financial projections, we do not publicly disclose detailed projections as to
44 TABLE OF CONTENTS
our anticipated financial position or results of operations, other than providing, from time to time, estimated
ranges for the then-current fiscal year of certain expected financial results and operational metrics in our
regular earnings press releases and other investor materials.
However, in connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction, our management prepared and
provided certain unaudited prospective financial information for the Company (the “Company financial
projections”) and for Bluerock Homes (the “Bluerock Homes projections” and, together with the Company
financial projections, the “financial projections”) to our board of directors and to Morgan Stanley and
Stanger for use in connection with their financial analyses and fairness opinions. Certain of the financial
projections were also provided to potential bidders, including Blackstone, in connection with their due
diligence review. A summary of the financial projections is set forth below and is included in this proxy
statement solely for the purpose of providing holders of Company common stock access to certain non-
public information made available to the Company’s board of directors, Morgan Stanley, Stanger and
potential bidders, including Blackstone, as described in this proxy statement. The inclusion of the financial
projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by us that the
information is material.
These financial projections were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public disclosure,
and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial
forecasts, or generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Neither our independent registered public
accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have audited, compiled or performed any procedures
with respect to the financial projections nor expressed an opinion or any form of assurance on the financial
projections or their achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with,
such financial projections.
The financial projections have been included only to reflect information made available to our board of
directors, Morgan Stanley, Stanger and potential bidders, including Blackstone, at the time of certain events
and decisions, are not facts and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and you are
cautioned not to rely on the financial projections. Some or all of the assumptions that have been made in
connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial
projections were prepared. None of the Company, Parent nor any of our or their respective affiliates, advisors
or other representatives assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or
completeness of the financial projections. None of the Company, Parent nor any of their respective affiliates
has or intends to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to, update, revise or correct the financial
projections if any or all of them have become or may become inaccurate (even in the short term) since the
time of their preparation. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the financial
projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.
The financial projections do not reflect changes in general business or economic conditions since the time
they were prepared, changes in our businesses or prospects since the time they were prepared, or any other
transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated at the time the
financial projections were prepared, and the financial projections are not necessarily indicative of current
values or future performance, which may be significantly more favorable or less favorable than as set forth
below and should not be regarded as a representation that the financial forecasts will be achieved. The
financial projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. In
addition, our future financial performance may be affected by our ability to successfully implement a number
of initiatives to improve our operations and financial performance and our ability to achieve strategic goals,
objectives and targets over the applicable periods.
Because the financial projections reflect subjective judgment in many respects, they are susceptible to
multiple interpretations and frequent revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The
financial projections also cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive
with each succeeding year. The estimates and assumptions underlying the financial projections involve
judgments with respect to, among other things, economic, competitive and financial market conditions and
future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business,
economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent
uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industries in which we operate. The
financial projections

constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties
that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results. For additional information
on factors that may cause future financial results to materially vary from the projected results summarized
below, see the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” beginning
on page 22. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be
realized or that actual results will not differ materially from the projected results summarized below, and the
financial projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied
upon as such. Neither we nor our affiliates or advisors or any other person has made any representation to
any of our stockholders or any other person regarding our actual performance compared to the results
included in the financial projections. We have not made any representation to Parent or its affiliates, in the
merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the projections.
The financial projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements
and other information contained in our public filings with the SEC. The financial projections do not take into
account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared, including the merger, the
separation or the distribution. Further, the financial projections do not take into account the effect of any
failure of the merger, the separation or the distribution to be consummated and should not be viewed as
accurate or continuing in that context.
Financial Projections
The following table summarizes the Company financial projections that were provided to our board of
directors and to Morgan Stanley for use in connection with their financial analyses and fairness opinion.
These Company financial projections did not give effect to the separation or the distribution and included
information related to the Company’s existing portfolio of multi-family residential assets that were expected
to be held by the Company at the time of the merger as well as information related to the Company’s existing
portfolio of in-place single-family assets.

Represents the portion of interest income from mezzanine and preferred investments that is paid in cash.
Includes estimated property-level and corporate G&A.
In addition, in connection with its financial analyses and fairness opinion, Morgan Stanley calculated and
disclosed to the board of directors forecasted net operating income (“NOI”) of the Company of $169 million
for the 12 months ending September 30, 2027 by applying, at the direction of our management, a 3% annual
growth rate to the NOI of the Company of $164 million for the 12 months ending September 30, 2026 included
in the Company financial projections.
The Bluerock Homes projections were provided to our board of directors and Morgan Stanley for use in
connection with their financial analyses and fairness opinion. The Bluerock Homes projections included NOI
of $55 million, a NAV of $494 million, EBITDA of $45 million, FFO of $28 million, a Net Debt / EBITDA ratio of
15.6x and a Total Debt / Gross Asset Value (“GAV”) ratio of 60%, in each case assuming full deployment over
a full year (12-month) period. “Full deployment” assumes the acquisition by Bluerock Homes of $908 million
of incremental assets using 60% leverage and proceeds from mezzanine and preferred investments, a line of
credit draw, property debt on existing assets and existing cash.
The Company provided to Morgan Stanley and to potential bidders, including Blackstone, in connection
with their due diligence a subset of the Company financial projections with respect to the Company’s
existing multi-family residential real estate assets that were expected to be held by the Company at the time
of the merger. These financial projections included NOI for the Company’s operating portfolio of multi-family
residential real estate assets of $135 million and estimated property-level G&A of $3.4 million, in each case
for the 12-month period ending December 1, 2022. The Company also provided projections of interest income
paid in cash of $13 million, $13 million, $12 million, $9 million and $8 million for the 12-month periods ending
September 30, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 respectively for the portion of the Company’s mezzanine /
preferred portfolio that were expected to be held by the Company at the time of the merger. The Company did
not provide bidders with financial information contemplated by the “full deployment” assumptions
underlying the Bluerock Homes projections, as discussed above, or with respect to the reinvestment of
proceeds received from maturing mezzanine and preferred investments in the multi-family residential real
estate portfolio nor with respect to certain mezzanine or preferred investments that were not expected to be
held by the Company at the time of the merger.
The Company also provided financial projections to the board of directors and to Stanger in connection with
its fairness opinion that included $0 in incentive fees payable to the Manager under the Management
Agreement under three scenarios assuming capital raises of $1 billion, $1.25 billion and $1.5 billion.
Certain of the above financial projections above were not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including NOI,
Mezzanine / Preferred Cash Flows, EBITDA, G&A, Capex, Funding Commitments, NAV, FFO, Net Debt, Total
Debt, GAV, interest income and incentive fees. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our
financial results and believe that they enhance investors’ understanding of our financial performance and the
comparability of our results to prior periods, as well as against the performance of REITs. Non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information
prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ
from others in the industry and are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled amounts used by other
companies. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the financial projections were relied upon by Morgan
Stanley for purposes of its fairness opinion and by the board of directors in connection with its
consideration of the merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the
definition of non-GAAP financial measures and therefore are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures
of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial
measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon
by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its fairness opinion or by the board of directors in connection with its
consideration of the merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures
included in the financial projections above.
We do not intend to update or otherwise revise the above financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after
the date when they were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the
assumptions underlying such unaudited prospective financial information are no longer appropriate.

Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
We retained Morgan Stanley to provide us with financial advisory services in connection with a possible
strategic transaction. We selected Morgan Stanley to act as our financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s
qualifications, expertise and reputation in our sector, and its knowledge of the business and affairs of the
Company and of potential counterparties. As part of this engagement, our board of directors requested that
Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the Consideration to be received by
the holders of shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the merger agreement. On December 19, 2021, at a
meeting of our board of directors, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in
writing by delivery of a written opinion to our board of directors dated December 19, 2021, that, as of that
date and based on and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the
written opinion, the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of our Common Stock pursuant to
the merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of our Common Stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of December 19, 2021, is attached to this proxy
statement as Exhibit B and is hereby incorporated into this proxy statement by reference in its entirety. You should
read the opinion in its entirety for a discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. We
encourage you to read the entire opinion and the summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion below carefully and in their
entirety. This summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the opinion. Morgan Stanley’s opinion is directed to our board of directors, in its capacity
as such, addresses only the fairness of the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of our Common Stock
pursuant to the merger agreement from a financial point of view to such holders as of the date of the opinion and does
not address any other aspects or implications of the Transactions. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and
does not, constitute a recommendation to any holder of shares of our Common Stock as to how to vote at the special
meeting to be held in connection with the merger or whether to take any other action with respect to the Transactions.
Morgan Stanley was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion did not in any manner address the relative merits of
the Transactions as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not
such alternatives could be achieved or are available, nor did it address the underlying business decision of the
Company to enter into the merger agreement or proceed with any other transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement. For purposes of this section entitled “Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,” “the Company” refers to
the Company on a consolidated basis, including the assets and liabilities to be held by Bluerock Homes.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information
of the Company;
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the
Company;
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;

participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and
Parent and certain other parties and their financial and legal advisors;
reviewed the merger agreement, including the separation principles, the term sheet for the
management agreement to be entered into among Bluerock Homes, Bluerock Residential Holdings and
an external manager to be newly formed in connection with the separation and the distribution, the
equity commitment letter, limited guaranty and support agreements, each substantially in the form of
the drafts dated December 19, 2021, and certain related documents; and
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors
as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made
available to Morgan Stanley by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to
the financial projections of the Company, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared
on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company
of the future financial performance of the Company, and Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion on such
projections. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the
merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions that would be material
to its analysis. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion as to the terms of financing by Parent or the terms or
conditions upon which it is obtained. Morgan Stanley did not express any view on, and its opinion did not
address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or any
term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or
amended in connection therewith. Morgan Stanley also assumed that the definitive merger agreement would
not differ in any material respect from the December 19, 2021 draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or
other approvals and consents required in connection with the proposed Transactions, no delays, limitations,
conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated
benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Transactions. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or
regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax
or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or
nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such
persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of our Common Stock in the
transaction. Morgan Stanley also expressed no opinion as to the relative fairness of any consideration to be
received pursuant to the merger agreement to holders of any other equity securities of the Company. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Transactions as compared to any other
alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved
or are available. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities of the Company or Bluerock Homes, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations
or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to them as of, December 19, 2021. Events
occurring after December 19, 2021, may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in
preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection
with its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter to our board of directors dated
December 19, 2021. The following summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses performed
and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses
described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial
analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each

TABLE OF CONTENTS
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses
listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion of such
analyses and of the factors reviewed, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. Furthermore, mathematical analysis
(such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to
below.
For purposes of Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the analyses described below, the consideration to be
received by holders of shares of our Common Stock in connection with the Transactions was assumed to be
$24.25 per share in cash, together with shares of Bluerock Homes common stock to be received by holders of
shares of our Common Stock in the distribution pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.
Comparable Public Companies Analysis
Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain publicly available financial information, publicly available
ratios and publicly available market multiples relating to the Company with equivalent publicly available data
for companies that share similar business characteristics with the Company to derive an implied equity value
reference range for the Company. Morgan Stanley reviewed the following publicly traded companies (which
are referred to as “selected companies” in this section): Preferred Apartment Communities Inc., BRT
Apartments Corp., Centerspace, Independence Realty Trust Inc. and NexPoint Residential Trust Inc.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed certain statistics for each of these companies for
comparison purposes, including the ratios of share price to consensus Wall Street research analyst (“Street
consensus”) estimated funds from operations (“FFO”) for calendar years 2022 and 2023 and share price to
Street consensus estimated adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) for calendar years 2022 and 2023.
Morgan Stanley also analyzed for each of these companies the premium or discount represented by the ratio
of share price to Street consensus estimated NAV per share, the premium or discount represented by the
ratio of share price to Street consensus estimated GAV per share and the capitalization rate implied by each
of these companies’ share prices. The multiples, ratio and implied capitalization rate for each of the selected
companies were calculated using their respective closing prices on December 17, 2021, and were based on
the most recent publicly available information, Capital IQ consensus estimates and SNL Financial consensus
estimates as of December 17, 2021, which represents the last closing price for our Common Stock and the
selected companies’ stock prior to the announcement of the Transactions. Morgan Stanley derived a range
for each metric using the mean value for each statistic for the applicable comparable companies as a midpoint
and setting a range using (a) 2.0x above and below that midpoint for share price to 2022 and 2023 estimated
FFO and share price to 2022 and 2023 estimated AFFO, (b) 2.5% above and below the midpoint for the
premium or discount of share price to Street consensus estimated NAV per share and GAV per share and (c)
0.25% above and below the midpoint for the implied capitalization rate. Morgan Stanley selected these
ranges based on its professional judgment after reviewing the selected companies’ ranges for each metric
and the historical ranges of the Company for each metric.
Morgan Stanley then used these multiple and percentage ranges to derive separate implied per share equity
value reference ranges for the Company using each of the metrics reviewed by applying the range derived
from the comparable companies for each metric to the corresponding Street consensus metrics for the
Company. The following table reflects the results of this analysis:

Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following implied per share equity value reference range
for the Company based on the average of the low and high end of the selected range determined by taking
the average of the respective low and high FFO, AFFO and NAV metrics above, in each case, using levered
value, and the respective GAV and Implied Capitalization Rate metrics above, in each case, using unlevered
value. This analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value reference range for a share of our
Common Stock, as compared to the Consideration:

No company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating
comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are
beyond the Company’s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company and the industry
generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and
prospects of the Company or the industry, or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such
as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company
data.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied equity value per share of our Common Stock, based on a
discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the financial projections provided by our management, which
financial projections are described in the section entitled “- Forward-Looking Financial Information.”
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company
by calculating the present value of estimated future unlevered free cash flows, terminal value and in the
Company’s mezzanine and preferred investments. The “unlevered free cash flows” or “free cash flows” refer
to a calculation of the future cash flows of an asset without including, in such calculation, any debt-
servicing costs. The present value of a terminal value, representing the value of unlevered free cash flows
beyond the end of the forecast period (excluding unlevered free cash flows from mezzanine and preferred
investments), and the present value of the Company’s mezzanine and preferred investments, are added to
arrive at a total aggregate value. Outstanding debt, the liquidation value of preferred equity and
noncontrolling interests are subtracted and the Company’s cash on hand as of September 30, 2021 is added
to arrive at an equity value. The calculated equity value is then divided by the number of fully diluted shares
of our Common Stock, in order to arrive at an implied equity value per share.
The projected unlevered free cash flows from September 30, 2022 through the end of 2026 were discounted to
present value using a range of discount rates from 5.4% to 5.8% representing the Company’s weighted
average cost of capital, which weighted average cost of capital was calculated by Morgan Stanley based on
information provided to it by the Company. The weighted average cost of capital was determined utilizing the
capital asset pricing model to calculate the Company’s cost of equity and utilizing the Company’s current
weighted average interest rate on its current indebtedness to calculate the Company’s cost of debt.
Morgan Stanley then calculated a range of implied terminal enterprise values of the Company as of
September 30, 2026, by applying a range of implied exit capitalization rates of 5.0% to 5.5% to the forecasted
NOI of the Company for the 12 months ending September 30, 2027. The range of capitalization rates was
selected using the Company’s implied capitalization rate as of December 17, 2021 and the Company’s five-
year historical average implied capitalization rate as of December 17, 2021 as the low end and the high end,
respectively. The implied terminal enterprise value of the Company was then discounted to present value
using the range of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital as the discount rates. This present value
of the implied terminal enterprise value of the Company was then added to the implied present value of the
unlevered free cash flows as described above and the implied present value of the Company’s mezzanine and
preferred investments, subtracting outstanding debt, the liquidation value of preferred equity and
noncontrolling interests and adding the Company’s cash on hand as of September 30, 2021, and dividing by
the number of fully diluted shares of Common Stock as of September 30, 2021 (accounting for dilution by
Company Warrants outstanding as of December 14, 2021), all as provided by the Company’s management.

Net Asset Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley analyzed the value of the Company as a function of the net value of its assets. Morgan
Stanley based its net asset value analysis on our management’s estimates of asset value as of September 30,
2021. Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated net asset value per share of our Common Stock by applying
to management’s estimated forward NOI of $131 million a range of capitalization rates of 3.6% to 5.8%, which
range was selected based on, among other factors, market-specific capitalization rates per Green Street.
Morgan Stanley added the estimated value of the Company’s preferred and mezzanine portfolio, cash,
restricted cash, amounts due from affiliates and accounts receivable, prepaids and other, and deducted
property-level debt, accounts payable, other accrued liabilities, amounts due to affiliates, distributions
payable, joint venture partner interests and promotes payable and the liquidation value of preferred equity
from the aggregate value of the Company’s assets. Additionally, Morgan Stanley deducted the estimated
costs required to consummate the Transactions and prepay property-level debt of the Company as provided
by management. An implied per share equity value reference range for the Company was then calculated
based on the range of our net asset values derived from such analysis divided by the number of fully diluted
shares of Common Stock outstanding as of September 30, 2021 (accounting for dilution by Company
Warrants outstanding as of December 14, 2021). This analysis indicated the following implied per share
equity value reference range for each share of our Common Stock, net of estimated transaction costs, as
compared to the Consideration:
Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range
Per Share Consideration
$17.57 to $26.18

Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of selected public company
precedent transactions announced since 2000, in which the targets were publicly traded U.S. multi-family
REITs and the transaction value was at least $100 million (excluding student housing and merger-of-equals
transactions). All transactions that Morgan Stanley found that satisfied the foregoing criteria were included
in the premiums paid analysis.

Morgan Stanley calculated the premiums paid in these transactions over the applicable unaffected stock
price of the acquired company (i.e., the amount by which the price that the purchaser paid for the shares of
the target exceeded the unaffected market price of such shares), which represents the volume-weighted
average stock price for the ten trading days ending five trading days prior to the announcement of such
precedent transactions, or ending five trading days prior to the last unaffected trading date for the target for
precedent transactions in which market rumors or other relevant news impacted the target’s share price prior
to transaction announcement. Morgan Stanley noted that the mean of the premiums paid in these precedent
transactions was 13.8%.
Based on the results of this analysis and the premiums paid in precedent transactions as outlined above,
Morgan Stanley applied a premium range of 9.0% to 17.2% based on the observed bottom quartile and top
quartile, respectively, to the last unaffected price for our Common Stock of $10.85 on September 15, 2021,
which resulted in the following implied Common Stock equity value range of the Company, as compared to
the Consideration:
Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range
Per Share Consideration
$11.82 to $12.72
$24.25 and share(s) of Bluerock Homes common stock to

received in the distribution
No company or transaction utilized in the premiums paid analysis is identical to the Company or the
Transactions. The fact that points in the range of implied value per share of the Company derived from the
valuation of premiums paid in precedent transactions were less than or greater than the Consideration is not
necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the Consideration, but is one of
many factors Morgan Stanley considered.
Historical Stock Price
Morgan Stanley reviewed our stock price performance during the 52 weeks ending December 17, 2021, and
the volume-weighted average stock price during the 30-trading-day and 90-trading-day periods ending

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Private Buyer Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a hypothetical take-private analysis to determine the prices at which a financial
sponsor might effect a leveraged buyout of the Company under current market conditions. In preparing this
analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized the financial projections provided by our management, including estimated
NOI for the years ending September 30, 2022 through September 30, 2026. Morgan Stanley based its analysis
on the financial projections provided by our management and assumed a September 30, 2026 exit at a range
of market capitalization rates of 3.9% to 4.4%. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that (i) the acquisition
occurred on September 30, 2021, based on our September 30, 2021 financial statements, (ii) a five-year hold
period, (iii) the potential impact of any property tax resets was disregarded, (iv) the buyer incurs new CMBS
debt in connection with the transaction in an aggregate principal amount resulting in a loan-to-value ratio of
60%, and (v) the buyer is targeting a levered internal rate of return of 10% to 12%. Based upon these
assumptions, Morgan Stanley calculated the following implied per share equity value reference range for our
Common Stock, as compared to the Consideration:
Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range

Research Analyst Price Targets and NAV Targets
Morgan Stanley reviewed available public market trading price targets for our Common Stock by all four
equity research analysts that provided a price target for the Company prior to November 16, 2021, the date of
the most recent report available at the time of such analysis. Morgan Stanley reviewed the most recent price
target published by each of the analysts prior to such date. These targets reflect each analyst’s estimate of
the future public market trading price of our Common Stock at the time the price target was published. Based
on this review, Morgan Stanley noted that the equity research analysts had the following range of price
targets per share of our Common Stock, as compared to the Consideration:
Research Analyst Price Targets
Per Share Consideration
$11.50 to $14.50
$24.25 and share(s) of Bluerock Homes common stock to
be 
received in the distribution
Morgan Stanley also reviewed available equity research analyst estimates of NAV per share of our Common
Stock prior to November 16, 2021. Morgan Stanley reviewed the most recent estimates of NAV per share
published by five equity research analysts, including four of the same analysts who published price targets
prior to such date. Based on this review, Morgan Stanley noted that the equity research analysts had the
following range of estimates of NAV per share of our Common Stock of the Company, as compared to the
Consideration:
Research Analyst NAV Per Share Estimates
Per Share Consideration
$12.07 to $20.50
$24.25 and share(s) of Bluerock Homes common stock to
be 
received in the distribution
The public market trading price targets and estimates of NAV per share published by equity research
analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for our Common Stock, and these targets
and estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of the Company and
future financial market conditions. Moreover, the NAV per share estimates published by equity research
analysts typically do not account for the costs required to execute a merger. Such costs include transfer
taxes, debt breakage costs, compensation costs trigged by a change of control, professional and advisory
fees, and other miscellaneous costs.
Bluerock Homes Common Stock
Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain publicly available financial information, publicly available
ratios and publicly available market multiples regarding publicly traded U.S. single-family REITs and publicly
traded externally managed REITs, which companies shared certain business characteristics with
54 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Bluerock Homes, including Bluerock Homes’ expected leverage, structure and geographical profile. Morgan
Stanley then applied the 2022 consensus EBITDA multiple, 2022 consensus FFO multiple and Premium/​
Discount to the mean consensus estimated NAV, in each case, of certain of these comparable companies to
our management’s financial projections and estimates with respect to Bluerock Homes’s NAV, EBITDA and
FFO, each as described in the section entitled “Forward-Looking Financial Information,” in order to derive a
reference range of implied trading value of Bluerock Homes per share of Bluerock Residential Common Stock
of $3.45 to $5.98 per share of Bluerock Residential Common Stock, as compared to the $5.60 NAV of Bluerock
Homes per share of Bluerock Residential Common Stock, based on management’s estimate of Bluerock
Homes’ NAV of $494 million.
General
Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its
opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of
all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it
considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of these analyses, without considering all
analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In
addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other
analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above
should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual value of the Company.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters.
These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the businesses of the Company and the
industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of the Company, or the industry, or in the financial markets in general. Many of
these assumptions are beyond the control of the Company. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s
analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a
financial point of view of the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of our Common Stock
pursuant to the merger agreement, and in connection with the delivery of its opinion as of December 19,
2021, to our board of directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at
which shares of our Common Stock might actually trade.
The Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and
was unanimously approved by our board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Company
was unanimously approved by our board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Company
during these negotiations. Morgan Stanley did not, however, recommend any specific form or amount of
consideration to us or our board of directors, or that any specific consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the Transactions. Morgan Stanley was not requested to opine as to, and its
opinion does not in any manner address, the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with
or effect the Transactions or the likelihood of consummation of the Transactions, nor does it address the
relative merits of the Transactions as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other
alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion was not intended to, and does not, express an opinion or a recommendation as to how any holder of
shares of our Common Stock should vote at the special meeting to be held in connection with the merger, or
as to any other action that a holder of shares of our Common Stock should take relating to the Transactions.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and presentation to our board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by our board of directors in deciding to determine and declare that the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders (see “- Reasons for the Merger” and “- Recommendation of Our Board of
Directors”). Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the
55 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
opinion of our board of directors with respect to the Consideration or of whether our board of directors
would have been willing to agree to a different consideration.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other
professionals in accordance with its customary practice. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm
engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its
securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange,
commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing
and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest
on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may
trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for its own account or the accounts of its customers, in
debt or equity securities or loans of Parent or any of its affiliates, the Company or any other company, or any
currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Transactions, or any related derivative instrument. In
addition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may have committed and may commit in the
future to invest in private equity funds managed by affiliates of Parent.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided our board of directors with financial
advisory services and a financial opinion, and we have agreed to pay Morgan Stanley an aggregate fee equal
to approximately $29 million, a portion of which is payable quarterly during the term of Morgan Stanley’s
engagement, a portion of which was contingent upon rendering of Morgan Stanley’s financial opinion and a
portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the merger. We have also agreed to reimburse Morgan
Stanley for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional
advisors, incurred in performing its services. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other
person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates from and against any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities relating to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement.
Other than the financial advisory services related to the Transactions described in the prior paragraph,
Morgan Stanley has not provided financial advisory or other financing services to the Company and its
affiliates in the two years prior to December 17, 2021, and thus has not received any fees related to such
services. Morgan Stanley has provided financial advisory and financing services to Parent and its affiliates
(including certain majority-controlled affiliates and portfolio companies of Parent identified by Morgan
Stanley and disclosed to us) and, in the two years prior to December 17, 2021, received fees of approximately
$250 million to $300 million in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley has advised us that it may also
seek in the future to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Company, Parent or their
respective affiliates and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of those services. The information
disclosed in this paragraph is based upon information provided to us by Morgan Stanley.

Summary of Financial Analyses by Duff & Phelps
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Duff & Phelps in connection with
rendering its opinion to the board of directors. Duff & Phelps noted that the analyses have been designed
specifically for the opinion and may not translate to any other purposes. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex analytical process, and therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. While this summary describes the analyses and factors that Duff & Phelps deemed
material in its presentations to the board of directors and its opinion, it does not purport to be a
comprehensive description of all analyses and factors considered by Duff & Phelps. The opinion is based on
the comprehensive consideration of the various analyses performed. This summary is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the opinion attached as Exhibit C to this proxy statement.
In arriving at its opinion, Duff & Phelps did not attribute any particular weight to any particular analysis or
factor considered by it and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or
factor for purposes of its opinion, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance
of each analysis and factor. Several analytical methodologies were employed by Duff & Phelps in its
analyses, and no one single method of analysis should be regarded as critical to the overall conclusion
reached by Duff & Phelps. Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature
of the available information may further affect the value of particular techniques. Accordingly, Duff & Phelps
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of
the factors considered by Duff & Phelps, without considering all analyses and factors in their entirety, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying the opinion. The conclusion
reached by Duff & Phelps, therefore, is based on the application of Duff & Phelps’s own experience and
judgment to all analyses and factors considered by Duff & Phelps, taken as a whole.
Duff & Phelps used various financial analyses (described in detail below) to estimate the value of the
Bluerock Homes Business’s interests in properties within its portfolio. Duff & Phelps applied different
financial analyses to valuing different properties based on a number of factors unique to each property,
including, among other factors, the type of interest that the Bluerock Homes Business had in such property
and the recency of the investment in such property.
Duff & Phelps combined the valuation results from these financial analyses to determine a range of value for
the Bluerock Homes Business’s interests in the properties within its portfolio. Duff & Phelps then added the
Bluerock Homes Business’s estimated cash and cash equivalents of $168.0 million (which is also the target
cash amount for Bluerock Homes set forth in the separation principles, and was provided to Duff & Phelps
by Company management) to the aggregate value of those interests. The result was a net asset value range
for the Bluerock Homes Business of $483.3 million to $504.1 million. Duff & Phelps noted that the value of the
Bluerock Homes Business of $498.7 million implied by the exchange consideration fell within the range of the
resulting valuations.
Direct Capitalization Analysis for Stabilized Properties
Duff & Phelps employed the direct capitalization approach to estimate the value of certain stabilized
properties in the Bluerock Homes Business portfolio in which the Bluerock Homes Business’s interest is
common equity ownership. These properties were not included in the analysis described in the sections
below entitled “Liquidation Valuation” or “Letter of Intent and Broker Price Opinion Valuation Analyses for
Miscellaneous Properties.” For this purpose, a stabilized property refers to a property that was identified as
a stabilized property by Company management, generally where construction or renovation of the property
had been completed and the property had achieved or nearly achieved a high occupancy rate. Under the
direct capitalization approach, the stabilized NOI for each such property is determined, and then a direct
capitalization analysis is used to determine the gross asset value of the Bluerock Homes Business’s interest
in these portfolio properties by applying a capitalization rate to the stabilized NOI.
58 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of the analysis performed by Duff & Phelps, the stabilized NOI for each such property was
selected by Duff & Phelps in its professional judgment based upon recent third-party appraisals and third-
party broker price opinions, as applicable, for each property. A range of appropriate capitalization rates was
determined using Duff & Phelps’s professional judgment based upon qualitative property characteristics,
competitive position and market conditions, industry surveys, other comparable single-family residential
transactions, single-family portfolio transactions and an analysis of publicly traded REITs that Duff &
Phelps deemed relevant. The high and low capitalization rates for each property were then applied to the
property’s stabilized NOI, and the resulting range of capitalized NOI was used to calculate a high and low
gross asset value of each such property. All debt and preferred equity interests were valued at face value.
The face value of any debt and preferred interests in a property were deducted from these gross asset
values. The resulting figure was multiplied by the Bluerock Homes Business’s percentage of common equity
interest in each property to derive a valuation range of the Bluerock Homes Business’s common equity
interest in each such property.
Liquidation Valuation
Duff & Phelps employed a liquidation valuation to estimate the value of investments in the properties in the
Bluerock Homes Business portfolio in which the Bluerock Homes Business’s investments consist of only
debt or preferred equity. Duff & Phelps also used the liquidation valuation for the properties in the Bluerock
Homes Business in which the Bluerock Homes Business’s investments consists of debt or preferred equity
and common equity ownership and the properties were recently acquired or no NOI was provided by or
ascertainable from information provided by Company management. For these properties, the Bluerock Homes
Business’s investments in the properties were valued at the face value of the investments made by the
Bluerock Homes Business to the date of the valuation. As these valuations were equal to the cost of the
investment by the Bluerock Homes Business, this analysis yielded a single net asset value, with no range.
DCF analyses were utilized to confirm that the values of investments in certain properties were not impaired,
in order to support using liquidation values for these properties.
Letter of Intent and Broker Price Opinion Valuation Analyses for Miscellaneous Properties
For one property for which a letter of intent for a disposition of that property by the Bluerock Homes
Business had been entered into prior to the valuation date, and which was provided by Company
management to Duff & Phelps, the estimated year-end closing sale price of $141 million set forth in the letter
of intent was used to calculate the value of the Bluerock Homes Business’s preferred interest in that
property. From the $141 million purchase price, all debt and preferred interests not held by the Bluerock
Homes Business were deducted. As the resulting value was greater than the face value of preferred interests
held by the Bluerock Homes Business, and thus that preferred interest would not be impaired in the sale, the
value of the Bluerock Homes Business’s preferred interest in the property was valued at the face value of the
preferred investment made by the Bluerock Homes Business.
A third-party broker price opinion was used to value the Bluerock Homes Business’s common equity interest
in one other property. The value of the common equity interest based on the broker price opinion was then
added to the Bluerock Homes Business’s debt and preferred interests in that property to derive a valuation
for the Bluerock Homes Business’s investments in that property.
Summary of Material Financial Analyses by Duff & Phelps
Based on the valuation indications derived from its valuation analyses, Duff & Phelps determined a value
range for the net asset value of the Bluerock Homes Business of $483.3 million to $504.1 million. Duff &
Phelps noted that the value of the Bluerock Homes Business of $498.7 million implied by the exchange
consideration fell within the range of the resulting net asset values. As a result, subject to the assumptions,
qualifications, and limitations set forth in the Duff & Phelps Opinion, Duff & Phelps determined that the
exchange consideration to be paid by the Company in the Exchange is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the Company.

judgment of the person furnishing the same, and Duff & Phelps expressed no opinion with respect to
such projections or the underlying assumptions;
Assumed that information supplied and representations made by Company management were
substantially accurate regarding the Bluerock Homes Business and the Exchange;
Assumed that the merger will be consummated at the price set forth in the merger agreement and that

giving effect to the Exchange to Bluerock Homes and distribution of its ownership interest in
Bluerock Homes to the holders of Common Stock (the “contribution and distribution”);
Assumed that the final versions of all documents reviewed by Duff & Phelps in draft form conformed

market, economic, financial and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of the
opinion, and Duff & Phelps disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in

credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the Exchange.
Duff & Phelps did not evaluate the Company’s solvency or conduct an independent appraisal or physical
inspection of any specific assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise). Duff & Phelps was not requested,
and did not advise the board of directors or any other party with respect to alternatives, to the Exchange.
Duff & Phelps did not express any opinion as to the market price or value of the Company’s common stock
(or anything else) after the announcement or the consummation of the Transactions. The opinion should not
be construed as a valuation opinion, credit rating, solvency opinion, an analysis of the Company’s

creditworthiness, as tax advice, or as accounting advice. Duff & Phelps did not make, and assumes no
responsibility to make, any representation, or render any opinion, as to any legal matter.
In rendering its opinion, Duff & Phelps did not express any opinion with respect to the amount or nature of
any compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons,
relative to the consideration to be received by the public shareholders of the Company in the Transactions,
or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
Fees and Expenses, Prior Relationships
Under the terms of the Company’s engagement letter with Duff & Phelps, we have agreed to pay Duff &
Phelps an aggregate fee of $600,000, $250,000 of which was paid upon its engagement, $250,000 of which was
paid upon Duff & Phelps informing the Company that it was prepared to deliver the opinion (regardless of
the conclusion reached in the opinion), and $100,000 of which was paid upon the public announcement of
the Transactions. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Duff & Phelps for its out-of-pocket
expenses and to indemnify Duff & Phelps and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of Duff &
Phelps’s service as a financial advisor to the board of directors. The terms of the fee arrangement with Duff
& Phelps, which the Company and Duff & Phelps believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were
negotiated at arm’s length between the Company and Duff & Phelps, and the board of directors is aware of
the Transactions. No portion of Duff & Phelps’s fee was contingent on either the conclusions reached in its
opinion or the consummation of the Exchange and the Transactions or any other transaction.
During the two years preceding the date of the opinion, Duff & Phelps has provided certain valuation
services to the Company for which it received fees that are immaterial to Duff & Phelps, and it is the intent of
the Company to engage Duff & Phelps for certain opinion services related to the contribution and
distribution (the fees of which are expected to be immaterial to Duff & Phelps). Additionally, Duff & Phelps
has in the past provided, and continues to provide, affiliates of Parent with periodic portfolio valuation
services. Furthermore, Duff & Phelps has previously been and is currently engaged to provide financial
advisory services to affiliates of Parent in connection with related party transactions and valuation advisory
services for certain of the portfolio companies of affiliates of Parent. For these prior and future engagements,
Duff & Phelps received, and will receive, customary fees (which have been and are expected to be immaterial
to Duff & Phelps), expense reimbursement, and indemnification. For the avoidance of any doubt, Duff &
Phelps is not engaged to provide any services to Parent in connection with the Exchange and the
Transactions. Duff & Phelps may provide valuation and financial advisory services to the Company or the
Company’s board of directors (or any committee thereof) in the future. The information disclosed in this
paragraph is based upon information provided to us by Duff & Phelps.
Opinion of Robert A. Stanger & Company, Inc.
We retained Stanger to provide us with financial advisory services in connection with our board of directors’
consideration of the proposed terms of the Management Agreement. We selected Stanger to act in this
capacity based on Stanger’s qualifications, expertise and reputation in our sector, and its knowledge of the
business and affairs of the Company. As part of this engagement, our board of directors requested that
Stanger evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the proposed terms of the Management
Agreement. Prior to the December 19, 2021 meeting of our board of directors, Stanger delivered its written
opinion to our board of directors, dated December 19, 2021, that, as of that date, Stanger concluded based
upon its analysis and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations cited in its written fairness opinion, and
in reliance thereon, that as of the date of the fairness opinion the terms of the Management Agreement are
fair to Bluerock Homes, from a financial point of view.
The full text of the written opinion of Stanger, dated as of December 19, 2021, is attached to this proxy statement as
Exhibit D and is hereby incorporated into this proxy statement by reference in its entirety. You should read the opinion
in its entirety for a discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications
and limitations on the review undertaken by Stanger in rendering its opinion. The summary of the opinion of Stanger
set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Stanger’s opinion
is directed to our board of directors, in its capacity as such, in connection with its consideration of the proposed terms
of the Management Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Summary of Materials Considered
In the course of Stanger’s analysis to render its opinion regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view,
to Bluerock Homes of the terms of the Management Agreement, Stanger: (i) reviewed a copy of a
Management Agreement Term Sheet setting forth the key terms of the Management Agreement (the “Term
Sheet”); (ii) reviewed a five-year projection model for the Bluerock Homes Business as prepared by
management of the Company; (iii) reviewed the financial terms of management agreements for 12 publicly
traded REITs (the “Publicly Traded Externally Advised REITs”); (iv) reviewed the financial terms of
management agreements for 15 non-traded REITs (the “Non-Traded Externally Advised REITs”); and (v)
conducted such other analyses as Stanger deemed appropriate.
Summary of Analyses
In preparing its opinion for the board of directors, Stanger performed a variety of analyses, including those
described below. In rendering the opinion, Stanger applied judgment to a variety of complex analyses and
assumptions. Stanger advised the board of directors that the preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process that involves various quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to
financial, comparative and other analytical methods and information and the application of these methods
and information to the unique facts and circumstances presented. Stanger arrived at its opinion based on the
results of all analyses undertaken and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from
or with regard to any individual analysis, analytic method or factor. The fact that any specific analysis is
referred to is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis.
Stanger made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of its reviews and analyses. The assumptions made and the judgments applied in
rendering the opinion are not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Accordingly,
Stanger advised the board of directors that its entire analysis must be considered as a whole, and that
selecting portions of its analyses, analytical methods and the factors considered without considering all
factors and analyses and assumptions, qualifications and limitations of each analysis would create an
incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying the opinion.
Stanger’s opinion was provided to the board of directors in connection with the board of directors’s
consideration of the financial terms in the Term Sheet and was one of several factors considered by the
board of directors in evaluating the Management Agreement. Neither Stanger’s opinion nor its analyses were
determinative of the terms of the Management Agreement or of the views of the board of directors. Below is
a summary of the material valuation analyses prepared in connection with Stanger’s opinion.
Overview of Reviews and Analyses
In conducting its reviews and analysis of the financial terms of the Term Sheet, Stanger considered, among
other things a comparable transactions analysis.
Stanger reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of management agreements for the following Publicly
Traded Externally Advised REITs and Non-Traded Externally Advised REITs.

Stanger observed that the management agreements for seven of the Publicly Traded Externally Advised
REITs provide for a performance fee based on FFO, AFFO or core earnings (the “Group A REITs”). Stanger
additionally observed that three of the management agreements for the Publicly Traded Externally Advised
REITs provide for a performance fee based on the total return of the REIT over a specified period in excess of
a defined peer average (the “Group B REITs”). Stanger also observed that two of the management
agreements for the Publicly Traded Externally Advised REITs do not provide for a performance fee (the
“Group C REITs”). The Non-Traded Externally Advised REITs are referred to herein as the “Group D REITs.”
A summary of the fee structures for the Publicly Traded Externally Advised REITs and Non-Traded Externally
Advised REITs (collectively, the “Management Agreement Comparables”) is set forth in the table below.

The annual base management fee per the Term Sheet is 1.50% of new stockholders’ equity, per annum, as
compared to: (i) 0.85% to 1.50% for the Group A REITs; (ii) 0.70% to 1.40% for the Group B REITs; (iii) 2.00%
to 2.50% for the Group C REITs; and (iv) 1.00% to 1.50% for the Group D REITs. Stanger

TABLE OF CONTENTS
observed that the annual base management fee per the Term Sheet is within the range of the annual base
management fees for the Management Agreement Comparables.
The annual incentive fee per the Term Sheet is 20% of AFFO after stockholders receive an 8.0% annual return
on equity with no manager incentive fee catch up as compared to: (i) 15.0% of FFO to 25.0% of Core Earnings
after a 5.0% to 19.7% stockholder return with no manager fee catch up for the Group A REITs; (ii) 5.0% to
12.0% of the excess return over a peer average with no manager fee catch up for the Group B REITs; (iii) no
incentive fee for the Group C REITs; and (iv) none to 12.50% of total return after a 5.0% to 7.0% stockholder
return with a 25.0% to 100.0% manager catch up for the Group D REITs. Stanger observed that the annual
incentive fee per the Term Sheet is within the range of the annual incentive fees for the Management
Agreement Comparables.
The Term Sheet does not include a disposition fee. The disposition fee for the Group A REITs range from
none to 15.0% of the cumulative net gain from the sale of investments. The management agreements for the
Group B REITs and the Group C REITs do not provide for a disposition fee and the Group D REITs provide
for a disposition fee ranging from none to 2.0%. Stanger observed that the absence of a disposition fee in
the Term Sheet is in line with the Management Agreement Comparables.
The Term Sheet provides for a termination fee of 3.0x the Base and Incentive Fees earned during the 12-
month period immediately preceding such termination as compared to: (i) 1.5x to 3.0x the Base and Incentive
Fees for the Group A REITs; (ii) 12.0x to 22.0x of the Manager’s earnings before interest, taxes and
depreciation (“EBITDA”) earned during the 12-month period immediately preceding such termination for the
Group B REITs; (iii) no termination fees are provided for in the management agreements of the Group C
REITs; and (iv) no termination fee to the recoupment of contingent deferred fees for the Group D REITs.
Stanger observed that the termination fee per the Term Sheet is within the range of the termination fees for
the Management Agreement Comparables.
The Term Sheet provides for an internalization fee formula of 2.75x the Base and Incentive Fees earned
during the 12-month period immediately preceding such internalization. Stanger estimated the proposed
internalization fee formula per the Term Sheet was the equivalent to an implied 4.6x to 5.5x EBITDA multiple
assuming a 40% to 50% expense ratio. The management agreements for the Group A REITs provided for an
internalization fee formula of 5.0x to 6.0x trailing 12-month EBITDA and the management agreements for the
Group B REITs, the Group C REITs and the Group D REITs do not provide an internalization fee formula.
Stanger additionally reviewed 65 precedent internalization transactions totaling over $7.6 billion (the
“Precedent Transactions”) and observed that the EBITDA multiple on the Precedent Transactions ranged
from 2.0x to 13.6x, had a median of 6.4x and an average of 7.0x. Stanger observed that the internalization fee
formula in the Term Sheet is within the range of the internalization fee formulas for the Management
Agreement Comparables and the Precedent Transactions.
The Term Sheet also provides for expense reimbursements to the Manager so that Bluerock Homes will pay
all of the costs and expenses of Bluerock Homes and will reimburse the Manager or its affiliates for
documented expenses of the Manager and its affiliates incurred on behalf of Bluerock Homes that are
reasonably necessary for the performance by the Manager of its duties and functions under the
Management Agreement, which may include Bluerock Homes’ pro rata portion of rent, telephone, utilities,
office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of the Manager and
its affiliates required for Bluerock Homes’ operations. The Term Sheet states that the Manager will be
responsible for the expenses related to any and all personnel of the Manager. The expense reimbursement
provisions of the Term Sheet are in line with the expense reimbursement provisions for the Management
Agreement Comparables.
Conclusions
Stanger concluded based upon its analysis and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations cited in its
written fairness opinion, and in reliance thereon, that as of the date of the fairness opinion the terms of the
Management Agreement are fair to Bluerock Homes, from a financial point of view. The issuance of the
fairness opinion was approved by Stanger’s fairness opinion committee.
64 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Assumptions
In conducting its review and rendering its opinion, Stanger assumed with the consent of the board of
directors that the terms of the Management Agreement will not, when executed, differ in any material respect
from the Term Sheet, including that the Management Agreement, when executed, will not require Bluerock
Homes to internalize Bluerock Homes at any time. In rendering its opinion, Stanger has been advised that it
may rely upon, and therefore relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness in all material respects of all financial and other information furnished or otherwise
communicated to Stanger by the Company.
Limitations and Qualifications
Stanger was not requested to, and therefore did not: (i) appraise the assets or liabilities of Bluerock Homes;
(ii) estimate or opine to the impact of the Management Agreement on the anticipated trading price of the
Bluerock Homes shares; (iii) make any recommendation to the Company with respect to whether or not to
adopt the Management Agreement or the impact, tax or otherwise, of adopting the Management Agreement;
(iv) express any opinion as to (a) the business decision to pursue the implementation of the Management
Agreement or alternatives to the Management Agreement; (b) the amount of expenses relating to the
Management Agreement; (c) any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters; or (d) any other aspect of the
Management Agreement other than the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Bluerock Homes of the
terms of the Management Agreement as set forth in the Term Sheet; or (v) opine as to the fairness of the
amount or the nature of any compensation or consideration to any officers, directors, or employees of any of
the Parties, or any class of such persons, relative to the compensation or consideration to be paid to the
stockholders of Company common stock pursuant to the separation and distribution.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Stanger advised the board of directors that Stanger’s entire analysis must
be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of Stanger’s analysis and the factors considered by
Stanger, without considering all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the evaluation
process underlying the opinion.
Compensation and Material Relationships
Stanger has been paid a fee of $250,000 in connection with this fairness opinion engagement. Stanger served
as financial advisor to the board of directors in connection with the board of directors’s review of the
financial terms of the Term Sheet. Stanger will also be reimbursed for certain out-of-pocket expenses,
including legal fees, and will be indemnified against liabilities arising under any applicable federal or state
law or otherwise related to or arising out of Stanger’s engagement or performance of its services to the
Company. Payment of the fairness opinion fee to Stanger was not dependent upon completion of any
transaction or upon the findings of Stanger with respect to fairness. Other than this fairness opinion
engagement, during the past two years preceding the date of its opinion, Stanger has not been engaged by
the Company.",56,73

In connection with the closing of the merger, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $800 million to
be paid to the holders of our Common Stock (assuming the cash exercise of all outstanding Company
Warrants), including holders of Company equity awards. As described under “The Merger Agreement - 
Treatment of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company Warrants and Equity Awards,” Parent will also cause
approximately $1.19 billion to be paid to the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock,
Series D Preferred Stock and Series T Preferred Stock, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to
and including the closing date. In addition, Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the
merger, Parent expects to cause the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities to be
prepaid in full and our mortgage loans will be repaid or remain outstanding. As of December 31, 2021,
nothing was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and we had approximately $1.37 billion in
mortgage loans outstanding.

Parent has informed us that it is currently in the process of obtaining debt financing to be provided in
connection with the merger. In addition, it is expected that Blackstone will contribute equity to Parent for the
purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such
debt financing.
Parent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained
from the debt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of
our existing debt, paying carrying costs with respect to the properties, funding working capital requirements,
and for other costs and expenses related to the financing and the merger. Parent has informed us that it
currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the debt financing would be secured by, among other
things, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or ground leased by us, the direct
and/or indirect equity interests in certain entities which own certain properties, certain escrows and reserves
and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the
applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the merger being completed and
other customary conditions for similar financings.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, we have agreed to deliver, or we have agreed to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any joint venture to deliver, promptly following Parent’s request, a notice
prepared by Parent, in form and substance reasonably approved by us, to each of the lenders under our
existing mortgage indebtedness requesting that such lender consent to, among other things, the
consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to certain
modifications of the existing loan documents reasonably requested by Parent. Pursuant to the merger
agreement, we have also agreed to deliver customary prepayment and/or defeasance notices to the extent
requested by Parent.
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of
the merger. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement - Financing Cooperation” and “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to the Merger.”",73,74

In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to vote in favor of the proposal to approve the
merger, holders of our Common Stock should be aware that our directors and executive officers have
interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of holders of our Common
Stock generally. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other
matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to determine and
declare the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, to be advisable and in
the best interests of the Company and our stockholders and to approve the execution, delivery and
performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and
to resolve to recommend that the holders of Common Stock approve the merger.
These interests include:
continued employment with an affiliate of the Manager for Bluerock Homes for all our executive
officers other than Michael L. Konig;
accelerated vesting of certain Company long-term incentive plan units;
eligibility to receive certain employment payments; and
for a holder of limited partnership interests in our operating partnership, an increased ownership
percentage in the Bluerock Homes Business following the separation and the distribution relative to
holders of our Common Stock who do not hold limited partnership interests in our operating
partnership.
The foregoing interests are described in further detail below.
Our executive officers who are named executive officers (the “named executive officers”) for purposes of the
discussion below are R. Ramin Kamfar (Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer), Jordan B. Ruddy
(Chief Operating Officer and President), James G. Babb, III (Chief Strategy Officer),

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Ryan S. MacDonald (Chief Investment Officer), Christopher J. Vohs (Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer)
and Michael L. Konig (Chief Legal Officer and Secretary).
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards
Our executive officers hold vested and unvested long-term incentive plan units (“LTIP Units”) in our
operating partnership. Unvested LTIP Units are subject to time and/or performance-based vesting
requirements and may convert into units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership (“OP
Units”) upon reaching capital account equivalency with the OP Units held by the Company, and may then be
redeemed for cash or, at the option of the Company, settled in shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one
basis.
Immediately prior to the effective time of the distribution:
outstanding and unvested time-based LTIP Units will vest in full; and
outstanding and unvested performance-based LTIP Units will vest based on the level of achievement
of the applicable performance goals calculated through the latest practicable date prior to the
effective time of the distribution, pro-rated to reflect the truncated performance period, and any
portion of such unvested performance-based LTIP Units that do not so vest will be forfeited.
No LTIP Units held by our executive officers (other than those held by Mr. Konig) will be cashed out in
connection with the merger and our operating partnership will be controlled by Bluerock Homes following
the separation and the distribution. Following the merger effective time, the vested LTIP Units held by our
executive officers (other than those held by Mr. Konig) will continue to be eligible to convert to common
units of the operating partnership upon reaching capital account equivalency with common units in the
operating partnership, and may then be redeemed for cash or, at the option of Bluerock Homes, settled in
shares of Class A common stock of Bluerock Homes.
In the case of Mr. Konig, who is not expected to continue his employment with Bluerock Homes after the
merger effective time, his vested LTIP Units will convert into shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis
prior to the record date for the distribution and each share of Common Stock so converted that is
outstanding as of the merger effective time will become entitled to receive (x) the per share dividend of
Bluerock Homes common stock and (y) the merger consideration. See the section entitled “- Quantification of
Potential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” for an
estimate of the value and benefits described above that would become payable to each of our named
executive officers in respect of their LTIP Units. The estimated aggregate amounts that would become
payable at the merger effective time to the executive officer who is not a named executive officer is as
follows: unvested LTIP Units - $943,824 (based on estimated performance and proration assuming the merger
effective time occurs on March 7, 2022, and using a per unit price of $26.60, the average closing price of
Common Stock on the first five trading days following public announcement of the merger).
All of the LTIP Units held by our non-employee directors are fully vested at the time of grant pursuant to
their terms.
None of our executive officers or directors owns any awards of restricted Common Stock.
Employment Payments
The Company has entered into employment agreements with each of its executive officers (collectively, the
“Employment Agreements”). The Employment Agreements provide certain cash severance benefits upon a
termination of employment by the Company without “cause,” or a resignation by the executive officer for
“good reason,” subject to such executive officer’s execution of a general release.
The severance benefits under each Employment Agreement, if such termination or resignation occurs on or
within 18 months following a change in control of the Company (or, in the case of Mr. Kamfar, with or
without a change in control), are:
cash severance equal to three times (or in the case of the executive officer who is not a named
executive officer, one times) the sum of the executive officer’s (x) annual base salary in effect at the
67 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
time of termination and (y) the average of the annual bonuses paid to him with respect to the two
completed calendar years prior to the year in which the employment termination occurs;
a prorated target annual bonus for the year of termination; and
the executive officer’s COBRA premium under our group health plans during the executive officer’s
COBRA continuation period (together with the cash severance and pro-rated annual bonus described
above, the “Employment Payments”).
Under the merger agreement, each executive officer is entitled to the Employment Payment at the merger
effective time (upon which time each executive officer’s employment with the Company will terminate),
subject to (i) the executive officer’s continuous employment with the Company (or a subsidiary) through the
merger effective time, (ii) the executive officer’s execution of a customary release of claims in favor of the
Company and Bluerock Homes and (iii) an aggregate cap for all Employment Payments (and to the extent the
Employment Payments would otherwise exceed such cap, the Employment Payments for each applicable
individual will be reduced pro rata).
Except as described below, the Employment Payments will be an obligation of the Company. Under the
merger agreement, if any executive officer waives the Company’s obligation with respect to his Employment
Payment, (i) Bluerock Homes will instead assume such obligation, and (ii) the cash that the Company will
contribute to Bluerock Homes immediately prior to the effective time of the distribution will be increased by
the amount of such Employment Payment, as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - The
Separation and the Distribution”. As of the date of this proxy statement, no executive officer has waived, or
is expected to waive, the Company’s obligation to pay any Employment Payment.
Each Employment Agreement provides that for the one-year period following the termination of the executive
officer’s employment or its service relationship with the Company for any reason (which will occur upon the
consummation of the merger), he will not solicit our employees or exclusive consultants or independent
contractors, and for the eighteen-month period following the termination of his employment with us for any
reason, each executive officer will not solicit our investors or customers or compete with us.
See the section entitled “- Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers
in Connection with the Merger” of this proxy statement for the estimated amounts of the Employment
Payments that each of our named executive officers would be entitled to receive upon the consummation the
merger, assuming the merger effective time occurs on March 7, 2022. The estimated aggregate amount of the
Employment Payment paid in cash to the executive officer who is not a named executive officer is $703,088.
Cash Retention Program
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company may grant cash retention awards with an aggregate
value of up to $1.5 million, with any awards to be paid in full immediately prior to the merger effective time.
Amounts under this cash retention program will be allocated among our employees who are identified, and in
the amounts and on the terms determined, by our Chief Executive Officer. As of the date of this proxy
statement, no cash retention awards have been, or are expected to be, granted to any of our executive
officers.
Continued Relationship with Bluerock Homes
Following the consummation of the merger, our executive officers will cease to serve as executive officers or
employees of the Company, and, with the exception of Mr. Konig, will hold the same roles at Bluerock Homes
and its Manager as they currently hold at the Company. Although they will not receive compensation from
Bluerock Homes, as executive officers, they will be eligible to receive Bluerock Homes equity awards, the
amounts and vesting terms of which will be determined by the board of directors of Bluerock Homes. In
addition, certain of our executive officers will have ownership interests in the Manager of Bluerock Homes.
In connection with the separation and the distribution, the operating partnership (which will be controlled by
Bluerock Homes following the separation and the distribution) will create new series of LTIPs
68 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
and common units (“C-LTIPs” and “C-common units,” respectively). C-LTIPs will be issued by the operating
partnership to the Manager of Bluerock Homes pursuant to the Management Agreement. One half of each
quarterly installment of each of the base management fee and the incentive fee under the Management
Agreement will be payable in C-LTIPs. The remainder of each of the management fee and the incentive fee
will be payable in cash or in C-LTIPs, at the election of the board of directors of Bluerock Homes. Additional
C-LTIPs will also be issuable to the executive officers of Bluerock Homes or other service providers of
Bluerock Homes at the discretion of the board of directors of Bluerock Homes.
C-LTIPs, subject to (1) vesting in accordance with their terms and (2) achievement of capital account
equivalency with common units in the operating partnership, may, at the option of the holder, be converted
into C-common units. C-common units will be redeemable at the option of the holder, and the operating
partnership may elect to settle any such redemption in cash or Class C common stock of Bluerock Homes.
The terms of Class C common stock are further described below. However, Class C common stock of
Bluerock Homes will not be issuable on redemption of other common units in the operating partnership
(which will be redeemable for cash or Class A common stock of Bluerock Homes at the election of the
operating partnership), including those outstanding prior to the separation and the distribution.
Following the consummation of the merger, our directors will cease to serve as the directors of the Company
and will become the directors of Bluerock Homes. The non-employee directors of Bluerock Homes will be
compensated for their board service as determined by the Bluerock Homes board of directors.
Ownership of Bluerock Homes Immediately Following the Distribution
As of the record date, our executive officers and directors or their respective affiliates held approximately
818,724 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company, 72,964 shares of the Class C Common Stock of the
Company, 5,646,435 OP Units and 5,262,426 LTIP Units, representing in the aggregate an approximate 29.09%
direct and indirect interest in the operating partnership.
All of our executive officers, other than Mr. Konig, along with certain entities related to them, have agreed to
retain their interests in the operating partnership until the earlier of the merger effective time and the
termination of the merger agreement, rather than redeeming their interests for cash or shares of Common
Stock. Holders of OP Units and LTIP Units, including our executive officers and their related entities, who do
not redeem those interests for Common Stock prior to the record date for the distribution will not receive any
of the merger consideration in respect of their interests in the operating partnership and will instead continue
to hold their interests in the operating partnership following the separation and distribution.
In the distribution, holders of our Class C Common Stock will receive shares of Class C common stock of
Bluerock Homes in the same ratio that shares of Class A common stock of Bluerock Homes will be distributed
in respect of shares of our Class A Common Stock. Each share of Bluerock Homes Class C common stock will
entitle its holder to up to 50 votes, whereas each share of Bluerock Homes Class A common stock will entitle
its holder to 1 vote. However, no holder of Bluerock Homes Class C common stock will be entitled to a
number of votes in respect of its shares of Bluerock Homes Class C common stock that exceeds the number
of shares of Bluerock Homes Class C common stock, C-LTIPs, LTIPs, C-common units and other common
units in the operating partnership beneficially owned by such holder. Consequently, no holder of Bluerock
Homes Class C common stock will be entitled to a number of votes in excess of the number of its direct and
indirect economic interests in the operating partnership.
As a result of the separation and the distribution, including the consummation of the Exchange in
connection therewith, our executive officers and directors are expected to have an indirect ownership interest
of approximately 65% in the Bluerock Homes Business through their ownership of Bluerock Homes Class A
and Class C common stock and their continued ownership in the operating partnership (which will be
controlled by Bluerock Homes following the separation and distribution). See the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement - The Separation and the Distribution” for more information regarding the separation and
the distribution, including the Exchange.
As described in the section entitled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”, the
receipt of cash by the holders of our Common Stock pursuant to the merger, taken together with the
69 
(1) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
shares of Bluerock Homes common stock to be received by them in the distribution, is expected to be treated
as a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, the holders of OP Units and
LTIP Units, including our executive officers and their related entities (other than Mr. Konig), are generally
not expected to recognize taxable gain in respect of their OP Units and LTIP Units as such OP Units and LTIP
Units will be retained and not cashed out in connection with the separation and the distribution or the
merger.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, our non-employee directors and executive officers will be
entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policies following the merger.
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-
K, which requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of
the Company that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. For additional details regarding the terms
of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption “- Interests of Our
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” above.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the
footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of
the merger. The disclosure below assumes that the merger effective time occurs on March 7, 2022.

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to
U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each, as defined below) of shares of Common Stock whose shares are
exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger and of shares of Preferred Stock whose shares are redeemed for
cash in connection with the merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”), each, as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to
differing interpretations and may change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or
differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this
discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a
position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. We have not sought and will not seek an
advance ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this section. This summary assumes that the
distribution and the merger will be consummated in accordance with the merger agreement, the separation
and distribution agreement contemplated by the merger agreement and as described in this proxy statement.
This discussion is not a complete description of all tax consequences of the merger and, in particular, does
not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to
the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, any withholding considerations pursuant to the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations and administrative
guidance thereunder and the intergovernmental agreements entered into, and laws and regulations
promulgated, pursuant thereto or in connection therewith) nor does it address any tax considerations under
state, local or non-U.S. laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock
or shares of Preferred Stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

a trust (1) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which
has one or more “United States persons”  (as defined under the Code) who have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable
U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Common
Stock or shares of Preferred Stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders of shares of Common Stock or shares of
Preferred Stock who hold such shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment). This discussion also does not address any U.S. federal income tax
consequences to holders who purchase or sell their shares of Common Stock between the record date for the
distribution and the date on which the distribution is effected. Further, this discussion is for general
information purposes only and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, and it does not apply
to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example:
insurance companies;
dealers, brokers or traders in securities or currencies;
traders in securities who elect to apply the mark-to-market method of accounting;
broker-dealers;
persons acting as nominees or otherwise not as beneficial owners;
holders subject to the alternative minimum tax;
persons who are required to recognize income or gain no later than such income or gain is required to
be reported on an applicable financial statement;
U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;
tax-exempt entities and organizations;
retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred or advantaged accounts (or
persons holding shares of Common Stock or shares of Preferred Stock through such plans or
accounts);

It is expected that the distribution and the merger will be treated as part of a prearranged, integrated plan for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and that, for such purposes, the distribution and the merger will be viewed
together as (i) the adoption by the Company of a plan of liquidation, (ii) a sale by the Company of a portion
of its assets to Merger Sub (or, if applicable, its regarded owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes), and
(iii) a distribution by the Company of the shares of Bluerock Homes common stock distributed in the
distribution, and of the cash consideration payable in connection with the merger to the holders of shares of
Common Stock and shares of Preferred Stock, in complete liquidation of the Company. The remainder of this
discussion assumes that the distribution and the merger will be treated as described above.
There can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the treatment of the distribution and the merger
described above. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this treatment, it is possible that the distribution
would instead be treated as a taxable distribution separate from the deemed liquidation of the Company
pursuant to the merger. In such case, the value of the Bluerock Homes common stock distributed in the
distribution would not be considered part of the merger consideration. In addition, although the Company
will ascribe a value to the shares of the Bluerock Homes common stock distributed in the distribution, this
valuation is not binding on the IRS or any other taxing authority. These taxing authorities could ascribe a
higher valuation to the distributed Bluerock Homes common stock, particularly if, following the distribution,
those shares trade at prices significantly above the value ascribed to those shares by the Company. Such a
higher valuation may affect the distribution amount and thus the tax consequences of the distribution and
the merger to stockholders.",81,81

The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the merger, taken
together with the distribution, is expected to be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation of the
Company and a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of
shares of Common Stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of (A) the amount of cash received with respect to such
U.S. holder’s shares of Common Stock in the merger, plus (B) the fair market value, determined when the
distribution occurs, of the shares of Bluerock Homes common stock received in the distribution, and (2) the
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Common Stock.
73 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of Common Stock at different times and different prices,
such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with
respect to each block of shares of Common Stock. Any such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss
and will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Common Stock
surrendered in the merger is greater than one year at the time of the distribution and the merger. Long-term
capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for reduced rates
of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
A U.S. holder who has held shares of Common Stock for less than six months at the time of the merger (and
the distribution), taking into account the holding period rules of Sections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and
who recognizes a loss on the exchange of such shares of Common Stock in the merger (and the distribution)
will be treated as recognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received
from us, or such holder’s share of any designated retained capital gains, with respect to such shares.",81,82

General
The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of distributions and payments made with
respect to such non-U.S. holder’s shares of Common Stock in connection with the merger (and the
distribution) will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt of such distributions and
payments are treated as distributions from the Company that are attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs
pursuant to the provisions of FIRPTA. The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it intends to take the
position that under current law a non-U.S. holder’s receipt of a liquidating distribution from a REIT
(including distributions and payments made in connection with the distribution and the merger, which as
noted, are expected to be treated as distributions in complete liquidation of the Company for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) is generally subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to the extent attributable to
gain from the sale of USRPIs. Although legislation effectively overriding Notice 2007-55 has previously been
proposed, it is not possible to say if or when any such legislation will be enacted. Accordingly, we intend to
take the position that distributions and payments made with respect the Company’s shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the merger (and the distribution) will be subject to tax in accordance with Notice 2007-55, subject
to the 10% Exception, as described in more detail below. In general, the provisions governing the taxation of
distributions by REITs can be less favorable to non-U.S. holders than the taxation of sales or exchanges of
REIT stock by non-U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
application of these provisions.
Distribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests
To the extent that the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and the 10% Exception described in
the next paragraph below does not apply, then, to the extent that distributions and payments received by a
non-U.S. holder with respect to such non-U.S. holder’s Common Stock pursuant to the merger (and the
distribution) are treated as attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of Bluerock Residential’s
USRPIs, such amounts will be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the
non-U.S. holder, and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis. A corporate non-U.S.
holder will also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an
applicable income tax treaty). In addition, 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in the Treasury Regulations) of
any such amounts paid to a non-U.S. holder will be withheld and remitted to the IRS.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of Common Stock are considered “regularly traded”  (within the
meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations) on an established securities market located in the United
States and the non-U.S. holder did not hold more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the one-
year period ending on the date of the merger (and the distribution), the tax treatment and consequences
described above would not apply (the “10% Exception”), and non-U.S. holders would instead be subject to
the rules described below under “- Taxable Sale of Common Stock.” We believe that shares of our Class A
Common Stock are, and will be at the time of the merger (and the distribution), considered regularly traded on
an established securities market located in the United States within the meaning of the applicable
74 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Treasury Regulations. Bluerock Residential Class C Common Stock are not, and will not be at the time of the
merger (and the distribution), considered regularly traded on an established securities market located in the
United States. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding tax consequences of the merger
(and the distribution) to them.
Taxable Sale of Common Stock
If both (A) the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 were not to apply to a non-U.S. holder’s receipt of
distributions and payments with respect to such non-U.S. holder’s shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
merger (and the distribution) and (B) either (1) the “publicly traded exception”  (as described below) applies
or (2) we are a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity”  (as described below), such that the
Company’s shares of Common Stock do not constitute USRPIs under FIRPTA with respect to such non-U.S.
holder, then the non-U.S. holder should not be subject to tax on any gain recognized in connection with the
receipt of cash consideration payable pursuant to the merger (which, as described above under “-
Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock” and subject to the discussion of
Notice 2007-55 above, is generally expected to be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation of the
Company and, together with the receipt of shares of Bluerock Homes common stock pursuant to the
distribution, as amounts received in full payment in exchange for such holder’s shares of Common Stock)
unless: (a) the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the
United States, or, if required pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty, the gain is attributable to a
permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States; or (b) the non-U.S. holder
is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger (and the
distribution) and certain other requirements are met.
The “publicly traded exception” applies to a non-U.S. holder if our Common Stock is “regularly traded,” as
defined by the applicable Treasury Regulations, and the non-U.S. holder has held 10% or less of the shares
of Common Stock at all times during the shorter of the period that the non-U.S. holder owned such stock or
the five-year period ending on the date of the merger (and the distribution). We believe that shares of our
Class A Common Stock are, and will be at the time of the merger (and the distribution), considered regularly
traded on an established securities market located in the United States within the meaning of the applicable
Treasury Regulations. Bluerock Residential Class C Common Stock are not, and will not be at the time of the
merger (and the distribution), considered regularly traded on an established securities market located in the
United States.
We will be a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the time of the merger (and the
distribution) if non-U.S. holders held directly or indirectly less than 50% in value of shares of Common Stock
at all times during the five-year period ending with the merger (and the distribution). While we believe that
the Company has been and currently is domestically controlled as of the date hereof, no assurances can be
given that the actual ownership of shares of Common Stock has been or will be sufficient for us to qualify as
a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the time of the merger (and the distribution).
A non-U.S. holder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United
States (or, if an applicable income tax treaty requires, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained
by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain
on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be
subject to the branch profits tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable
income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described above.
A non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year
of the merger (and the distribution) and who meets certain other requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax
on the gain recognized in connection with the merger (and the distribution), which may be offset by certain
U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder.
If a non-U.S. holder’s shares of Common Stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by
such holder on a sale of such stock will be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or
business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net

The redemption of shares of Preferred Stock will be treated as a taxable transaction. The U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the redemption to holders of shares of Preferred Stock generally will be the same as the
consequences to holders of shares of our Common Stock described above with respect to the merger, except
that the capital gain or loss recognized by a holder of shares of Preferred Stock will be measured by the
difference between the amount of cash the holder receives in connection with the redemption of shares of
Preferred Stock and such holder’s adjusted tax basis in shares of Preferred Stock. Consistent with IRS Notice
2007-55 (described above), and without limiting any of the above discussion, 21% (or 20% to the extent
provided in U.S. Treasury Regulations) of any cash received by a non-U.S. holder in the redemption, which is
treated as a distribution attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of our USRPIs, will be withheld
and remitted to the IRS unless such holder qualifies for the 10% Exception discussed above.",84,84

Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to distributions and payments made in connection
with the merger (and the distribution). Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a holder of shares of
Common Stock or shares of Preferred Stock who (1) in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer
identification number, certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on an IRS Form W-9,
and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; (2) in the case of a

Common Stock
At the merger effective time, each share of our Common Stock (other than the cancelled shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be automatically converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration. If we declare a dividend reasonably determined by us to be required to
maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid or reduce the payment of income or excise tax or
any other entity-level tax as permitted under the merger agreement, the merger consideration will be
decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend.
Preferred Stock
After the date this proxy statement is mailed to our stockholders, we will deliver to the holders of record of
our Preferred Stock a notice of redemption for each applicable series of Preferred Stock that complies in all
material respects with the specifications and timing requirements of our organizational documents. The
notice of redemption will state that the redemption of our Preferred Stock will be effective as of, and
conditioned upon the occurrence of, the merger effective time at the applicable redemption amount as
described in the following paragraph. The redemption notices will be prepared by us and be reasonably
acceptable to Parent.
At or prior to the merger effective time, Parent, on behalf of the surviving company, will irrevocably set aside
and deposit in trust for the benefit of the holders of our Preferred Stock cash equal to the Preferred Stock
redemption amount: (i) $25.00, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the
redemption date, without interest, per share of Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series T
Preferred Stock, and (ii) $1,000.00, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends to and including
the redemption date, without interest, per share of Series B Preferred Stock. We and Parent will give
irrevocable instructions, effective as of the merger effective time, for the payment of the Preferred Stock
redemption amount.
Company Warrants
At least ten (10) business days prior to the merger effective time, we will notify the warrant agent in
accordance with the warrant agreements that, as of the merger effective time, each share of our Class A
Common Stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive the merger consideration and that the
terms of the warrant agreements will be adjusted so that the holder of any Company Warrant exercised after
the merger effective time will be entitled to receive in cash the merger consideration that the holder would
have received if the Company Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the closing date.
Restricted Stock Awards
At the merger effective time, each restricted stock award that is outstanding immediately prior to the merger
effective time will be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (1) the

other than the right to receive the merger consideration without interest upon the surrender of such
certificate or book-entry share in accordance with the merger agreement, and our stock transfer books will be
closed with respect to all shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective

shares will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in the merger agreement.",88,88

Prior to the closing, Parent will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to us to act as paying
agent for the payment of the merger consideration, and will enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably
acceptable to us relating to the paying agent’s responsibilities under the merger agreement. At or prior to the
merger effective time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the paying agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of shares of our Common Stock (other than cancelled shares), cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate merger consideration. As promptly as practicable (and no later than the fifth business day)
after the merger effective time, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each holder
of record of one or more certificates or book-entry shares representing shares of our Common Stock that
were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the certificates or book-entry shares, as the case may be, in exchange for the merger
consideration, and to each holder of a certificate a letter of transmittal in customary form that will specify
that delivery will be effected and risk of loss and title to the certificates will pass only upon proper delivery
of the certificate to the paying agent.
Each holder of record of one or more certificates, upon surrender to the paying agent of such certificates,
together with such letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent
or the paying agent, and each holder of record of book-entry shares, upon surrender to the paying agent of
such book-entry shares (which shall be deemed surrendered upon receipt by the paying agent of an “agent’s
message” in customary form or such other evidence as the paying agent may reasonably request), will be
entitled to receive the merger consideration payable in respect of the shares of our Common Stock
previously represented thereby, and the certificates and book-entry shares surrendered will be cancelled. If a
transfer of ownership of our Common Stock is not registered in our transfer records, payment of the merger
consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the certificate or book-entry
share is registered if such certificate or book-entry share is properly endorsed or otherwise in a proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment will pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the transfer or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of certificates or book-entry
shares.
We, the surviving company, Parent, Merger Sub and the paying agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable pursuant to the merger agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable tax law. To the extent that any
amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority, such deducted or
withheld amounts will be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.
Subject to applicable law, neither we, Parent, the surviving company, Merger Sub nor the paying agent, nor
any employee, officer, director, manager, member, agent or affiliate thereof, will be liable to any person

Under the merger agreement, we are required, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date that this
proxy statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to holders of our Common Stock, to set a record date for,
duly give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of our stockholders for the purpose of seeking
stockholder approval of the merger. We are required to (1) recommend to holders of Common Stock that they
vote in favor of the merger so that we may obtain the approval of the merger and (2) use our reasonable best
efforts to obtain approval of the merger by holders of our Common Stock (including by soliciting proxies
from our stockholders), unless, in each case, our board of directors has made an adverse recommendation
change, as permitted by the merger agreement and described below under “- No Solicitation.”
We have agreed to cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding our
solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of this proxy statement. We may adjourn or
postpone the special meeting after consultation with Parent:
to the extent reasonably necessary to allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental
or amended disclosure document that our board of directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, is required to be filed and disseminated under applicable law;
if as of the time that the special meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of our
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the special meeting; or
if we reasonably determine in good faith that additional time is required to solicit proxies in favor of
the approval of the merger, provided that, in the case of this bullet point and the one immediately
above, the special meeting may not be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date for
which the special meeting was originally scheduled without the prior written consent of Parent.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of the merger will be the only matter (other than
matters of procedure and matters required by applicable law to be voted on by our stockholders in
connection with the approval of the merger) that we will propose to be acted on by our stockholders at the
special meeting and we will not submit to the vote of our stockholders any company takeover proposal.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “company takeover proposal” means any bona fide proposal or offer
made by any person or “group”  (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent and
its affiliates), and whether involving a transaction or series of related transactions, for:
a merger, share exchange, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction to which we are
a constituent entity;
the direct or indirect acquisition, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of equity interests, share
exchange, joint venture, business combination or otherwise, pursuant to which any person or
“group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent and its affiliates), or
the direct or indirect stockholders thereof, acquires or would acquire beneficial ownership (as defined
in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), of more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our Common
Stock (or equity of the resulting company) or more than 15% of the outstanding voting power of all of
our Common Stock (or voting power of the resulting company), in either case of this bullet point, then
issued and outstanding (including through the acquisition of options, rights or warrants to purchase,
or securities convertible into or exchangeable or redeemable for such shares of our Common Stock or
equity of the resulting company) including any Company Warrants or common units; or
any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer, disposition or similar transaction, whether by
merger, consolidation, sale of equity interests, share exchange, joint venture, business combination or
otherwise, pursuant to which any Person or “group”  (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act) (other than Parent and its affiliates), or the direct or indirect stockholders thereof, acquires or
would acquire more than 15% of our and our subsidiaries’ assets (after giving effect to the

secured solely by such assets).
Unless we have made a company adverse recommendation change to the extent permitted by the merger
agreement, we will ensure that our board of directors directs any excess shares to be voted in favor of
approval of the merger at the special meeting. Unless the merger agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, our obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the special meeting
and mail this proxy statement (and any amendment or supplement to this proxy statement that may be
required by law) to our stockholders will not be affected by a company adverse recommendation change.",97,98

Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
will, and will cause each of our respective subsidiaries to, use our reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under the
merger agreement and applicable laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement as soon as reasonably possible after the date of the merger agreement, including:
using reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to cause the
conditions to closing set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied;
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documents to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, authorizations, approvals and permits in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary or desirable to make all necessary filings and obtain
all such consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, authorizations, approvals and
permits, including providing all necessary information and documentary material and providing
personnel as necessary to attend any regulatory meetings, hearings or other proceedings; and
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the
merger agreement or the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any
court or other governmental entity vacated or reversed, and using reasonable best efforts to avoid
each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition, trade regulation or other
law that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the merger so as to enable the
consummation to occur as soon as reasonably possible.
In connection with obtaining any consents in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement from any person (1) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of us or any of our
subsidiaries (after giving effect to the separation) will pay or commit to pay to such person whose approval
or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation, (2) none of Parent or any of its affiliates will be required to pay or commit to pay to such
person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment
or incur any liability, and (3) neither us nor our subsidiaries will be required to pay or commit to pay to such
person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment
or incur any liability, except, in each case of this clause (3), if the payment, commitment or obligation is
conditioned upon the closing.
We, Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause each of our respective subsidiaries to obtain all requisite
approvals, clearances and authorizations for the transactions contemplated hereby, use our reasonable best
efforts to:
cooperate in all respects with each party in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by any private
party;

contemplated hereby and promptly inform the other parties of any communication received by such

Upon the execution of the merger agreement, we agreed to (1) immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any person, other than Parent and Merger Sub,
that may be ongoing with respect to any company takeover proposal, (2) request that each person, other
than Parent, its controlled affiliates and their respective representatives, that has executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with any company takeover proposal promptly return or destroy all non-public
information concerning us or our subsidiaries (after giving effect to the separation) furnished to such person
by or on behalf of us or any of our subsidiaries prior to the date of the merger agreement, and (3) terminate
any data room access of, or provision of other diligence materials to, each such person and their
representatives.
We have further agreed that in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and subject to the
provisions described below, we will not, and we will cause our subsidiaries and our and our subsidiaries’
officers and directors not to, and will instruct our and our subsidiaries’ employees, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, investment bankers, advisors, financing sources, representatives or authorized agents not to,
directly or indirectly:
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any proposal or offer, or any inquiries or
requests regarding the making of any proposal or offer, including any proposal or offer to our
stockholders, that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a company takeover
proposal; or
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any other person any information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
a company takeover proposal.
We have further agreed we will not, and will cause our subsidiaries not to, release any third party from, or
waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill or confidentiality
provision with respect to a company takeover proposal or similar matter in any agreement to which we are a
party; provided that, if our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
91 • 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be inconsistent with the directors’ duties
under applicable law, we may grant a limited waiver of any standstill provision solely to the extent necessary
to permit a third party to make a non-public company takeover proposal to our board of directors and, to the
extent permitted by the merger agreement, thereafter negotiate and enter into any transaction in connection
therewith.
Prior to the approval of the merger by holders of our Common Stock, if we receive a bona fide written
company takeover proposal that did not result from a breach of the obligations described in “- No
Solicitation” and as described below in “- Obligation of the Board of Directors with Respect to Its
Recommendation,” and our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such company takeover proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a company superior proposal, then we and our representatives
may:
furnish, pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, information with respect to us and our
subsidiaries to the person that has made such company takeover proposal and its representatives;
and
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
company takeover proposal and its representatives regarding such company takeover proposal.
If we take any of the actions described in the two bullet points above, we will promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing.
We will notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours) after receipt of any company takeover
proposal or any initial request for non-public information regarding us or any of our subsidiaries from any
person that informs us or our representatives that it is considering making, or has made, a company takeover
proposal, or any other initial inquiry from any person regarding a possible company takeover proposal. Such
notice will identify the person making such company takeover proposal or inquiry and the material terms and
conditions of any company takeover proposals or inquiries. We will also promptly (and in any event within
48 hours) after the receipt thereof, provide to Parent copies of any written company takeover proposals or
inquiries, including any written documentation (including drafts of proposed agreements) relating thereto
and will notify Parent of any change to the financial and other material terms and material conditions of such
company takeover proposal promptly (and in any event within 48 hours), including by providing a copy of
all written proposals, offers, drafts of proposed agreements or correspondence relating thereto. We will
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provide to Parent any non-public information concerning us or
our subsidiaries that is provided to any other person in connection with any company takeover proposal
that was not previously provided to Parent. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may, after the date of the
merger agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit us from providing
such information to Parent.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “company superior proposal” means a written company takeover
proposal (except that each reference to “15%” in the definition of “company takeover proposal” will be
replaced by “50%”) that our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with our
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (1) would result, if consummated, in a transaction
that is more favorable to our stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (2) is reasonably likely to be consummated,
after taking into account such factors that our board of directors considers to be appropriate (e.g., the
timing, likelihood of consummation, legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the company takeover
proposal, including the financing terms thereof) and any changes to the terms of the merger agreement
proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent.
In addition, the merger agreement provides that we and our board of directors will not take any action to
exempt any person, other than Parent, Merger Sub or their affiliates, from or render inapplicable:
the “aggregate share ownership limit” or the “common share ownership limit”  (including by
establishing or increasing an “excepted holder limit,” in each case, as such terms are defined in our
organizational documents); or

Except in the circumstances and pursuant to the procedures described below, neither our board of directors
nor any committee thereof will:
change, withhold, qualify or withdraw, in each case, in any manner adverse to Parent, the company
recommendation (or resolve or publicly propose to do so);
approve, adopt or recommend to our stockholders a company takeover proposal (or resolve or
publicly propose to do so);
fail to include the company recommendation in this proxy statement (each of the first three bullet

of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture

considering making, or has made, a company takeover proposal (or any representative of such
person) relating to, or any agreement, providing for, a company takeover proposal (other than an
acceptable confidentiality agreement).
Prior to the approval of the merger by holders of our Common Stock, our board of directors may make a
company adverse recommendation change in response to an intervening event if, prior to taking such action,
the board of directors has determined, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the duties of our board
of directors under applicable law; provided that prior to making such company adverse recommendation
change:
we have given Parent prior written notice of our intention to take such action specifying, in
reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, including a description in reasonable detail of the intervening
event;
during the four (4) business day period following Parent’s receipt of the notice referenced in the
bullet point immediately above (the “notice of intervening event period”), we will, and will cause our

negotiate with Parent in good faith (if Parent requests to negotiate) with respect to such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement as are proposed in writing by Parent; and
upon the end of the notice of intervening event period, our board of directors has considered any
revisions to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a company
adverse recommendation change would still reasonably be inconsistent with the duties of our board
of directors under applicable law if such revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect.
Prior to the approval of the merger by holders of our Common Stock, if we have not breached our obligations
described in this “- Obligation of the Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation” and our board
of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that an unsolicited bona fide written company takeover proposal (that did

TABLE OF CONTENTS
not result from a breach from the Company’s obligations described in “- No Solicitation” or this “- Obligation
of the Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation”) constitutes a company superior proposal,
then our board of directors may (A) make a company adverse recommendation change and/or (B) cause us to
terminate the merger agreement in accordance with its terms in order to substantially concurrently enter into
a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such company superior proposal; provided that
prior to making a company adverse recommendation change or terminating the merger agreement:
we have given Parent prior written notice of our intention to take such action, including the material
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any such company superior proposal
and have contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the company superior proposal and a
copy of any proposed agreements relating thereto;
during the four (4) business day period following Parent’s receipt of the notice referred to in the
bullet point above (the “match period”), we will, and will cause each of our officers to, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause each of our other representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (if Parent requests to negotiate) with respect to such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
the merger agreement as are proposed in writing by Parent;
at the end of such match period, our board of directors has considered any revisions to the terms of
the merger agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and has determined in good faith, after
consultation with our independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the company
superior proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a company superior proposal if such
revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect; and
in the event of any change to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such company
superior proposal, we will, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with
that described in the first bullet point above and a new match period under the second bullet point
above will commence during which time we will be required to comply with the requirements
described by this bullet point and the three bullet points above anew with respect to such additional
notice; provided, further, that any such new match period will be a period of two (2) business days
following receipt by Parent of any such additional notice.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “intervening event” means a material change, event, circumstance,
occurrence or development that (a) was unknown to (or, if known, the material consequences of which were
not known or reasonably foreseeable by) our board of directors as of the date of the merger agreement and
(b) becomes known to our board of directors prior to the receipt of approval of the merger by holders of our
Common Stock; provided, however, that:
the receipt, existence of or terms of an inquiry or company takeover proposal will not constitute an
intervening event; and
changes in the market price or trading volume of our Common Stock or our Preferred Stock or the fact
that we (including after giving effect to the separation) or Bluerock Homes meet or exceed internal or
published projections, budgets, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial results
for any period, in and of themselves, will not constitute an intervening event; provided, however, that
the underlying causes of such changes will not be excluded by the provision described in this bullet
point.
Nothing contained in the merger agreement will prohibit us or our board of directors from:
taking and disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act;
making any “stop, look and listen” communication to our stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act; or
making any disclosure to our stockholders if our board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with our outside legal counsel, that the failure of our board of directors to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable law; provided that that
neither we nor our board of directors will be permitted to recommend that our stockholders tender

These rights of Parent are limited, however, in that (1) neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may be required

or applicable law, (2) any such conversions, exercises of any rights of termination or other terminations, sales

"Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc._20220311_DEFM14A_19938922_4406918.Pdf",The Separation and the Distribution,"The Separation and the Distribution
We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but not
prior to the satisfaction of the other conditions to closing of the merger), consummate the separation and the
distribution as contemplated by, and subject to the terms of, the separation documentation. We and Parent
have agreed to cooperate reasonably with each other to cause the distribution to be effected on the closing
date, prior to the merger effective time.
We have agreed to cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis and in good faith
regarding our efforts and progress with respect to the separation and the distribution. We have agreed to
prepare and provide drafts of the separation documentation to Parent reasonably in advance of the intended
date for filing the forms of such documents as part of the Bluerock Homes registration statement and have
agreed to make our applicable representatives available to Parent’s representatives for purposes of
discussing such drafts. We and Bluerock Homes have agreed to not file forms or drafts of the separation
documentation with the SEC without the prior written approval of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).
We have agreed to provide a draft of the Bluerock Homes registration statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, to Parent reasonably in advance of the intended date for the filing thereof with the SEC,
and have agreed to cause our representatives to consider in good faith, prior to the filing thereof, the
reasonable comments of Parent and its counsel to the extent relating to descriptions of the merger agreement,
our assets and liabilities (after giving effect to the separation) or the separation documentation. We have
agreed to notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of
any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Bluerock Homes
registration statement and have agreed to cooperate with Parent with respect to any responses to such
comments. We have agreed to promptly notify Parent in writing of the effectiveness of the Bluerock Homes
registration statement and will consult with Parent regarding the timing of the declaration, payment and
record date for the distribution.
Prior to the separation and the distribution, we and our applicable subsidiaries have agreed to enter into the
separation documentation, which will contain terms consistent with the separation principles. The separation
principles, which are included in Exhibit A hereto, provide that the separation and the distribution will
generally be consummated pursuant to terms and conditions customary for public company spin-off
transactions in conjunction with a business combination transaction with a third party involving the public
company or the spun-off company, to the extent not otherwise provided in the merger agreement (including
the separation principles). In connection with the separation, the separation principles provide, among other
things, that all assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries primarily related to the Bluerock
Homes Business, including certain specific assets identified therein, will be allocated to Bluerock Homes,
and that all other assets and liabilities will be retained by us. The separation documentation will include
customary indemnification provisions pursuant to which we (after giving effect to the separation) and
Bluerock Homes will indemnify each other for certain specified losses.
Immediately prior to the effective time of the distribution, we will contribute to Bluerock Homes an amount of
cash equal to $185,700,000, which amount will be (x) reduced dollar-for-dollar by (i) cash used or paid by us
or our subsidiaries after the execution of the merger agreement to acquire assets that will be
98 TABLE OF CONTENTS
allocated to Bluerock Homes in the separation to the extent not funded with Bluerock Homes debt, (ii) cash
used by us or our subsidiaries after the execution of the merger agreement to pay any principal in respect of
Bluerock Homes debt, (iii) cash paid (and an equivalent amount for shares of our Common Stock issued
above a specified threshold) in redemption of common units of our operating partnership after the execution
of the merger agreement, and (iv) cash held by Bluerock Homes and its subsidiaries immediately prior to such
contribution and (y) increased dollar-for-dollar by (i) the Employment Payments (as defined below), to the
extent that such payments are waived by the applicable service provider(s), (ii) cash received by us and our
subsidiaries after the execution of the merger agreement in connection with the disposition or redemption of
assets to be allocated to Bluerock Homes, (iii) cash proceeds received in respect of Bluerock Homes debt
incurred after the execution of the merger agreement, to the extent that the proceeds thereof or cash received
therefrom are not used to acquire assets that will be allocated to Bluerock Homes in the separation, and (iv)
the net levered cash flow attributable to the operation of the Bluerock Homes business after the execution of
the merger agreement. To the extent that the cash amount referenced in the immediately prior sentence is a
negative number, then immediately prior to the effective time of the distribution, Bluerock Homes will
distribute to us an amount of cash equal to the absolute value of such cash amount.
The separation principles provide that Bluerock Homes will assume all assets and liabilities relating to
current and former service providers of our or our subsidiaries and employee benefit plans and agreements,
other than (i) liabilities with respect to the restricted stock awards (as described in “- Treatment of Common
Stock, Preferred Stock, Company Warrants and Equity Awards - Restricted Stock Awards”) and (ii) certain
employment payments (the “Employment Payments”) that certain service providers of ours are entitled to
upon the consummation of the merger (subject to certain conditions), unless such Employment Payments are
waived by the applicable service provider(s). With respect to transaction litigation, the separation principles
provide that following the closing, Bluerock Homes will control the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
transaction litigation, but may not compromise, settle or agree to compromise or settle any such litigation
without our prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Bluerock
Homes will give the surviving company the opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense or
settlement of any such litigation and will give due consideration to the surviving company advice with
respect to such litigation. Liabilities related to any such litigation will be borne by the surviving company, up
to a specified deductible, then will be borne 25% by Bluerock Homes and 75% by the surviving company.
The separation principles provide that the consummation of the distribution will be subject to conditions
customary for public company spin-off transactions, including (i) all necessary permits and authorizations
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act relating to the issuance and trading of shares of common
stock of Bluerock Homes having been obtained and being in effect and such shares of common stock of
Bluerock Homes having been approved for listing on the applicable stock exchange, (ii) our having received
opinion(s) (which continue to be valid) in customary form from one or more nationally recognized valuation
or accounting firms or investment banks reasonably acceptable to Parent, as to the solvency of Bluerock
Homes after giving effect to the distribution, and (iii) certain internal restructuring steps contemplated by the
separation principles, including the Exchange, having been completed in all material respects.
In order to implement the internal restructuring steps contemplated by the separation principles, among other
things, our operating partnership will contribute its interests in our multi-family residential real estate
business and certain other assets to a newly-formed limited partnership (“New LP”). Our operating
partnership will then redeem all of our preferred units in the operating partnership and 25,210,092 of our
common units in the operating partnership as consideration for all of the operating partnership’s interests in
New LP in the Exchange. As a result, our operating partnership will cease to hold interests in our multi-family
residential real estate business, and will only hold the assets related to the Bluerock Homes Business. All of
our executive officers, other than Mr. Konig, along with certain entities related to them, have agreed to retain
their interests in the operating partnership until the earlier of the merger effective time and the termination of
the merger agreement, rather than redeeming their interests for cash or shares of Common Stock. As a result,
immediately following the separation, taking into account the equity interests of our operating partnership
held by the Company which are to be redeemed in the Exchange, the Company is expected to own
approximately 35% of the Bluerock Homes Business and the holders of units in our operating partnership
(other than the Company) will own approximately 65% of the Bluerock Homes Business. The Company’s
approximately 35% interest in the Bluerock Homes Business will then be distributed

to our common stockholders pursuant to the distribution. See “The Merger - Interests of Our Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger.”
In connection with the separation and the distribution, Bluerock Homes and the operating partnership
(which will be controlled by Bluerock Homes following the separation) will enter into a management
agreement with the Manager. The Manager will be an affiliate of Bluerock Real Estate, L.L.C., which is an
affiliate of our former external manager, BRG Manager, LLC. The Manager will be responsible for, among
other things, (i) the selection, purchase and sale of Bluerock Homes’ portfolio investments, (ii) Bluerock
Homes’ financing activities, and (iii) providing Bluerock Homes with advisory services. Certain individuals
who are currently our executive officers are expected to be executive officers of Bluerock Homes and the
Manager following the distribution, and our directors are expected to be members of the board of directors of
Bluerock Homes following the distribution. Bluerock Homes will pay the Manager a base management fee of
1.50% per year of Bluerock Homes’ new stockholders’ equity, per year. Bluerock Homes will also pay the
Manager a quarterly incentive fee of an amount, not less than zero, equal to the difference between (1) the
product of (i) 20% and (ii) the difference between (a) Bluerock Homes’ AFFO for the previous twelve (12)-
month period and (b) the product of (A) the product of (x) the weighted average of the price per share of
equity securities of Bluerock Homes as derived from the NAV and the issue price of equity securities of
Bluerock Homes issued in future offerings and transactions, multiplied by (y) the weighted average number
of all shares of common stock of Bluerock Homes outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (including any
restricted stock units, any restricted shares of common stock of Bluerock Homes, LTIP units, and other
shares of common stock of Bluerock Homes underlying awards granted under incentive plans and units in
the operating partnership) in the previous twelve (12)-month period multiplied by (B) 8%, and (2) the sum of
any incentive fee paid to our Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous
twelve (12)-month period; provided, however, that no incentive fee is payable with respect to any calendar
quarter unless AFFO is greater than zero for the four most recently completed calendar quarters, or the
number of completed calendar quarters since the distribution date, whichever is less. For purposes of
calculating the incentive fee during the first 12 months after completion of the distribution, AFFO will be
determined by annualizing the applicable period following completion of the distribution. One half of each
quarterly installment of each of the base management fee and the incentive fee will be payable in C-LTIPs.
The remainder of each of the base management fee and the incentive fee will be payable in cash or C-LTIPs,
at the election of Bluerock Homes’ board of directors. Bluerock Homes will also reimburse the Manager for
certain expenses. The Management Agreement will have an initial term that will expire on the first
anniversary of the distribution and will be automatically renewed for a one-year term on each anniversary
date thereafter, unless terminated or not renewed pursuant to its terms. A termination fee of 3.0x the base
management and incentive fees earned during the twelve (12) months prior to termination will be payable in
the event the Management Agreement is not renewed or terminated in certain circumstances. Upon an
internalization of the management of Bluerock Homes, the Management Agreement provides for a payment to
the Manager in an amount equal to 2.75x the base management and incentive fees earned during the twelve
(12) months prior to internalization.",106,108

In connection with the merger, the holders (R. Ramin Kamfar, James G. Babb III, Ryan S. MacDonald, Jordan
B. Ruddy, Michael L. Konig (who are members of our management) and certain of their affiliated entities),
solely in their capacity as our stockholders and limited partners of our operating partnership, have entered
into support agreements with Parent pursuant to which the holders agreed, among other things, (i) to vote
their respective covered shares other than any excess shares, in favor of the approval of the merger, (ii) to
vote their respective covered shares, other than any excess shares, against any company takeover proposal
and any other action that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, materially delay,
materially postpone or adversely affect the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement or result in a breach in any material respect of any of the covenants, representations or warranties
or other obligations or agreements of us under the merger agreement, of us or Bluerock Homes under the
separation documentation or of such holder under the applicable support agreement, and (iii) not to transfer
their respective covered shares, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.
As of the record date, the covered shares represented approximately 11.69% of the outstanding voting power
of our Common Stock after giving effect to the voting provisions relating to excess shares. Under the
stockholders agreement, if at any meeting of stockholders the holders of our Class C Common Stock own
shares of Class C Common Stock representing more than 9.9% of the voting rights of our then-outstanding
Common Stock (the “excess shares”), then such holders shall vote such excess shares as directed by our
board of directors. Under the merger agreement, unless our board of directors effects a company adverse
recommendation change, any excess shares (which represented approximately 1.67% of the outstanding
voting power of our Common Stock as of the record date) must be voted in favor of the approval of the
merger.
The support agreements automatically terminate upon the earlier of (i) the merger effective time and (ii) the
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms.

The table below sets forth, as of March 7, 2022, certain information regarding the total beneficial ownership
of shares of our Class A Common Stock, shares of our Class C Common Stock, and shares of our Class A
Common Stock issuable upon redemption of common units and LTIP Units, for (1) each person known to us
to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, (2) each of our
directors and named executive officers, and (3) all of our directors and named executive officers as a group.
Each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the shares of
Common Stock shown as beneficially owned by such person, except as otherwise set forth in the notes to
the table.
The SEC has defined “beneficial ownership” of a security to mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of
voting power and/or investment power over such security. A stockholder is also deemed to be, as of any
date, the beneficial owner of all securities that such stockholder has the right to acquire within 60 days after
that date through (1) the exercise of any option, warrant or right, (2) the conversion of a security, (3) the
power to revoke a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement or (4) the automatic termination of a
trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by
a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our Common Stock subject to options,
vesting or other rights (as set forth above) held by that person that are exercisable or will become exercisable
or vest within 60 days thereafter, are deemed outstanding, while such shares are not deemed outstanding for
purposes of computing percentage ownership of any other person.

outstanding, 76,603 shares of Class C Common Stock outstanding, 5,884,827 OP Units outstanding and
2,947,233 vested LTIP Units outstanding, in each case as of March 7, 2022, for a total of 38,169,292

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as banks and brokers) to satisfy
the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders
sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This
process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially means extra convenience for
stockholders and cost savings for companies.
A number of brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be “householding” our proxy
materials. A single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless
contrary instructions have been received from the impacted stockholders. Once you have received notice
from your broker that it will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will
continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer
wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual
report, please notify us, by calling (212) 843-1601 or by directing your written request to: Bluerock
Residential Growth REIT, Inc., 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 32nd Floor, New York, New York 10105,
Attention: Michael L. Konig, Secretary. Pursuant to such request, the Company will undertake to promptly
deliver a separate copy of the proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, to you. Stockholders who
currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request
“householding” of their communications should contact their brokers as specified above.

Board of Directors 
Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. 
1345 Avenue of the Americas 
32nd Floor 
New York, New York 10105
Members of the Board:
We understand that Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (the “Company”), Badger Parent LLC (the
“Buyer”) and Badger Merger Sub LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (“Merger Sub”), propose to
enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated December 19, 2021
(the “Merger Agreement”), which contemplates, among other things, (i) the separation of the Company
Remainco Business (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) from the Spinco Business (as such
term is defined in the Merger Agreement) (the “Separation”), followed by the distribution to the holders of
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) as of the
record date for such distribution all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Bluerock Homes Trust, Inc. (“Spinco”), (“Spinco Common Stock,” and such distribution, the “Distribution”),
and (ii) the subsequent merger (the “Merger,” and together with the Separation and the Distribution, the
“Transactions”) of the Company with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than shares of Company
Common Stock owned by the Buyer or any wholly owned subsidiaries of the Buyer or the Company, will be
converted into the right to receive $24.25 per share in cash, without interest (such $24.25 per share cash
consideration, together with the shares of Spinco Common Stock to be received by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock in the Distribution, the “Consideration”). Certain terms and conditions of the
Separation, the Distribution and the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such
holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial
information of the Company;
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning
the Company;
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the
Company with senior executives of the Company;
Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock;
Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of
Company Common Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the
Company, and their respective securities;
Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition
transactions;
Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and
the Buyer and certain other parties and their financial and legal advisors;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Reviewed the Merger Agreement, including the Separation Principles, the term sheet for the
Management Agreement to be entered into among Spinco, Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P. and
an external manager to be newly formed in connection with the Separation and the Distribution and
the equity commitment letter, limited guaranty and support agreement, each substantially in the
form of the drafts dated December 19, 2021, and certain related documents; and
Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors
as we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and
formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the financial projections of the Company, we
have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the
Company and we express no opinion on such projections. In addition, we have assumed that the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated in
accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any
terms or conditions that would be material to our analysis. We express no opinion as to the terms of
financing by Buyer or the terms or conditions upon which it is obtained. We do not express any view on, and
this opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection therewith. We have also assumed that the
definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the December 19, 2021 draft thereof
furnished to us. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”) has assumed that in connection with the
receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection
with the proposed Transactions, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would
have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed
Transactions. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied
upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory
advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness
of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or
any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in the transaction. Morgan Stanley also expresses no opinion as to the relative fairness of
any consideration to be received pursuant to the Merger Agreement to holders of any other equity securities
of the Company. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Transactions as compared to any
other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be
achieved or are available. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities of the Company or Spinco, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our
opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this
opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm this opinion.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this
transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which is payable quarterly, a portion of which
is contingent upon rendering of this financial opinion and a portion of which is contingent upon the closing
of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory and financing
services for the Buyer and its affiliates and have received fees in connection with such services. Morgan
Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer, the Company and
their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment
management and individual wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities
underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime
brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan

transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of
the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any currency or
commodity, that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other
professionals in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of
Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without our prior written
consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is
required to make with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Transactions if such
inclusion is required by applicable law or regulation. In addition, this opinion does not in any manner
address the prices at which Spinco Common Stock will trade following consummation of the Transactions or
at any time and Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of the
Company should vote at the shareholders’ meeting to be held in connection with the Merger.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from
a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
Very truly yours,

Confidential
Board of Directors 
Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc.

New York, NY 10105
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (the “Company”) has engaged Duff & Phelps, A Kroll Business
operating as Kroll, LLC (“Duff & Phelps”) to serve as an independent financial advisor to the Board of
Directors (the “Board of Directors”) of the Company (solely in their capacity as members of the Board of
Directors) to provide an opinion (the “Opinion”) as of the date hereof as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the Company, of the Consideration (as defined below) to be paid by the Company in the
Exchange (as defined below).
Description of the Proposed Transaction
It is Duff & Phelps’ understanding that the Company will undertake a series of transactions resulting in the
separation of the Company’s single-family residential real estate business (and certain build-to-rent and non-
single-family residential real estate properties) (together, the “Single Family Business”) from the Company’s
multi-family residential real estate business (the “Multi-Family Business”), followed by the distribution to
the holders of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Common
Stock”), as of the record date for such distribution, all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Bluerock Homes Trust, Inc. (“Spinco”) and the subsequent merger (the “Merger”) of the
Company with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Badger Parent LLC (the “Purchaser”), as follows:
The Company’s existing operating partnership (the “OP”) will form a lower-tier limited partnership or limited
liability company (the “New LP”). The OP will then contribute its interests in the Multi-Family Business to
the New LP. The OP will then distribute its interests in the New LP to the Company as consideration for a
redemption of all of the Company’s preferred interest in the OP and 25,210,092 of the Company’s common
units in the OP (the “Consideration,” and the transactions described in this paragraph, the “Exchange”).
After completing the Exchange, the Company will contribute its remaining interest in the OP (including the
general partnership interest) to Spinco and distribute its ownership interest in Spinco to the Company’s
common stockholders (the “Distribution”). Immediately following the Distribution, the Merger will be
consummated, and each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger, other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Purchaser or any
wholly owned subsidiaries of the Purchaser or the Company, will be converted into the right to receive
$24.25 per share in cash, without interest. The Exchange, the Distribution and the Merger are collectively
referred to herein as the “Proposed Transaction.” This opinion does not address any aspect of the
Distribution or the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In rendering this Opinion, Duff & Phelps is not expressing any opinion with respect to the amount or nature
of any compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such
persons, relative to the consideration to be received by the public shareholders of the Company in the
Proposed Transaction, or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
This Opinion is furnished solely for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors and the Company in
connection with its consideration of the Exchange pursuant to the Proposed Transaction and is not intended
to, and does not, confer any rights or remedies upon any other person, and is not intended to be used, and
may not be used, by any other person or for any other purpose, without Duff & Phelps’ express consent,
except as otherwise set forth in the Engagement Letter (as defined below). This Opinion (i) does not address
the fairness of the consideration to be received by the Company’s shareholders in the Merger; (ii) does not

strategy or transaction; (iii) does not address any transaction related to the Exchange, including the
Distribution and the Merger; (iv) is not a recommendation as to how the Board of Directors or any
stockholder should vote or act with respect to any matters relating to the Proposed Transaction, or whether
to proceed with the Proposed Transaction or any related transaction, and (v) does not indicate that the
Consideration is the best possibly attainable under any circumstances; instead, it merely states whether the
Consideration in the Exchange is within a range suggested by certain financial analyses. The decision as to
whether to proceed with the Exchange and the Proposed Transaction or any related transaction may depend
on an assessment of factors unrelated to the financial analysis on which this Opinion is based. This letter
should not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on the part of Duff & Phelps to any party.
This Opinion is solely that of Duff & Phelps, and Duff & Phelps’ liability in connection with this letter shall
be limited in accordance with the terms set forth in the engagement letter between Duff & Phelps and the
Company dated December 14, 2021 (the “Engagement Letter”). This letter is confidential, and its use and
disclosure is strictly limited in accordance with the terms set forth in the Engagement Letter.
Disclosure of Prior Relationships
Duff & Phelps has acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors and will receive a fee for its services.
No portion of Duff & Phelps’ fee is contingent upon either the conclusion expressed in this Opinion or
whether or not the Proposed Transaction is successfully consummated. Pursuant to the terms of the
Engagement Letter, a portion of Duff & Phelps’ fee is payable upon Duff & Phelps’ stating to the Board of
Directors that it is prepared to deliver its Opinion. Other than this engagement, during the two years
preceding the date of this Opinion, Duff & Phelps has provided certain valuation services to the Company
and it is the intent of the Company to engage Duff & Phelps for certain opinion services related to the
Distribution. Additionally, Duff & Phelps has in the past provided, and continues to provide, the Purchaser
with periodic portfolio valuation services. Furthermore, Duff & Phelps has previously been and is currently
engaged to provide financial advisory services to the Purchaser in connection with related party
transactions and valuation advisory services for certain of the Purchaser’s portfolio companies. For these
prior and future engagements, Duff & Phelps received, and will receive, customary fees, expense
reimbursement, and indemnification. For the avoidance of any doubt, Duff & Phelps is not engaged to
provide any services to the Purchaser in connection with the Proposed Transaction.
Conclusion
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, Duff & Phelps is of the opinion that as of the date hereof the
Consideration to be paid by the Company in the Exchange is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
Company.
This Opinion has been approved by the Opinion Review Committee of Duff & Phelps.

The Board of Directors of 
Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. 
712 Fifth Avenue, 9  Floor 
New York, NY 10019
Gentlemen:
Robert A. Stanger & Co., Inc. (“Stanger”) has been advised that Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (the
“Company”) is contemplating separating its single-family residential real estate business and certain build-to-
rent and non-single-family residential real estate properties (the “Spinco Business”) from its multi-family
residential real estate business (the “Spinco Transaction”). Stanger has been advised that the Company has
formed Spinco, named Business Bluerock Homes Trust, Inc. (“Spinco”), which, after an internal restructuring,
is anticipated to hold the assets and liabilities related to the Spinco Business, including the general partner
interest and an anticipated minority limited partner interest in Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., (the
“Operating Partnership”) holding the Spinco Business. Stanger has been advised that the Company intends
to then distribute 100% of Spinco common shares to its shareholders. Stanger has been further advised that
after this distribution, Spinco and the Operating Partnership intend to enter into a management contract (the
“Management Agreement”) with an external manager. The Company, which would no longer hold Spinco and
the Spinco Business, would then merge into a merger sub wholly owned by a third party purchaser.
The board of directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) has requested that Stanger provide to the
Board of Directors its opinion (the “Opinion”) as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Spinco of
the terms of the Management Agreement.
Stanger, founded in 1978, has provided information, research, financial advisory and consulting services to
clients located throughout the United States, including major New York Stock Exchange member firms,
insurance companies and over seventy companies engaged in the management and operation of
partnerships and real estate investment trusts. The financial advisory activities of Stanger include strategic
planning, mergers and acquisitions, advisory and fairness opinion services, asset and securities valuations,
industry and company analysis, and litigation support and expert witness services in connection with both
publicly registered and privately placed securities transactions.
Stanger, as part of its financial advisory business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, and reorganizations and for estate, tax, corporate
and other purposes. In particular, Stanger’s valuation practice principally involves real estate investment
trusts and partnerships, and the securities issued by and the assets owned through such entities including,
but not limited to, real properties and property interests.
In the course of our review to render this opinion, we have, among other things:
Reviewed a copy of the Management Agreement Term Sheet setting forth the key terms of the
Management Agreement (the “Term Sheet”);
Reviewed a five year projection model for the Spinco Business as prepared by management of the
Company;
Reviewed the financial terms of management agreements for 12 publicly traded REITs;
Reviewed the financial terms of management agreements for 15 non-traded NAV REITs; and
Conducted such other analyses as we deemed appropriate.
In conducting our review and in rendering this fairness opinion, we have assumed with your consent that
the terms of the Management Agreement will not, when executed, differ in any material respect from

Robert A. Stanger & Co., Inc. (“Stanger”) has been advised that Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (the
“Company”) is contemplating separating its single-family residential real estate business and certain build-to-
rent and non-single-family residential real estate properties (the “Spinco Business”) from its multi-family
residential real estate business (the “Spinco Transaction”). Stanger has been advised that the Company has
formed Spinco, named Business Bluerock Homes Trust, Inc. (“Spinco”), which, after an internal restructuring,
is anticipated to hold the assets and liabilities related to the Spinco Business, including the general partner
interest and an anticipated minority limited partner interest in Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., (the
“Operating Partnership”) holding the Spinco Business. Stanger has been advised that the Company intends
to then distribute 100% of Spinco common shares to its shareholders. Stanger has been further advised that
after this distribution, Spinco and the Operating Partnership intend to enter into a management contract (the
“Management Agreement”) with an external manager. The Company, which would no longer hold Spinco and
the Spinco Business, would then merge into a merger sub wholly owned by a third party purchaser.
The board of directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) has requested that Stanger provide to the
Board of Directors its opinion (the “Opinion”) as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Spinco of
the terms of the Management Agreement.
Stanger, founded in 1978, has provided information, research, financial advisory and consulting services to
clients located throughout the United States, including major New York Stock Exchange member firms,
insurance companies and over seventy companies engaged in the management and operation of
partnerships and real estate investment trusts. The financial advisory activities of Stanger include strategic
planning, mergers and acquisitions, advisory and fairness opinion services, asset and securities valuations,
industry and company analysis, and litigation support and expert witness services in connection with both
publicly registered and privately placed securities transactions.
Stanger, as part of its financial advisory business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, and reorganizations and for estate, tax, corporate
and other purposes. In particular, Stanger’s valuation practice principally involves real estate investment
trusts and partnerships, and the securities issued by and the assets owned through such entities including,
but not limited to, real properties and property interests.
In the course of our review to render this opinion, we have, among other things:
Reviewed a copy of the Management Agreement Term Sheet setting forth the key terms of the
Management Agreement (the “Term Sheet”);
Reviewed a five year projection model for the Spinco Business as prepared by management of the
Company;
Reviewed the financial terms of management agreements for 12 publicly traded REITs;
Reviewed the financial terms of management agreements for 15 non-traded NAV REITs; and
Conducted such other analyses as we deemed appropriate.
In conducting our review and in rendering this fairness opinion, we have assumed with your consent that
the terms of the Management Agreement will not, when executed, differ in any material respect from

amounts received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered

portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this Article III that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to the

property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover
Proposal (other than (A) in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring Person to this
Section 6.3 and to limit its conversation or other communication exclusively to such referral and (B) the
Company Board may correspond in writing with any Person making such an unsolicited written
Company Takeover Proposal to request clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to
determine whether such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Company Superior Proposal). The Company shall promptly following the date hereof (x)
request that each Person (other than Parent, its controlled Affiliates and their respective
Representatives) that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with any Company
Takeover Proposal promptly return or destroy all non-public information concerning Company
Remainco or its Subsidiaries furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof and (y) terminate any data room access of, or provision of other
diligence materials to, each such Person (and its Representatives).
(b) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent and Merger Sub) that may be ongoing
with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission
under, any standstill or confidentiality provision with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or
similar matter in any agreement to which the Company is a party; provided that, notwithstanding
anything in this agreement to the contrary, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable Law, the Company may grant a
limited waiver of any standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a
non-public Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board and, to the extent permitted by the other
subsections of this Section 6.3, thereafter negotiate and enter into any transaction in connection
therewith.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if (x) at any time after the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
receives a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal from any Person that did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.3, and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, then, prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company and its Representatives may (i) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person that has made such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and
(ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company
takes any of the actions in clauses (i) and (ii) above.
(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt) notify Parent in
writing in the event that the Company or any of its Affiliates receives a Company Takeover Proposal or
any initial request for nonpublic information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any
Person that informs the Company or its Representatives that it is considering making, or has made, a
Company Takeover Proposal, or any other initial Inquiry from any Person regarding a Company
A-46 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Takeover Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Company Takeover
Proposal or Inquiry and the material terms and conditions thereof. In addition, the Company shall
promptly (but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) after the receipt thereof provide to Parent
copies of any written Company Takeover Proposals or Inquiries, including any written documentation
(including drafts of proposed agreements) relating thereto and shall notify Parent of any change to the
financial and other material terms and material conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours), including by providing a copy of all written proposals,
offers, draft of proposed agreements or correspondence relating thereto; provided that the Company
may redact the documentation and terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal or
Inquiries, to the extent the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that such redactions are required by existing contractual obligations to protect confidential
information of the business or operations of the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal or
Inquiry. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provide to Parent any
nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any other
Person in connection with any Company Takeover Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing the information described in
Sections 6.3(c) and 6.3(d) to Parent.
(e) Except as permitted by this Section 6.3(e) or Section 6.3(f), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) change, withhold, qualify or withdraw, in each case in any manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (or resolve or publicly propose to do so), (B)
approve, adopt or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Company Takeover Proposal (or
resolve or publicly propose to do so) or (C) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a “Company Adverse
Recommendation Change”) or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement with a Person that has
informed the Company or its Representatives that it is considering making, or has made, a Company
Takeover Proposal (or any Representative of such Person) relating to, or any agreement providing for, a
Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
accordance with Section 6.3(c)) (a “Company Acquisition Agreement”) or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s duties under applicable Law; provided that prior
to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (1) the Company has given Parent prior
written notice of its intention to take such action specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor
(including a description in reasonable detail of the Intervening Event), (2) during the four (4) Business
Day period following Parent’s receipt of the notice referred to in the preceding clause (1) (the “Notice of
Intervening Event Period”), the Company shall, and shall cause each of its officers to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each of its other Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(if Parent requests to negotiate) with respect to such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as are proposed in writing by Parent and (3) upon the end of the Notice of Intervening Event
Period, the Company Board shall have considered any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would still
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company directors’ duties under applicable Law if
such revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if (x) the Company has not breached Section 6.3(e) or this
Section 6.3(f) and has not breached the other subsections of this Section 6.3 in any material respect and
(y) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover
A-47 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.3 made after the date hereof constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1(h) in order to substantially concurrently enter into a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of such Company Superior Proposal; provided that prior to so making a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, (1) the Company has given Parent
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, including the material terms and conditions of,
and the identity of the Person making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has
contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal and a copy of any
proposed Company Acquisition Agreements, (2) during the four (4) Business Day period following
Parent’s receipt of the notice referred to in the preceding clause (1) (the “Match Period”), the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its officers to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its
other Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (if Parent requests to negotiate) with
respect to such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as are proposed in writing
by Parent, (3) at the end of such Match Period, the Company Board shall have considered any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Company
Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if such
revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and (4) in the event of any change to any of the
financial terms or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in
each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1)
above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (1) of this proviso shall commence during
which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.3(f) anew
with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (1) through (4) of this proviso; provided,
further, that any such new notice period shall be a period of two (2) Business Days following receipt by
Parent of any such additional notice.
(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i)
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any
“stop, look and listen” communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of
the Company Board to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
applicable Law; provided that that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender any securities in connection with any tender
offer or exchange offer that is a Company Takeover Proposal or otherwise effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect thereto, except as permitted by Section 6.3(e) or Section 6.3(f).
(h) Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, the Company and its Representatives
shall not be restricted in any way with respect to proposals or offers relating to, or engaging in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, furnishing information in connection with, or entering into any
letter of intent, acquisition agreement or other agreement in connection with or with respect to, any
transaction involving only Spinco, its Subsidiaries or the Spinco Business, to the extent any such
transaction (i) would only be consummated following the Effective Time and (ii) would not reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
Merger.
(i) The Company and the Company Board shall not take any action to exempt any person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates) from or render inapplicable (A) the “Aggregate Share Ownership
Limit” or the “Common Stock Ownership Limit”  (including by establishing or increasing an “Excepted
Holder Limit”) in each case as such terms are defined in the Company Organizational Documents or (B)
any Takeover Statute unless, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), such actions are taken substantially
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h).

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
prepare a preliminary Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such preliminary Proxy Statement and the Company shall consider in good faith any
comments on such response reasonably and timely proposed by Parent and, after approval by Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), file with the SEC the preliminary
proxy statement. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and shall furnish all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall respond promptly to any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt
of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by
the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company
and any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to
responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to consult and review such response and
the Company shall consider in good faith any comments on such response reasonably and timely
proposed by Parent. The Proxy Statement and the Spinco Registration Statement shall each comply as
to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act (or
the Securities Act, in the case of a Spinco Registration Statement filed on Form S-1 or Form S-11 under
the Securities Act). If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof), in the case of the Proxy Statement, or the effectiveness of the Spinco
Registration Statement or the consummation of the Distribution, in the case of the Spinco Registration
Statement, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Spinco Registration Statement, so that the Proxy Statement,
Spinco Registration Statement or other filings would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed by the Company (or Spinco, as applicable) with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that no
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be filed with the SEC or mailed by the Company
without affording Parent a reasonable opportunity in advance for consultation and review, and the
Company shall consider in good faith any comments on such materials reasonably and timely proposed
by Parent. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the earlier of (x) the resolution of any comments of the SEC or
the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement or (y) the receipt of notification that
the SEC is not reviewing the preliminary Proxy Statement (such date, the “Clearance Date”).
(b) Subject to Section 6.4(c), the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Law and the Company Organizational Documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of
the Company stockholders’ voting upon the approval of the Merger (the “Company Stockholders’
Meeting”) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Clearance Date. Unless the Company shall
have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change to the extent permitted by Section 6.3, the
Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall solicit, and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders’
Meeting (including by soliciting proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement).
(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding
its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders’ Meeting after

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
prepare a preliminary Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such preliminary Proxy Statement and the Company shall consider in good faith any
comments on such response reasonably and timely proposed by Parent and, after approval by Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), file with the SEC the preliminary
proxy statement. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and shall furnish all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall respond promptly to any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt
of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by
the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company
and any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to
responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to consult and review such response and
the Company shall consider in good faith any comments on such response reasonably and timely
proposed by Parent. The Proxy Statement and the Spinco Registration Statement shall each comply as
to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act (or
the Securities Act, in the case of a Spinco Registration Statement filed on Form S-1 or Form S-11 under
the Securities Act). If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof), in the case of the Proxy Statement, or the effectiveness of the Spinco
Registration Statement or the consummation of the Distribution, in the case of the Spinco Registration
Statement, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Spinco Registration Statement, so that the Proxy Statement,
Spinco Registration Statement or other filings would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed by the Company (or Spinco, as applicable) with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that no
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be filed with the SEC or mailed by the Company
without affording Parent a reasonable opportunity in advance for consultation and review, and the
Company shall consider in good faith any comments on such materials reasonably and timely proposed
by Parent. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the earlier of (x) the resolution of any comments of the SEC or
the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement or (y) the receipt of notification that
the SEC is not reviewing the preliminary Proxy Statement (such date, the “Clearance Date”).
(b) Subject to Section 6.4(c), the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Law and the Company Organizational Documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of
the Company stockholders’ voting upon the approval of the Merger (the “Company Stockholders’
Meeting”) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Clearance Date. Unless the Company shall
have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change to the extent permitted by Section 6.3, the
Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall solicit, and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders’
Meeting (including by soliciting proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement).
(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding
its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders’ Meeting after

consultation with Parent (i) to the extent reasonably necessary to allow time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and
disseminated under applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time that the Company Stockholders’ Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, (iii) if the Company reasonably determines in good
faith that additional time is required to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of the Merger (provided
that in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), without the prior written consent of Parent, in no event shall the
Company Stockholders’ Meeting be held on a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for
which the Company Stockholders’ Meeting was originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement)) or (iv) with the prior written consent of Parent. Without the prior written consent of Parent
(x) the approval of the Merger shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters
required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the
approval of the Merger) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and (y) the Company shall not submit to the vote of
its stockholders any Company Takeover Proposal. Unless the Company shall have made a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change to the extent permitted by Section 6.3, the Company shall ensure that
the Company Board directs any “Excess Shares”  (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) be voted in
favor of approval of the Merger at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting. Unless this Agreement shall
have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligation of the Company to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any
amendment or supplement thereto that may be required by Law) to the Company’s stockholders shall
not be affected by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
(d) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis and in
good faith regarding its efforts and progress with respect to the Separation and Distribution. The
Company shall prepare and provide drafts of the Separation Documentation to Parent reasonably in
advance of the intended date for filing the forms thereof with the SEC as part of the Spinco Registration
Statement, and, subject to Section 6.2, shall make its applicable Representatives available to Parent’s
Representatives for purposes of discussing such drafts. The Company shall not (and shall cause Spinco
not to) file forms or drafts of the Separation Documentation with the SEC without the prior written
approval of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). As promptly as
reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall cause Spinco to
prepare the Spinco Registration Statement, provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Spinco Registration Statement and consider in good faith, prior to the filing thereof, the
reasonable comments of Parent and its counsel to the extent relating to descriptions of this Agreement,
the assets and liabilities of Company Remainco or the Separation Documentation in the Spinco
Registration Statement. The Company shall provide a draft of the Spinco Registration Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, to Parent reasonably in advance of the intended date for the filing
thereof with the SEC, and shall cause its Representatives to consider in good faith, prior to the filing
thereof, the reasonable comments of Parent and its counsel to the extent relating to descriptions of this
Agreement, the assets and liabilities of Company Remainco or the Separation Documentation. The
Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the
SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Spinco Registration Statement and shall promptly supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or
the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Spinco Registration Statement. Prior to
responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Spinco Registration
Statement, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to consult and review such
response and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments on such response reasonably
and timely proposed by Parent to the extent relating to descriptions of this Agreement, the assets and
liabilities of Company Remainco or the Separation Documentation. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of the effectiveness of the Spinco Registration Statement under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and shall consult with Parent regarding the timing of the declaration,
payment and record date for the Distribution. Prior to the Separation and Distribution, the Company and
its applicable Subsidiaries shall enter into the Separation Documentation.

designee such maximum amount stated in the accountant’s letter; (ii) a letter from counsel of any direct
or indirect equity owner of Parent that is a REIT indicating that such REIT received a private letter ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) holding that the receipt by Parent or its designee of the
Company Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow

Company, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Parent Termination Fee with
an escrow agent selected by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company pursuant to a written
escrow agreement (the “Parent Termination Fee Escrow Agreement”) reflecting the terms set forth in this
Section 8.3(b) and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the escrow agent. The Parent Termination Fee
Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Parent Termination Fee in escrow or the applicable portion
thereof shall be released to the Company on an annual basis based upon the delivery by the Company
to the escrow agent of any one (or a combination) of the following: (i) a letter from the Company’s
independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow
agent to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)
(2) and (3) of the Code for the applicable taxable year of the Company determined as if the payment of
such amount did not constitute Qualifying REIT Income, in which case the escrow agent shall release to
the Company such maximum amount stated in the accountant’s letter; (ii) a letter from the Company’s
counsel indicating that the Company received a private letter ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt
by the Company of the Parent Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or would
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which
case the escrow agent shall release to the Company the remainder of the Parent Termination Fee; (iii) a
letter from the Company’s counsel indicating that the Company has received a tax opinion from its
outside counsel or accountant, respectively, to the effect that the receipt by the Company of the Parent
Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or should be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall
release to the Company the remainder of the Parent Termination Fee; or (iv) a letter from the Company
designating a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of the Company as the recipient of the Parent Termination Fee, in
which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Parent Termination Fee to the Company
or its designee. The Parent Termination Fee Escrow Agreement shall further provide that, at the end of
the fifth calendar year beginning after the date on which Parent’s obligation to pay the Parent
Termination Fee arose (or earlier if directed by the Company), any remaining amount then being held in
escrow by the escrow agent shall be disbursed to Parent. The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to
amend this Section 8.3(b) at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (A) maximize the portion
of the applicable Parent Termination Fee that may be distributed to the Company hereunder without
causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (B)
improve the Company’s chances of securing the favorable private letter ruling from the IRS described in
this Section 8.3(b) or (C) assist the Company in obtaining the favorable tax opinion from its outside
counsel or accountant described in this Section 8.3(b). The Parent Termination Fee Escrow Agreement
shall provide that the Company shall bear all costs and expenses under the Parent Termination Fee
Escrow Agreement.
(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent
Termination Fee is intended to be a penalty but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement

and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, while Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance that requires the Closing
to occur in accordance with Section 9.5 and the payment of the Company Termination Fee, under no
circumstances shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that
requires the Closing to occur and payment of the Company Termination Fee.
(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in
a timely manner the Company Termination Fee, or if Parent fails to pay in a timely manner the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, then the Company shall pay to Parent, or Parent shall pay to the
Company, as applicable, interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such amount
was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2% per annum (the
“Enforcement Expenses”).
(e) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.
(i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, subject to Section 9.5, the Company’s
right to receive the Parent Termination Fee in full in the circumstances in which it is payable, the
Enforcement Expenses and the Reimbursement Obligations shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company against the Parent Related Parties in connection with this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the
termination of this Agreement, any breach of this Agreement or any such other agreement, or the
failure to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
and the Parent Related Parties shall not have any further Liability in connection with the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(e)(i) (x) will not relieve Blackstone Real Estate
Services L.L.C. from Liability to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, (y) will not
limit the Company’s right to specific performance pursuant to the proviso to the last sentence of
Section 9.5(a) and (z) subject to the Liability Limitation (which shall not limit Section 4 of the
Limited Guarantee) and the other limitations described in the Limited Guarantee, will not limit the
Equity Investor’s obligations under and to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee.
(ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, (A) Parent’s right to receive the
Company Termination Fee in full in the circumstances in which it is payable and the Enforcement
Expenses shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub or the Equity Investor
against the Company Related Parties in connection with this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the termination of this
Agreement, any breach of this Agreement or any such other agreement, or the failure to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and the
Company Related Parties shall not have any further Liability in connection with the foregoing and
(B) in no event will (1) any Company Related Party (other than the Company) have any liability for
monetary damages arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or (2) without limiting clause (A),
except in the case of fraud or willful and material breach, any Parent Related Party (including
Parent, Merger Sub or the Equity Investor) obtain any monetary recovery or award in excess of
$60,000,000 plus the Enforcement Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(e)(ii)
(x) will not limit Parent’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.5 and (y) will not
relieve the Company from Liability to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement.

Annex A
Separation Principles
To the extent not otherwise addressed in the Agreement (including these Separation Principles), the
Separation and the Distribution will be consummated pursuant to terms and conditions customary for public
company spin-off transactions in conjunction with a business combination transaction with a third party
involving the public company or the spun-off company. Capitalized terms used but not defined in these
Separation Principles shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.
For purposes of these Separation Principles:
“Company Group” means, individually or collectively, as the case may be, (a) the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such Subsidiary that is treated as a
“disregarded entity” for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or for purposes of any state, local or
foreign tax law) immediately after the Effective Time (and giving effect to the Distribution), (b) any
Person that shall have merged or liquidated into the Company or any such Subsidiary and (c) any
predecessor or successor to any Person otherwise described in this definition.
“Liabilities” shall mean all debts, guarantees, assurances, commitments, liabilities, responsibilities,
losses, remediation, deficiencies, fines, settlements, sanctions, costs, interest and obligations of any
nature or kind, whether accrued or fixed, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, asserted or
unasserted, liquidated or unliquidated, foreseen or unforeseen, known or unknown, reserved or
unreserved, or determined or determinable, including those arising under any law, action (including
any third-party claim) or order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, stipulation, determination or award
entered by or with any governmental authority or arbitration tribunal, and those arising under any
contract, agreement, obligation, indenture, instrument, lease, promise, arrangement, release, warranty,
commitment or undertaking, or any fines, damages or equitable relief that is imposed, in each case,
including all costs and expenses relating thereto.
“Parties” means Spinco and Company Remainco (including, following the Merger, the Surviving
Company) and “Party” means one of them.
“Spinco Group” means individually or collectively, as the case may be, (a) Spinco, the Operating
Partnership and any of their respective Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such
Subsidiary that is treated as a “disregarded entity” for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or for
purposes of any state, local or foreign tax law)) immediately after the Effective Time (and giving effect
to the Distribution), (b) any Person that shall have merged or liquidated into Spinco, the Operating
Partnership or any such Subsidiary and (c) any predecessor or successor to any Person otherwise
described in this definition.
“Transactions” means the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the
Separation and the Distribution.
“Waived Employment Payments” means the aggregate amount of the Employment Payments waived in
whole or in part by the Applicable Individuals, if any.
The Separation:
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries will undertake the internal
restructuring steps as set forth in the step plan attached as Annex A (as modified in accordance
with the terms hereof, the “Step Plan”) (the “Internal Restructuring”). The Company may make
modifications to these Separation Principles and the Step Plan from time to time; provided that any
such modification shall not be adverse (other than in a de minimis respect) to Company Remainco
or, after giving effect to the Merger, Parent, unless Parent has provided its prior written consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Assets and Liabilities Generally: Except as otherwise described herein, without duplication, (i) all
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries primarily related to the Spinco Business, (ii) the
assets included on Schedule A, (iii) the assets included or reflected as assets of Spinco or any of
its Subsidiaries on Unaudited Spinco Financial Statement, subject to any dispositions of such
A-75

TABLE OF CONTENTS
assets subsequent to the date of the Unaudited Spinco Financial Statement and (iv) acquisitions
of assets since the date of the Unaudited Spinco Financial Statement that are of a nature or type
that would have been included on a pro forma combined balance sheet of the Spinco Business or
any notes or subledgers thereto as of the effective time of the Distribution, including any
inventory (were such balance sheet, notes and subledgers prepared on a basis consistent with
the Unaudited Spinco Financial Statement) (such balance sheet and notes and subledgers
thereto, the “Pro Forma Spinco Balance Sheet”), in each case will be allocated to Spinco (or one
or more of its Subsidiaries). Without duplication, all Liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (whether or not such Liabilities arose or are asserted before, at or after the
Distribution) (i) to the extent related to the Spinco assets or the Spinco Business (including all
Liabilities to the extent related to Bluerock REIT Operator, LLC), (ii) included or reflected as
liabilities of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries on the Unaudited Spinco Financial Statement,
subject to any discharge of such Liabilities subsequent to the date of the Unaudited Spinco
Financial Statement, or (iii) in existence as of the effective time of the Distribution that are of a
nature or type that would have resulted in such Liabilities being included or reflected as
Liabilities of the Spinco Business on the Pro Forma Spinco Balance Sheet, in each case, will be
allocated to Spinco (or one or more of its Subsidiaries). In addition to any other exceptions
described in these Separation Principles, exceptions to the foregoing sentences (1) that would
not be adverse (other than in a de minimis respect) to Company Remainco or, after giving effect
to the Merger, Parent or (2) with Parent’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) shall also be permitted. All assets and Liabilities not allocated to Spinco
(or one or more of its Subsidiaries) will be retained by Company Remainco (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries). For the avoidance of doubt, cash and debt shall be addressed by Sections 2 and 3
of these Separation Principles rather than the foregoing provisions of this bullet, and Company
Transaction Litigation shall be addressed by Section 11 of these Separation Principles. The
separation and distribution agreement relating to the Separation and the Distribution will include
customary indemnification provisions pursuant to which Spinco and Company Remainco will
indemnify the other for any losses relating to:
the Liabilities allocated to the indemnifying Party (and its Subsidiaries) and the failure of the
indemnifying Party (or its Subsidiaries) to satisfy any such Liabilities in accordance with
their terms;
any breach by the indemnifying Party (or its Subsidiaries) of the separation and distribution
agreement or other agreements entered into by the Parties (and/or Subsidiaries thereof) in
connection with the Separation or the Distribution;
performance or other guarantees or similar undertakings for the benefit of the indemnifying
Party (or its Subsidiaries) by the other Party (or its Subsidiaries); and
if the indemnifying Party is Spinco, any untrue statement or omission (or alleged untrue
statement or omission) of material fact in the Spinco Registration Statement, information
statement, prospectus, offering memorandum, offering circular or similar disclosure
document that describes the Separation and the Distribution; subject to Section 11 of these
Separation Principles, Company Remainco will indemnify Spinco for claims relating to any
untrue statement or omission (or alleged untrue statement or omission) of material fact in
the Company’s pre-Distribution disclosure documents.
No Party will make any representations or warranties to the other as to the assets or Liabilities to
be transferred.
To the extent that an asset or Liability (or a portion thereof) is not transferred from one Party to
the other prior to the Distribution (because of a failure to receive a consent or otherwise), the
transferring Party will retain that asset or Liability for the transferee Party (with the transferee
bearing all of the benefits and burdens of the asset or Liability), and the asset or Liability will be
transferred as soon as it can be transferred.
Subject to customary exceptions, including for Liabilities arising under any agreement between
the Parties (and/or Subsidiaries thereof) that is in effect following the Distribution, each of

and Company Remainco will release the other and the other’s non-recourse parties (current or
former stockholders, directors, officers, employees, etc.) from all Liabilities of the releasing Party
or with respect to the releasing Party’s assets or business arising before the Distribution.
Prior to the Effective Time, the warrant agreements relating to the Company Warrants will be
amended so that each holder of a Company Warrant that is exercisable but not exercised as of the
Effective Time will be entitled to receive in respect of such Company Warrant only an amount of
cash equal to the difference between the Merger Consideration and the exercise price for each
share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time.
Except with respect to Company Transaction Litigation, which shall be governed by Section 11 of
these Separation Principles, Company Remainco will be responsible for all of the out-of-pocket
fees, costs and expenses of investment bankers, legal counsel, accountants, experts and other
third-party professional advisors, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing costs, proxy solicitation
costs and all transfer taxes, in each case incurred by or on behalf of either Party at or prior to the
Effective Time in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
From and after the Closing, Spinco shall be entitled to the benefit of the Reimbursement
Obligations except that they shall be obligations of Company Remainco, mutatis mutandis.
Indebtedness:
Company Remainco and its Subsidiaries will not be obligated on and, to the extent necessary,
will be released from, Spinco’s debt which shall include debt for borrowed money, bonds or
similar instruments, letters of credit, capitalized leases, derivatives and related guarantees
(including a new credit facility that is contemplated to fund certain acquisitions before the
closing of the Merger) (“Spinco Debt”).
Spinco and its Subsidiaries will not provide credit support for debt remaining with Company
Remainco and its Subsidiaries in accordance with these Separation Principles.
Cash:
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Distribution, the Company will contribute to Spinco
an amount of cash equal to the “Spinco Cash Amount”, which shall be equal to $185,700,000,
reduced dollar-for-dollar by:
any cash used or paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the execution
of the Agreement to acquire assets that will be allocated to Spinco in the Separation
(“Spinco Assets”), but excluding amounts used to acquire Spinco Assets to the
extent funded with the proceeds of Spinco Debt,
the amount of cash used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the
execution of this Agreement to pay any principal in respect of Spinco Debt,
any cash paid in redemption of Common Units of the Operating Partnership after the
execution of the Agreement,
the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Class A Common
Stock issued after the execution of the Agreement in respect of the redemption of a
number of Common Units of the Operating Partnership in excess of 940,567 Common

the amount of cash held by Spinco and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such
contribution by the Company (other than cash received by Spinco or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the Reimbursement Obligations); and
increased dollar-for-dollar by:
the Waived Employment Payments,
any cash received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the execution of
the Agreement in connection with the disposition or redemption of assets that will
be allocated to Spinco in the Separation (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
mezzanine or preferred investments that will be allocated to Spinco),
any cash proceeds received in respect of Spinco Debt incurred after the execution of
the Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, cash proceeds received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the execution of the Agreement derived from
levering a Spinco Asset), to the extent the proceeds thereof or cash received
therefrom are not used to acquire Spinco Assets, and
the net levered cash flow (taking into account capital expenditures and interest
expense, but excluding amounts already taken into account in clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii) or
(b)(ii)) attributable to the operation of the Spinco Business after the execution of the
Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Spinco Cash Amount, as adjusted as set
forth above, is a negative number, then immediately prior to the effective time of the Distribution,
Spinco shall distribute to the Company an amount of cash equal to the absolute value of the
Spinco Cash Amount, as adjusted. Cash shall be deemed to include restricted cash and cash
equivalents.
Shared Contracts: The interests of the Company under that certain Sublease, dated as of February
15, 2019, between AllianceBernstein L.P., as Sublandlord, and Bluerock Real Estate L.L.C. (“BRE”)
and the Company, collectively, as Subtenant, for a portion of the 32nd Floor, 1345 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York (the “Sublease”) will be assigned (subject to any required consents
of Sublandlord and Landlord) to Spinco, including all of the Company’s Liabilities associated
therewith, and the Company (until the consummation of the Distribution) and Spinco (after the
consummation of the Distribution) will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the release, as
of the Distribution, by Sublandlord of Company Remainco from any obligations under the Sublease
as of and after the consummation of the Distribution; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall pay to Spinco at the Closing $2.5 million of the remaining Fixed Rent (as
defined in the Sublease) as of the consummation of the Distribution, and each of BRE and Spinco
shall indemnify Company Remainco from obligations accruing under the Sublease from and after
the consummation of the Distribution. Shared supply, vendor and other agreements will be
transferred to Spinco (or one or more of its Subsidiaries). However, Spinco and its Subsidiaries will
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary third party consents so that the
Company Remainco Business can obtain the benefits currently enjoyed and assume the burdens
undertaken (e.g., through a new agreement, amendment or partial assignment) by the Company
Remainco Business under those agreements.
Intercompany Accounts and Other Agreements:
Agreements between (a) Company Remainco or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (b)
Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, will be terminated as of the completion of
the Distribution without Liability to either Party, other than the separation and distribution
agreement and such other agreements as are customary for public company spin-off transactions
that are entered into by the Parties (and/or Subsidiaries thereof) in connection with the
Separation or the Distribution.

Tax Matters:

tax purposes, (a) the transfer of the entity or entities holding the Company Remainco Business to

“Operating Partnership”) shall be treated as a distribution in partial liquidation of the Company’s
interest in the Operating Partnership, (b) the contribution by the Company of its Operating
Partnership interests to Spinco shall be treated as a transaction described in Section 351 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), (c) the Distribution, in conjunction
with the Merger, shall be treated as a distribution made pursuant to the liquidation of the
Company and described in Section 331(a) of the Code, (d) the Merger shall be treated as (i) a
taxable sale by the Company of all of its assets (as of immediately after the Distribution) to
Merger Sub (or, if Merger Sub is a “disregarded entity,” its regarded owner for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) in exchange for the merger consideration, the preferred redemption amount
and the assumption of the Company’s Liabilities (and any other applicable amounts), followed
by (ii) a complete liquidation of the Company, and (e) the Distribution, together with the receipt
by the shareholders of the Company of the merger consideration and the preferred redemption
amount (and any other applicable amounts) pursuant to the Merger or the preferred stock
redemption, shall be treated as a distribution made in complete liquidation of the Company
described in Section 331(a) of the Code and as in full payment in exchange for the Company’s
stock (the “Intended Tax Treatment”). The Parties will prepare all tax returns in a manner
consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and no Party shall take any contrary or inconsistent
position, whether in a tax return or otherwise, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to
a final determination by a taxing authority.
Spinco REIT Election. Spinco shall make an election to be treated as a real estate investment
trust under Sections 856-860 of the Code and a protective election with the Company to be
treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code, in each case effective as of
the date of the Distribution.

The Company shall be responsible for, without duplication, (a) any taxes imposed with
respect to any Combined Tax Return, (b) any taxes imposed on any member of the Company

described in clause (b) in the immediately succeeding bullet (“Company Taxes”).

any representation, warranty or covenant made by Spinco in the separation-related
agreements, in the case of clause (a), other than any Company Taxes (“Spinco Taxes”).
Preparation of Tax Returns; Tax Proceedings.
Consolidated, combined, affiliated or similar tax returns that include one or more members of
the Company Group together with one or more members of the Spinco Group (a “Combined
Tax Return”) will be prepared and filed (or cause to be prepared and filed) by the entity that
is the common parent of such group (or otherwise the Party required to file such Combined
Tax Return under applicable Law) for the relevant period.
Any separate tax return required to be filed by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (and
any successor to the Company) (a “Company Tax Return”) will be prepared and filed (or
cause to be prepared and filed) by the Company.
Any separate tax return required to be filed by Spinco, the Operating Partnership or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (a “Spinco Tax Return”) will be prepared and filed (or cause to
be prepared and filed) by Spinco.
To the extent any tax return required to be prepared and filed by a member of one group
could reasonably be expected to reflect taxes for which a member of the other group is
responsible, the parent of such other group will be afforded customary review and comment
rights to the extent relating to such taxes, and the Company shall have approval rights (any
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) over any
Combined Tax Return that it is not responsible for preparing.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, (a) all tax returns shall be prepared in accordance
with the Intended Tax Treatment and (b) any tax returns of the Operating Partnership to the
extent relating to the Internal Restructuring shall be prepared as determined by Spinco,
subject to customary review and comment rights (and subject to customary dispute
resolution procedures) to the extent such return could reasonably be expected to reflect
Company Taxes, and no Party shall take any position inconsistent therewith, except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a final determination by a taxing authority.
Control rights and customary non-controlling party protections with respect to tax audits,
reimbursement of taxes or other proceedings to be generally consistent with the foregoing.
Allocation of Employee Liabilities: Spinco will assume all assets and Liabilities (whether or not such
Liabilities arose or are asserted before, at or after the Distribution) relating to current and former
service providers of the Company and its Subsidiaries and employee benefit plans and agreements,
other than (a) as provided in Section 3.3 of the Agreement (cash out of Company Restricted Stock
Awards) and (b) the employment payments set forth on Schedule B (the “Employment Payments”)
to be paid to Ramin Kamfar, Jordan Ruddy, James Babb, Ryan MacDonald, Christopher Vohs,
Michael Konig (through his wholly-owned entity, Konig & Associates, LLC) and Michael DiFranco
(collectively, the “Applicable Individuals”) upon consummation of the Merger, which shall be
assumed by Company Remainco so long as the applicable individual is employed by the Company
or a Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Closing and executes customary release
documentation in favor of Company Remainco and Parent relating to (i) such individual’s
employment or termination of employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries through the date
of release and (ii) such individual’s (or its Affiliates’) capacity as a stockholder of the Company or
partner in the Operating Partnership (which release shall exclude such individual’s right to receive
the consideration he or she is entitled to under the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to,
the consideration he or she is entitled to with respect to any Company Restricted Stock Award),
and Spinco will indemnify Company Remainco and Parent for any such claims made by such
individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clause (b) of this Section 7, any Waived
Employment Payments shall be assumed by Spinco.
Bluerock Name and Bluerock Marks: Following the consummation of the Distribution, Company
Remainco and its controlled Affiliates shall be permitted to use the “Bluerock” name and the

winding down such use; provided that Company Remainco and its controlled Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize and eliminate the use of the “Bluerock” name and the
Bluerock Marks (including the BRE Trademark) as soon as reasonably practicable; provided,
further, that from and after such 180 day period, Company Remainco and its controlled Affiliates
may no longer use the “Bluerock” name or the Bluerock Marks (including the BRE Trademark or
any trademark confusingly similar thereto and Company Remainco and its controlled Affiliates shall
not purport to authorize any other persons to use such trademark, whether as a trademark, service
mark, corporate, trade or d/b/a name, logo or otherwise). From and following the consummation of
the Distribution, BRE, Spinco and their respective Affiliates shall cease all use of the BRE
Trademark or any trademark confusingly similar thereto and shall not purport to authorize any other
persons to use such trademark, whether as a trademark, service mark, corporate, trade or d/b/a
name, logo or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at all times after the consummation of the
Distribution, Company Remainco and its controlled Affiliates shall be permitted to use the Bluerock
Marks, and BRE, Spinco and their respective Affiliates shall be permitted to use the BRE
Trademark, in each case (x) in legal and business materials that exist as of the date of the
Distribution and are not visible to the general public, (y) in a neutral, non-trademark manner to
describe the history of Company Remainco, BRE, Spinco and the relationship of the Parties and (z)
as required by applicable Law; provided that such use does not give rise to a likelihood of
confusion as to the source or origin of any goods or services or imply any endorsement by, or
ongoing association with, BRE, (in the case of Company Remainco) Spinco, (in the case of Spinco)
Company Remainco, or their respective controlled Affiliates.
Insurance: The Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ occurrence-based policies will be allocated to
Spinco (and its Subsidiaries). Company Remainco (and its Subsidiaries) will be entitled (at its cost)
to make occurrence-based claims in respect of losses incurred prior to the Distribution under the
Company and its Subsidiaries’ occurrence-based policies in effect as of the Distribution to the
extent such policies provided coverage for Company Remainco (or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to
the Distribution. The Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ property-level insurance policies will be
allocated to Spinco to the extent they provided coverage for the Spinco assets. Company Remainco
shall provide customary indemnity and cost reimbursement to Spinco to the extent resulting from
access by Company Remainco to such insurance policies post-Distribution (including bearing all
deductibles, retentions, coinsurance, fees, retroactive and/or future premium increase) and may not
make any claim to the extent it would adversely affect Spinco’s relationship with any such insurer.
Each Party will control its relationship with its own insurers post-Distribution.
Conditions to the Distribution: The consummation of the Distribution shall be subject to conditions
customary for public company spin-off transactions, including the following conditions:
All necessary permits and authorizations under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act relating
to the issuance and trading of shares of Spinco Common Stock shall have been obtained and be
in effect and such shares of Spinco Common Stock shall have been approved for listing on the
applicable stock exchange.
The Company shall have received opinion(s) (which continue to be valid) in customary form from
one or more nationally recognized valuation or accounting firms or investment banks reasonably
acceptable to Parent, as to the solvency of Spinco after giving effect to the Distribution.
The Internal Restructuring shall have been completed in all material respects.
Company Transaction Litigation:
Following the Closing, Spinco shall control the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
Company Transaction Litigation; provided that Spinco shall not compromise, settle or agree to
compromise or settle any Company Transaction Litigation without Company Remainco’s prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Following the
Closing, Spinco shall, subject to the preservation of privilege and confidential information,
give Company Remainco the opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense or

settlement of any Company Transaction Litigation and shall give due consideration to
Company Remainco’s advice with respect to such Company Transaction Litigation.
The first amount of Liabilities incurred by either Party or its Affiliates (whether arising before
or after the Closing) relating to any Company Transaction Litigation (including the defense,
settlement or prosecution thereof), including any indemnification obligations of Company
Remainco (including pursuant to Section 6.8 of the Agreement) up to the Deductible Amount
(as defined on Schedule C), will be borne by Company Remainco, with Liabilities above the
Deductible Amount to be borne 25% by Spinco and 75% by Company Remainco.
To the extent any Company Transaction Litigation results in the repayment of Spinco Debt,
such repayment shall be borne by Spinco.
Other Matters: The separation and distribution agreement shall contain other terms and conditions
customary for public company spin-off transactions in conjunction with a business combination
transaction with a third party involving the public company or the spun-off company, including as

and records, and replacement and release of guarantees and other credit support.
