As of the Record Date, there were 17,357,549 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. The quorum requirement for holding the Special Meeting and transacting business is that holders of a
majority of shares of our common stock entitled to vote must be present in person (including by means of remote
communication) or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present for the
purpose of determining whether a quorum is present, however “broker non-votes” (described in more detail below in
“-Voting of Proxies” beginning on page 3), if any, will not be counted as present for the purpose of determining
whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank,
trustee or other nominee and you do not tell your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to vote your shares,
these shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of

The General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) requires that a majority of the shares of common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date vote in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement in order for the Merger to be consummated. The failure of any common stockholder to vote,
abstentions, and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote by that stockholder “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal. Approval of each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person (including by means of remote communication) or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date.
Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” each of the Adjournment Proposal and the
Compensation Proposal but the failure to vote your shares and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the
outcome of either the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal.

Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the Special Meeting may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy
card by mail in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone, or may vote via the Virtual Special Meeting Website at the Special Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner
and hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you should instruct your
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee. Under NYSE rules, brokers, banks, trustees and other nominees have the
discretion to vote on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting are non-routine matters,
and brokers, banks, trustees and other nominees cannot vote on any of these proposals without your instructions.
As a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, brokers are not empowered to vote
those shares, referred to generally as “broker non-votes.” Broker non-votes, if any, will not be treated as shares that
are present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists and will have the same effect
as votes “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the either Adjournment
Proposal or the Compensation Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present. Because none of the proposals to be
voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, we
do not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Therefore, it is important that you cast your vote or
instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
3TABLE OF CONTENTS
All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the
Special Meeting in the manner specified by the proxy holders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting
instructions will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal and “FOR” the
Compensation Proposal.
Shares represented at the Special Meeting but not voted, including shares for which proxies have been received but
for which common stockholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the Special Meeting for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business.
Only shares affirmatively voted for the Merger Proposal, including properly executed proxies that do not contain
specific voting instructions, will be counted “FOR” that proposal.
If you abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” each of the Adjournment Proposal and
the Compensation Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.
If you do not execute a proxy card and do not vote in person (including by means of remote communication) at the
Special Meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on
either the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the required vote of our common stockholders, or if the Merger is not
completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares. Instead, we will
remain an independent public company, each of our common stock, 8.50% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative
Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), and 8.50% Series
B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series B
Preferred Stock” and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the “Preferred Stock”), will continue to be listed and
traded on the NYSE and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and
we will continue to file periodic and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). If the
Merger is not completed, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of
our common stock may decline significantly, and if that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our
common stock would return to the price at which it traded as of the date of this proxy statement. Under specified
circumstances, we will be required to pay Parent the Termination Fee and the Merger Agreement Expenses (each as
defined in “-Termination Fees and Treatment of Expenses” beginning on page 14) or Parent will be required to pay us
the Parent Termination Fee (as defined in “-Termination Fees and Treatment of Expenses” beginning on page 14) and
the Merger Agreement Expenses, in each case, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement.
If the Merger does not close, we would cause our subsidiaries to engage in a series of transactions such that our
position would be as if the Migration (as defined in “-The Migration” beginning on page 7) had not occurred in all
material respects.

you will no longer have any other rights as a stockholder of the Company (except that stockholders who have
properly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of
their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by the DGCL, as described in “The

(each, an “Equity Incentive Plan” and collectively, the “Equity Incentive Plans”), that remains outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an “Option”) that has a per share exercise price that is less
than $56.00, will be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to such Option
multiplied by (y) the excess of the Common Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise
price of the Option (the “Option Merger Consideration”), subject to any applicable withholding taxes; and
•
each Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than $56.00 will, to the extent not
exercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled at the Effective Time with
no payment made therefor and will cease to represent a right to purchase shares of common stock.
RSUs and PRSUs
As a result of the Merger, each restricted stock unit that was granted pursuant to such applicable Equity Incentive
Plan and remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an “RSU”) and each RSU that was
granted pursuant to an Equity Incentive Plan, that is subject to vesting, in part or in whole, based on the achievement
of corporate performance goals that have not been satisfied as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “PRSU”) will be cancelled and automatically
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive $56.00, in cash, without interest, for each share of common
stock subject to the RSU or PRSU (the “RSU and PRSU Merger Consideration”), subject to any applicable
withholding taxes.
RSAs
As a result of the Merger, each restricted share of common stock that was issued under an Equity Incentive Plan that
remains outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an “RSA”) will become fully vested
and free of any applicable forfeiture restrictions, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and each such
share of common stock will cease to be outstanding and will be converted into the right to receive $56.00, in cash,
without interest (the “RSA Merger Consideration”), subject to any applicable withholding taxes.
ESPP
Simultaneously in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company: (i) caused any offering
period (or similar period during which shares of common stock may be purchased) in progress under the Company’s
2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended from time to time (the “ESPP”), as of the date of the Merger
Agreement to be the final offering period under the ESPP and to be terminated as of the date of the Merger
Agreement (the “Final Exercise Date”); (ii) made any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such shortened offering period (or similar period) as
a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP; and (iii) caused each participant’s
then-outstanding share purchase right under the ESPP (the “ESPP Rights”) to terminate as of the Final Exercise Date.
The Company will terminate the ESPP no later than the Effective Time.
On the Final Exercise Date, to the extent sufficient funds were credited as of such date under the ESPP within the
associated accumulated payroll withholding accounts for participants to fund a share purchase for a reasonable
number of shares of common stock, then such funds were used to purchase shares of common stock in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP, and otherwise the current offering period terminated without a final purchase. Each share
of common stock purchased under the ESPP prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled at the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration, subject to any applicable withholding taxes
(the “ESPP Merger Consideration”). No further ESPP Rights will be granted or exercised under the ESPP after the Final
Exercise Date.
As of the date of this proxy statement, there are no outstanding ESPP Rights.

delivery, the “Bring-Down Date”), the Company will deliver its certificate, and Parent will deliver its certificate.
Promptly following delivery of the certificates contemplated by the foregoing sentence (and no earlier than such

the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to contribute the equity of
CAL to a newly formed Bermuda exempted limited partnership (the “Contribution”).
One business day after the completion of the Contribution (and no earlier than one business day after the completion
of the Contribution), the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make
the Migration Filings, and thereafter effect the Migration as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Closing will not occur earlier than on the next
business day after the Company and Parent receive reasonably satisfactory evidence of the completion of the
Migration (including the occurrence of clause (ii) of the definition thereof with respect to each Migrating Subsidiary)

The consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. The Company and Parent estimate that the
total amount of funds required to complete the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby and pay related
fees and expenses will be approximately $1.1 billion, with the exact amount dependent upon the willingness of various
of the Company’s existing financing sources to consent to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

When considering the unanimous recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the Merger Proposal, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or
in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more fully described below. In (i) evaluating and negotiating
the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving and declaring the advisability of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii)
recommending that the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote adopt the Merger Agreement and directing that
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote for adoption, the Board was aware of and considered these interests to
the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests include the following:
•
Treatment of Company Equity Awards. Certain of our directors and executive officers hold equity awards,
the treatment of which is described in “The Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Options, RSUs, PRSUs and RSAs” beginning on page 66;
•
Severance Benefits. Our named executive officers are entitled to certain severance benefits under their
respective pre-existing employment or service agreements with us if their employment terminates in certain
circumstances, which are described in “The Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Employment Agreements and Service Agreement” beginning on page 68;
•
Employment Arrangements with Parent. Certain of our officers, including our named executive officers
(collectively, the “Key Executives”), have entered into binding term sheets with Parent (each, a “Term
Sheet” and, collectively, the “Term Sheets”), pursuant to which, among other things, such officers are
expected to continue their employment following the day on which the closing of the Merger (the
“Closing”) occurs (the “Closing Date”) and, in certain cases, receive increased salaries, as well as certain
cash bonus retention awards that are subject to vesting, in each chase, as further described in “The
Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Employment
Arrangements with Parent” beginning on page 69; and
•
Indemnification Rights. Our directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, our organizational documents and certain indemnification agreements,
as well as directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, which is described in “The Merger- Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and
Executive Officers” beginning on page 72.
If the Merger Proposal is approved, the shares held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same
manner as outstanding shares held by all other common stockholders. For more information, see “The Merger-
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 66.

As of the date of this proxy statement, assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the
approval by our common stockholders of the Merger Proposal, the completion of the Migration and receipt of
regulatory approval, the Merger is expected to be completed in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2021.
However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the
closing conditions, including the completion of the Migration, each as described in “The Merger Agreement-
Conditions to the Contribution, Migration Filings and Merger” beginning on page 102, many of which are outside of
our control.

After considering various factors described in “The Merger-Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the
Merger” beginning on page 54 and after consultation with the Company’s legal and financial advisors, the Board
unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (ii) adopted resolutions approving and declaring the advisability of
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, on the terms and conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) adopted resolutions recommending that the stockholders of the Company

thereby, including the Merger, be submitted to the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote for adoption (the

The Company retained Centerview Partners LLC (“Centerview)” as financial advisor to the Board in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which are collectively referred to as
the “Transaction” throughout this section and the summary of Centerview’s opinion below under the caption “The
Merger-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC” beginning on page 59. In connection with this engagement, the Board
requested that Centerview evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of the
Company’s common stock (other than (a) any shares of Company common stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or
any other subsidiary or affiliate of Parent, (b) any shares of Company common stock for which appraisal rights have
been properly demanded, perfected and not withdrawn or lost under Section 262 of the DGCL, and (c) any shares of
Company common stock owned by the Company in treasury or by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary or
affiliate of the Company, which are collectively referred to as “Excluded Common Shares” throughout this section and
the summary of Centerview’s opinion below under the caption “Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC”) of the $56.00
per share Common Merger Consideration proposed to be paid to holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. On June 17, 2021, Centerview rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 17, 2021 that, as of June 17, 2021 and based upon and subject
to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the
review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the Common Merger Consideration proposed to be paid to
the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
holders of shares of common stock (other than Excluded Common Shares).
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion, dated June 17, 2021, which describes the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in
preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B and is incorporated herein by reference. Centerview’s financial
advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Board (in their capacity as
directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for purposes of its consideration of the Transaction
and Centerview’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date thereof, to the
holders of shares of common stock (other than Excluded Common Shares) of the Common Merger Consideration to
be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Centerview’s opinion did not address the consideration
proposed to be paid to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the fairness of
the Common Merger Consideration relative to the consideration proposed to be paid to the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the allocation of the aggregate Merger Consideration among
the holders of shares of common stock and holders of shares of Preferred Stock or any other term or aspect of the
Merger Agreement or the Transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the
Company or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the Merger or
otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.

information relating to the Company or any subsidiary to, any third party that is seeking to make, has made
or could reasonably be expected to make, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) except where the Board (or a
committee thereof) makes a good faith determination, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law, grant any waiver under any standstill agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (iii) enter into any agreement (including any letter of intent or term
sheet) relating to any Alternative Proposal.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Board is prohibited from effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change (as defined in “The Merger Agreement-Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation; Intervening
Events” beginning on page 94), subject to the exceptions described below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the Board (or a committee thereof),
directly or indirectly through any representative, may (i) engage in negotiations with any third party that has made
(and not withdrawn) a bona fide Alternative Proposal in writing that was not solicited in violation of the restrictions
set forth above and that the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
(as defined in “The Merger Agreement-Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation; Intervening Events”
beginning on page 94), and (ii) enter into, and furnish to the third party non-public information relating to the
Company or any subsidiary pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement or (iii) subject to compliance with the
additional obligations described below, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. In such event, the
Company is required to have promptly notified Parent after it obtains knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or
any of its representatives) of any Alternative Proposal, of any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Alternative Proposal or its receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the material terms thereof and have provided Parent
prior written notice that it intends to take such action, and the Board (or a committee thereof) is required to have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Change, subject to the following exceptions (and as more fully described in “The Merger Agreement-Alternative
Proposals; Change in Recommendation; Intervening Events” beginning on page 94):
•
The Board (or any committee thereof) may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Alternative Proposal if it complies with certain requirements, including, but not limited to,
complying with its obligations set forth in “-Alternative Proposals,” providing Parent at least four business
days prior written notice of its intent to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, negotiating
with Parent in good faith to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that
the Alternative Proposal leading to the proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, providing Parent with notice of any material amendments or material
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof, determining in good faith, after
consulting with outside legal counsel and the Company’s financial advisor, that such Alternative Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent to
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and, in the case of a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with the Company’s entry into, or public announcement of its

response to an Intervening Event (as defined in “The Merger Agreement-Alternative Proposals; Change in

including, but not limited to, promptly notifying Parent, privately and in writing, at least two business days
(the “Company Adverse Recommendation Notice Period”) before effecting the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, and which notice must include a reasonably detailed description of the
underlying facts giving rise to the Intervening Event, and the reasons for taking, such action and
negotiating in good faith with Parent during the Company Adverse Recommendation Notice Period to make
such adjustments to the Merger Agreement so that the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for
taking such action, cease to constitute an Intervening Event, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes in good
faith to make such adjustments. Furthermore, the Board must determine in good faith, after consulting with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor and taking into account any adjustments made by Parent
during the Company Adverse Recommendation Notice Period, that the failure to effect such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. For

If the Merger is approved by our common stockholders and becomes effective, holders of Dissenting Shares (as
defined in “The Merger-Merger Consideration” beginning on page 37 of this proxy statement) will be entitled to

Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined
to be the fair value. The ultimate amount holders receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or
more than the amount such holders would have received under the Merger Agreement. For a description of the rights
of holders of Dissenting Shares and of the procedures to be followed in order to assert such rights and obtain
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, see Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached as Annex C to

FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL, IF YOU SUBMIT A PROXY AND WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR
APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU MUST INCLUDE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTE YOUR SHARES AGAINST,

VOTE, NEITHER VOTING AGAINST THE MERGER PROPOSAL, NOR ABSTAINING FROM VOTING OR
FAILING TO VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL, WILL IN AND OF ITSELF CONSTITUTE A WRITTEN
DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. THE
WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL MUST BE IN ADDITION TO AND SEPARATE FROM ANY PROXY OR
VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES THROUGH A BROKER, BANK, TRUSTEE
OR OTHER NOMINEE AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH
YOUR BROKER, BANK, TRUSTEE OR OTHER NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES
FOR THE MAKING OF A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL BY SUCH BROKER, BANK, TRUSTEE OR OTHER

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 78) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares
in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger (computed as if there were no applicable
withholding taxes) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered in the Merger. Gain or loss
realized generally must be calculated separately for each block of shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a
single transaction) surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 78) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax with respect to the exchange of shares for cash in the Merger, unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain
connections to the United States.
The determination of actual tax consequences of the Merger to a holder will depend on the holder’s specific
situation. For more information, see “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”
beginning on page 78. Holders of shares should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax
consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under
U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

The closing price of our common stock on the NYSE, on June 17, 2021, the last trading day prior to the announcement
of the Merger, was $38.16 per share. On August 3, 2021, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement
was mailed to our common stockholders, the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE was $55.87 per share.
You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our common stock in connection with voting your
shares.
Our Board approved the initiation of a regular cash dividend on our common stock at a rate of $0.25 per share per
quarter, equivalent to $1.00 per share annually, effective during the third quarter of 2020. The dividend was increased
to $0.30 per share effective the first quarter of 2021. In addition, under the terms of the certificates of designations for
our Preferred Stock, we pay quarterly dividends on our Preferred Stock, in each case, at an annual rate of 8.50% of the
$25.00 liquidation preference per annum. The Merger Agreement does not restrict our ability to declare, set aside or
pay dividends on our Preferred Stock and on our common stock (not to exceed $0.30 per share of common stock per
quarter), solely to the extent made on payment dates that correspond to record dates on June 28, 2021, September 27,
2021, and December 27, 2021 between signing and Closing under the Merger Agreement.

Since the announcement of the Merger, two lawsuits have been filed by alleged Company stockholders. The first
lawsuit was filed on July 14, 2021 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and is
captioned Stein v. CAI International, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-06034. The second lawsuit was filed on July 16, 2021 in
the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Whitfield v. CAI International, Inc., et
al., No. 2:21-cv-13753-BRM-MAH. Both lawsuits name the Company and the Board as defendants. Both lawsuits
allege, among other things, that the defendants violated provisions of the Exchange Act because the Company's
preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, dated July 12, 2021, allegedly omits material information with respect to
the transactions contemplated therein and is therefore false and misleading. The lawsuits seek, among other things,
injunctive relief, rescissory damages, and awards of plaintiffs' fees and expenses.

The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger
Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be
important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy
statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents we refer to, or incorporate by reference, in this

Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form?
A:
On June 17, 2021, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. You are receiving this proxy statement and form of proxy card or voting
instruction form in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board in favor of the Merger Proposal and
the other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting. This proxy statement describes matters on which we
urge you to vote and is intended to assist you in deciding how to vote your shares with respect to those
matters.
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
A:
The proposed transaction is the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. Following the Effective Time, the Company would be privately held as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent.
Q:
What will I receive in the Merger?
A:
If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $56.00, in cash, without interest, subject to deductions
of any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own. For example, if you own
100 shares of common stock, you will be entitled to receive $5,600, in cash in exchange for your shares of
common stock, without interest, subject to deductions of any applicable withholding taxes. In addition, the
holders our Preferred Stock will receive the liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus the aggregate amount
of all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Preferred Stock that they own as of the Effective Time, in cash,
without interest, subject to deductions of any applicable withholding taxes. Neither you, nor the holders of our
Preferred Stock, will be entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Parent.
Q:
What will the holders of Options, RSUs, PRSUs, RSAs and ESPP Rights receive in the Merger?
A:
The Board has taken such actions as are necessary to cause (i) the performance conditions of each PRSU to be
deemed satisfied at 100% of the relevant target level of achievement (notwithstanding any contrary provision in
any agreement or document governing or evidencing the relevant PRSU) and (ii) each Option, PRSU, RSU and
RSA to become fully vested and free of any applicable forfeiture restrictions, in each of clauses (i) and (ii),
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
As a result of the Merger:
•
each Option that has a per share exercise price that is less than the Common Merger Consideration, will be
cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to such Option multiplied by (y) the excess of
$56.00 over the applicable per share exercise price of the Option, subject to any applicable withholding
taxes;
•
each Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than $56.00 will, to the extent not
exercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled at the Effective Time with
no payment made therefor and will cease to represent a right to purchase shares of common stock;
•
each RSU and PRSU will be cancelled and automatically converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive $56.00, in cash, without interest, for each share of common stock subject to the RSU or PRSU,
subject to any applicable withholding taxes; and
•
each RSA will become fully vested and free of any applicable forfeiture restrictions, effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and each such share of common stock will cease to be outstanding
and will be converted into the right to receive $56.00, in cash, without interest, subject to any applicable
withholding taxes.
18TABLE OF CONTENTS
As of the date of this proxy statement, there are no outstanding ESPP Rights.
Q:
How does the Common Merger Consideration compare to the market price of the common stock?
A:
The relationship of the Common Merger Consideration to the trading price of our common stock on the NYSE
constituted a premium of approximately (i) 47% over the closing share price of our common stock on the NYSE
on June 17, 2021, the last trading day prior to the date the Merger Agreement was publicly announced, and (ii)
31% over the volume weighted average price of our common stock on the NYSE during the 60 trading days up
to, and including, June 17, 2021.

To attend and participate in the Special Meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your
proxy card or on the instructions that accompanied your proxy materials. If your shares are held in “street
name,” you should contact your broker, trustee or other nominee to obtain your 16-digit control number or
otherwise vote through the broker, trustee or other nominee. Only common stockholders with a valid 16-digit
control number, will be able to attend the Special Meeting and vote, ask questions and access the list of

at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time. Online check-in will begin at 9:45 a.m., Pacific Time, and you should allow ample time
for the online check-in procedures. Instructions on how to attend and participate online are also posted online

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website, to ensure that your
shares will be represented at the Special Meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy
card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy prior to the Special Meeting electronically
over the Internet at www.proxycote.com or by telephone at 1-800-690-6903. If you attend the Special Meeting
and vote via the Virtual Special Meeting Website, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted by you
with respect to the shares so voted via the Virtual Special Meeting Website.
If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to
vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your broker, bank,
trustee or other nominee. Your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals,
including the Merger Proposal, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not
vote your shares at the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website unless you obtain a valid proxy
from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Holders of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of, and to vote
at, the Special Meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Therefore, a total of
17,357,549 votes are eligible to be cast at the Special Meeting.
The vote of the holders of our Preferred Stock is not required to approve any of the proposals at the Special
Meeting and is not being solicited.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and
•
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will be, or may become, payable to
our named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What vote of our common stockholders is required to approve the Merger Proposal?
A:
Under the DGCL, stockholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting on the Record Date must affirmatively vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. In
addition, under the Merger Agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of
the Merger. A failure to vote your shares, an abstention from voting or a broker non-vote will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special
Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, we do not expect any
broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What vote is required to approve each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal?
A:
Approval of each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares present in person (including by means of remote communication) or represented by
proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date.
The failure of any common stockholder of record to (i) submit a signed proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy over the
Internet or by telephone; or (iii) vote via the Virtual Special Meeting Website at the Special Meeting will not
have any effect on either the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. If you hold your shares in
“street name,” the failure to instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to vote your shares will not
have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. However, abstentions will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal.
Q:
What is “Merger-related compensation”?
A:
“Merger-related compensation” is certain compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and
may become payable to our named executive officers under our existing plans or agreements, which is the
subject of the Compensation Proposal. See “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive
Officer Compensation” beginning on page 110.
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve “Merger-related compensation” payable
to CAI’s named executive officers under its plans or agreements?
A:
In accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing you with the
opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What will happen if the common stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special
Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with
respect to the Compensation Proposal is on an advisory basis and will not be binding on CAI or Parent. Further,
the underlying compensation plans and agreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject
to stockholder approval. Accordingly, payment of the “Merger-related compensation” is not contingent on
common stockholder approval of the Compensation Proposal.
Q:
How many votes am I entitled to cast for each share that I own?
A:
Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share.
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What is a quorum?
A:
A quorum is necessary to hold a valid Special Meeting. A quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting on the Record Date are
represented via the Virtual Special Meeting Website or by proxy, regardless of whether the proxy has authority
to vote on the Merger Proposal. If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the Special Meeting may be
adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.
If you submit a proxy but abstain or fail to provide voting instructions on any of the proposals listed on the
proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the
Special Meeting.
If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee and you do not tell your
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to vote your shares, these shares will not be counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Board unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR”
the Adjournment Proposal and “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.
Q:
Why is the Board recommending that I vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal?
A:
After careful consideration and after consultation with the Company’s legal and financial advisors, the Board
unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (ii) adopted resolutions approving and declaring the advisability
of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) adopted resolutions recommending that the stockholders
of the Company entitled to vote adopt the Merger Agreement and directing that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, be submitted to the stockholders of the Company
entitled to vote for adoption. In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and to unanimously
recommend approval of each of the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation
Proposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as the Company’s legal and financial advisors, and
considered the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board also considered each of the items set forth under
“The Merger-Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 54.
Q:
What effects will the Merger have on the Company?
A:
Our common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the NYSE under the symbol
“CAI.” In addition, our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock are currently registered under
the Exchange Act and quoted on the NYSE under the symbols “CAI-PA” and “CAI-PB,” respectively. As a
result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be wholly-owned by
Parent. Following the consummation of the Merger, the registration of our common stock (and our Preferred
Stock) and our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act will be terminated. In addition, upon the
consummation of the Merger, our common stock (and our Preferred Stock) will no longer be listed on any stock
exchange or quotation system, including the NYSE.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
A:
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the required vote of our common stockholders, or if the Merger is not
consummated for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection
with the Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company and shares of our common stock (and
Preferred Stock) will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and
we will continue to file periodic and current reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we
expect that management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today
and that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently
subject, including, among other things, the risks described in the risk factors included in our filings with the
SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on
March 1, 2021, which is incorporated by reference herein, as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC.
21
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Furthermore, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our
common stock may decline significantly, and if that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our
common stock would return to the price at which it traded as of the date of this proxy statement or reach the
price level of the Common Merger Consideration.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares. If the Merger is not completed, the Board will continue to
evaluate and review our business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will
make such changes, if any, as are deemed appropriate. If the Merger Proposal is not approved by common
stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other
transaction acceptable to the Board will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will
not be adversely impacted.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay to Parent the
Termination Fee of $35.0 million or Parent may be required to pay us the Parent Termination Fee of $35.0 million.
Furthermore, upon any termination of the Merger Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee is payable, the paying party will, in addition to payment of the Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, be required to pay the Merger Agreement Expenses in an amount not to
exceed $5.0 million. See “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Treatment of Expenses” beginning on
page 107.
Finally, if the Merger does not close, we would cause our subsidiaries to engage in a series of transactions such
that our position would be as if the Migration had not occurred in all material respects. See “The Merger
Agreement-The Migration” beginning on page 82.
Q:
What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares?
A:
We urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents referred to, or
incorporated by reference, in this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger affects you. Your vote is
important. If you are a common stockholder of record, that is, if your shares are registered in your name with
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent, there are four ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting and voting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website (however, simply
attending the Special Meeting will not cause your shares to be voted).
A 16-digit control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and to confirm that
your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by
telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically
over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which
you will be responsible.
To vote your shares during the Special Meeting, click on the vote button provided on the screen and follow the
instructions provided. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the Special Meeting during the check-in or
Special Meeting time, please call the technical support number that will be posted on the log in page.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website, you are strongly
encouraged to vote your shares by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a valid proxy to vote shares
that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares at the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting
Website even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote via the
Virtual Special Meeting Website, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you may vote through
your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other
nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone prior to the
Special Meeting through your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the
22
TABLE OF CONTENTS
voting form provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee. Your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee
cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the Merger Proposal, without your instructions. If you hold your
shares in “street name,” you may not vote your shares at the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting
Website unless you obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee.
Q:
What happens if I do not vote?
A:
The vote on the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to vote at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
The vote to approve each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal is based on the total
number of outstanding shares of common stock present in person (including by means of remote
communication) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the Special Meeting. If you do
not vote, it will have no effect on either the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. If you hold your shares in certificated form and in your name as a stockholder of record, then shortly after
the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal from the paying agent for the Merger with
detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares for the applicable Merger Consideration. If your shares
are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your
“street name” shares in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Do not send in your certificates, if
any, now or with your proxy card.
Q:
I hold my shares in certificated form but do not know where my stock certificate is-how will I get the applicable
Merger Consideration for my shares?
A:
If the Merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the Merger will
include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate, including signing an
affidavit attesting to the loss of your stock certificate. The paying agent may also require that you provide a
bond in customary amount or an indemnity agreement in order to cover any potential loss.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares before completion of the Merger?
A:
If you transfer your shares, you will have transferred your right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
in the Merger. In order to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares through
completion of the Merger.
The Record Date for common stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the
consummation of the Merger. If you transfer your shares after the Record Date but before the closing of the
Merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in the Merger, but
retained the right to vote at the Special Meeting.
Q:
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the applicable Merger Consideration for my
shares?
A:
Dissenting stockholders of record, which includes both holders of shares of common stock and Preferred Stock,
as applicable, as registered in the records of the Company, who do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal (to
the extent they are entitled to vote on the Merger Proposal) and otherwise comply with the requirements of
Section 262 of the DGCL are entitled to statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the
Merger. This means that if you comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, you are entitled to
have the “fair value” (as defined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as
Annex C to this proxy statement) of your shares determined in accordance with Delaware law and to receive
payment based on that valuation instead of receiving the applicable Merger Consideration. The ultimate amount
you would receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more than, the same as or less than the amount you would
have received under the Merger Agreement. Failure to strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL may result
in your waiver of, or inability to exercise, appraisal rights. See “The Merger-Appraisal Rights” beginning on
page 73 and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute, Section 262 of the DGCL, which is reproduced
23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal (to the extent they are
entitled to vote on the Merger Proposal), you will waive your appraisal rights, unless you revoke your proxy, if
revocable, prior to the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting and otherwise comply with Section 262 of the
DGCL.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.,
you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy
statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.
If your shares are held through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial
owner” of shares held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of
record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to
vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting
via the Virtual Special Meeting Website. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not
via the Virtual Special Meeting Website. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not
vote your shares at the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website unless you obtain a valid proxy
from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently
scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other
nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee
to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the
same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on either the Adjournment
Proposal or the Compensation Proposal.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, which we refer to as a “proxy holder,” to vote your shares.
The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a
“proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares is called a “proxy card.”
Timothy B. Page, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director, and Steven J.
Garcia, our Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting, with full power of
substitution.
Q:
Can I revoke my proxy?
A:
Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. If you are a common
stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company’s Secretary in writing at Steuart
Tower, 1 Market Plaza, Suite 2400, San Francisco, California 94105, or by submitting a new proxy by telephone,
the Internet or mail, in each case, dated after the date of the proxy being revoked. In addition, you may revoke
your proxy by attending the Special Meeting and voting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website (however,
simply attending the Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked). Please note that if you hold your
shares in “street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee to vote your shares,
the above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you must follow
the instructions received from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions.
Q:
If a common stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you use to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate.
When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares
should be voted “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of
business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (2)
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.
24
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
How are votes counted?
A:
For the Merger Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions and broker non-
votes, if any, will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” this proposal.
For the Adjournment Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on this proposal.
For the Compensation Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on this proposal.
Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may
have discretionary authority to vote, we do not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy
card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one
brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you
hold shares. If you are a common stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name,
you will receive more than one proxy card.
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
We have engaged Georgeson LLC (“Georgeson”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting.
We estimate that we will pay Georgeson a fee of approximately $20,000 and will reimburse Georgeson for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify it and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses,
damages and expenses. We may also reimburse brokers, banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries
representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners
and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit
proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional
amounts for soliciting proxies.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
We intend to publish the final voting results of the Special Meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed
with the SEC within four business days after the Special Meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are
publicly available when filed. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 117.
Q:
Will I have to pay taxes on the applicable Merger Consideration I receive?
A:
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. You are urged to read “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 78 for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger. Because individual circumstances may differ, you are urged to consult your own
tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the exchange of shares for cash pursuant to the
Merger, in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or
foreign income and other tax laws).
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more
stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received and only if the applicable stockholder
provides advance notice and follows certain procedures.
In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain
brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through
brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received
25
TABLE OF CONTENTS
a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or
require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this
proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision
to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
For more information, please see “Householding” beginning on page 116.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as reasonably practicable. Assuming timely
satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by our common stockholders of the Merger
Proposal and completion of the Migration, we currently expect to complete the Merger in the late third quarter or
early fourth quarter of 2021. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because
the Merger is subject to the closing conditions, including completion of the Migration, each as described in
“The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Contribution, Migration Filings and Merger” beginning on page 102,
many of which are outside of our control.
Q:
If the Merger is completed, how will I receive the cash for my shares?
A:
If the Merger is completed and you are not exercising appraisal rights and your shares are held in book-entry,
the paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action
on your part. If the Merger is completed and you are not exercising appraisal rights, and you are a stockholder of
record with your shares held in certificated form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how
to send your shares to the paying agent in connection with the Merger. The paying agent will issue and deliver
to you a check or wire transfer for your shares after you comply with these instructions. Please do not send your
stock certificates with your proxy card. See “The Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures”
beginning on page 87.
If the Merger is completed and you are not exercising appraisal rights, and your shares are held in “street name”
by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank, trustee or
other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of, and receive payment for, your shares held in “street name.”
Q:
What happens if the market price of shares of our common stock significantly changes before the Closing?
A:
Parent is not obligated to change the Common Merger Consideration as a result of a change in the market price
of our common stock.
Q:
Do any of the Company’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of the
Company’s stockholders generally?
A:
In considering the unanimous recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii)
approving and declaring the advisability of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) recommending
that the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote adopt the Merger Agreement and directing that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote for adoption, the Board was aware of and considered these
interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see “The Merger-
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 66.
Q:
Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
A:
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. For further details, see
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 28.
Q:
Who can help answer my other questions?
A:
If you have more questions about the Merger, require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares
or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Georgeson, which is
acting as our proxy solicitor in connection with the Merger.

Only holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on August 2, 2021, the Record Date for the
Special Meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof. As of the Record Date, 17,357,549 shares of common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting.
Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Therefore, a total of 17,357,549 votes are eligible to be
cast at the Special Meeting.
The vote of the holders of our Preferred Stock is not required to approve any of the proposals at the Special Meeting
and is not being solicited.
The quorum requirement for holding the Special Meeting and transacting business is that holders of a majority of
shares of our common stock entitled to vote must be present in person (including by means of remote
communication) or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present for the
purpose of determining whether a quorum is present, however “broker non-votes” (as described below under the
sub-heading “-Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes”), if any, will not be counted as present for the
purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. If your shares are held in “street name”
by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee and you do not tell your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to
vote your shares, these shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the
transaction of business at the Special Meeting.
Treasury shares, which are shares owned by the Company itself, are not voted and do not count for this purpose.
Once a share is represented at the Special Meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the
Special Meeting. However, if a new Record Date is set for an adjourned Special Meeting, then a new quorum will have
to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of
shares considered to be present at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes, if any, will not be considered to be present

For the Company to complete the Merger, under the DGCL, stockholders holding at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting on the Record Date must affirmatively
vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. In addition, under the Merger Agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a
condition to the consummation of the Merger. A failure to vote your shares, an abstention from voting or a broker
non-vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Approval of each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares present in person (including by means of remote communication) or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote on such proposal at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date. Abstentions will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal but the failure to vote your
shares and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of either the Adjournment Proposal or the
Compensation Proposal.
In accordance with NYSE rules, brokers, banks, trustees or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for their
customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to any of the proposals at the Special
Meeting. Accordingly, if brokers, banks, trustees or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from
the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with respect to any of the proposals at the
Special Meeting. Under such circumstance, a “broker non-vote” would arise. Broker non-votes, if any, will not be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting and will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on either the Adjournment Proposal or the
Compensation Proposal. For shares held in “street name,” only shares affirmatively voted “FOR” the Merger
Proposal will be counted as a favorable vote for such proposal. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the
Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, we do not expect any
broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.
Shares Held by the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of the Record Date, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned and were entitled to
vote, in the aggregate, 1,409,813 shares of common stock, or approximately 8.1% of the aggregate shares of common
stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. The directors and executive officers of the Company have informed the
Company that they currently intend to vote all of their shares “FOR” each of the proposals to be considered and
voted on at the Special Meeting.

To ensure that your shares are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions
promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting via the Virtual Special Meeting Website.
Shares Held by Record Holder. If you are a common stockholder of record, you may submit a proxy using one of the
methods described below:
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with
instructions for submitting votes by telephone or via the Internet. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free
number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address as specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares will
be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as
described below.
Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in
time for the Special Meeting, your shares will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card. If you sign,
date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of
the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal. If you are a common stockholder of
record and fail to return your proxy card, unless you are a holder of record on the Record Date and attend the Special
Meeting and vote via the Virtual Special Meeting Website, the effect will be that your shares will not be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting and will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will not affect the vote regarding either the Adjournment Proposal or the
Compensation Proposal.
Shares Held in “Street Name.” If your shares are held by a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee on your behalf in
“street name,” your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting
instructions for your shares. Many banks and brokerage firms have a process for their customers to provide voting
instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions via a voting instruction
form.
In accordance with NYSE rules, brokers, banks, trustees or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for their
customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the Merger Proposal, the
Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks, trustees or other nominees do
not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with
respect to the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. Under such circumstance,
a “broker non-vote” would arise. Broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a
quorum is present at the Special Meeting and will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal,
but will have no effect on either the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. For shares held in “street
name,” only shares affirmatively voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal will be counted as a favorable vote for such
proposal. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers
may have discretionary authority to vote, we do not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.

described above, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company;

If the Merger is approved and becomes effective, holders of shares of common stock who have not voted in favor of
the Merger and holders of shares of Preferred Stock, as applicable, who have properly demanded statutory appraisal
rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have complied in all respects with
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to statutory appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders are entitled to seek appraisal of their Dissenting
Shares and to receive payment in cash for the “fair value” of such Dissenting Shares, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The ultimate
amount holders receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount such holders
would have received under the Merger Agreement. For a description of the rights of holders of Dissenting Shares
and of the procedures to be followed in order to assert such rights and obtain payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares, see Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and
incorporated by reference herein, as well as the information set forth below. A summary of stockholders’ appraisal
rights under the DGCL is provided under “The Merger-Appraisal Rights.”

If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the required vote of our common stockholders, or if the Merger is not
consummated for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with
the Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company, shares of our common stock (and Preferred
Stock) will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue
to file periodic and current reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that
management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that
stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject,
including, among other things, the risks described in the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC, including
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021, which is
incorporated by reference herein, as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC.
If the Merger does not close, we would cause our subsidiaries to engage in a series of transactions such that our
position would be as if the Migration had not occurred in all material respects.
Furthermore, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our common
stock may decline significantly, and if that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock
would return to the price at which it traded as of the date of this proxy statement or reach the price level of the
Common Merger Consideration.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares. If the Merger is not completed, the Board will continue to evaluate
and review our business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such
changes, if any, as are deemed appropriate. If the Merger Proposal is not approved by common stockholders or if the
Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the
Board will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay to Parent the
Termination Fee of $35.0 million or Parent may be required to pay us the Parent Termination Fee of $35.0 million.
Furthermore, upon any termination of the Merger Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee is payable, the paying party will, in addition to payment of the Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, be required to pay the Merger Agreement Expenses in an amount not to exceed $5.0
million. See “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Treatment of Expenses.”

Background of the Merger",50,51
"CAI International, Inc._20210804_DEFM14A_19444962_4270736.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Board and the senior management team of the Company regularly review the Company’s performance, future
growth prospects, business composition, use of capital and overall strategic direction, with the objective of
maximizing long-term stockholder value. At various times, these reviews have included consideration of a variety of
strategic alternatives as an independent company, including potential changes to the Company’s operating
segments, as well as potential transactions with third parties. As part of the Board review process, independent
directors have regularly engaged with the Company’s stockholders, soliciting their input on key matters, including
corporate governance, the strategic direction of the Company, and other important stockholder interests.
In connection with the Board’s reviews and stockholder interactions, the Board and senior management have taken a
number of actions to enhance stockholder value. Such actions have included investment in the Company’s earning
assets when market conditions were deemed favorable, while deferring investment when market conditions were
deemed more challenged, continued review of the Company’s capital structure and prevailing interest rates to
opportunistically raise capital, and consistent evaluation of the Company’s capital return policy. Since 2020, the
Company has effectively streamlined the business, returning to a pure-play container lessor following the disposition
of the Company’s logistics and rail businesses in 2020. Since 2018, the Company has repurchased approximately 14%
of its outstanding shares of common stock and, in June 2020, enhanced its capital return program with the initiation
of a regular cash dividend on the Company’s common stock at a rate of $1.00 per share annually, which has since
been increased 20% to $1.20 per share annually, effective the first quarter of 2021.
Between June 2019 and December 2019, representatives of the Company received various communications from, and
held a number of in person, video and telephonic meetings with, representatives of certain of the Company’s then-
largest stockholders to discuss stockholder concerns and opinions. In these communications and calls, among other
things, representatives of such stockholders: (i) expressed concern regarding the Company’s depressed stock price
to book value ratio, at one point noting that, in one such stockholder’s calculation, the Company’s common stock
was trading at a 30% discount to book value, (ii) expressed concern regarding the strategic direction of the Company
and other operational matters, including repeated desire for the Company to sell its rail and logistics businesses, (iii)
repeatedly encouraged the Board to engage a financial advisor to review all strategic alternatives, including, but not
limited to, a sale of the Company via an auction process and repurchasing shares on a larger scale, (iv) communicated
that the Company’s share price did not reflect the intrinsic value of the Company, and (v) stated that, unless the
Company retained an investment bank to assist with a strategic alternatives review process to maximize stockholder
value, certain of such stockholders would consider all available options, including making their concerns public,
nominating their own slate of directors for stockholder consideration at the next election of directors, and engaging a
proxy solicitor and a law firm to represent such stockholder in a potential proxy contest. During this time, the
Company’s representatives emphasized to representatives of such stockholders that the Board was committed to
fulfilling its fiduciary duty of acting in the best interest of the Company’s stockholders.
As part of its regular consideration of potential opportunities to strengthen the Company’s business and maximize
long-term stockholder value, and taking into account communications from stockholders during this timeframe, the
Board held various meetings at which the Board, among other things: (i) considered and reviewed the viewpoints of
such stockholders in deciding whether to initiate a strategic alternatives process, including the timing of any public
announcement thereof, (ii) discussed the repeated pressure such stockholders were putting on the
39TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company to engage a financial advisor, (iii) received presentations from representatives of Perkins Coie LLP, the
Company’s primary outside legal counsel (“Perkins Coie”), and Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP, the Company’s
outside Delaware legal counsel (“Potter Anderson”), regarding, among other things, the Board’s fiduciary duties in a
strategic alternative review process, (iv) authorized each of David Remington, the Company’s Chairman of the Board,
and Victor Garcia, the Company’s then-current President, Chief Executive Officer and director, to interview various
investment banks to potentially serve as the Company’s financial advisor to advise the Company in connection with
(a) activist and other stockholder proposals, both formal and informal, and (b) analyze and consider various strategic
and financial alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company and the optimal timing and availability of any
other alternatives to maximize stockholder value for the Company, and (v) engaged a public relations firm to assist in
stockholder outreach.
Between June 15, 2019 and September 11, 2019, the Company’s representatives contacted and interviewed four
investment banks, including Centerview, regarding an engagement as the Company’s financial advisor. During
various meetings with such investment banks, representatives of such investment banks discussed their respective
qualifications as well as proposed approaches for the Company to maximize stockholder value. The Company’s
representatives asked questions and received answers from such investment banks.
On June 20, 2019, as part of the Board’s commitment to stockholder responsiveness and maximizing stockholder
value, the Company sold $15.8 million of rail cars from its railcar leasing portfolio to The InStar Group (“InStar”). The
Company had also previously sold $39.6 million of railcars from its railcar leasing portfolio to Exxon Mobil
Corporation on November 30, 2018, and $165.3 million of railcars from its railcar leasing portfolio to InStar on February
26, 2019.
On August 7, 2019, the Company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of
2019 and announcing its intention to sell its remaining rail fleet. The Company’s common stock closed trading at
$21.30 per share on the NYSE.
From August 19, 2019 through September 20, 2019, without the Board’s knowledge or authorization, Mr. Garcia, in his
individual capacity, had discussions with third parties regarding a potential management buy-out or take-private
transaction of the Company (collectively, the “MBO Activities”).
On September 4, 2019, after further review of materials from potential financial advisors and conversations with such
parties, Mr. Remington advised the Board via email that he and Mr. Garcia recommended that the Board engage
Centerview as the Company’s financial advisor. The rest of the Board informally approved and agreed with the
engagement, with the formal approval occurring at a meeting of the Board on September 11, 2019, and the Company
entering into an engagement letter with Centerview to serve as the Company’s financial advisor on September 13,
2019.
On September 7, 2019, the Board held a meeting by teleconference, which was also attended by representatives of
Company management, representatives of Centerview, a representative of Perkins Coie, and representatives of Joele
Frank Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher, the Company’s public relations firm (“Joele Frank”). The purpose of the meeting
was to, among other things, have a representative of Perkins Coie refresh the Board on prior discussions with Potter
Anderson and with Perkins Coie regarding the Board’s fiduciary duties, discuss whether to make a public
announcement regarding the strategic alternatives process, and discuss recent calls among Mr. Remington, Mr.
Garcia and certain of the Company’s then-largest stockholders. In addition, the Board discussed unsolicited inbound
interest in acquiring the Company in the form of a telephone call to Mr. Garcia from the chief executive officer of a
potential strategic buyer (“Party A”).
On September 11, 2019, the Board approved the engagement of Centerview as the Company’s financial advisor. The
Board had considered many factors in selecting a financial advisor, including relationships with other potential
strategic or financial buyers, relevant experience and reputation. In addition, the Board discussed all the financial
advisor candidates and Mr. Remington’s reasons for recommending Centerview.
Also, on September 11, 2019, Mr. Garcia responded to an unsolicited email from Mr. Kenji Yasuno, the Senior
Managing Executive Officer of what was then Mitsubishi UFJ Lease and Finance Company Limited (the former name
of Parent), which owned MUL Railcars, Inc. (“MUL Railcar”), a competitor of the Company’s rail business, and
Beacon Intermodal Leasing, LLC (“Beacon”), a competitor of the Company’s container business, in which Mr. Yasuno
requested a meeting to learn more about the Company. Later that day, Mr. Garcia accepted Mr. Yasuno’s
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
request for a meeting and a meeting among Messrs. Garcia, Timothy Page, the Company’s then-current Chief
Financial Officer and current President, Chief Executive Officer and director, Yasuno, and Toshio Oka, Executive
Officer and General Manager of Parent, was subsequently scheduled for October 9, 2019.
On September 13, 2019, the chief executive officer of Party A contacted Mr. Garcia stating that he wanted to discuss
combining the Company and Party A, and wanted to share his thoughts on benefits, potential structure and value. A
meeting was scheduled for October 1, 2019, and then rescheduled for November 13, 2019, with Mr. Remington and
Andrew Ogawa, a member of the Board.
On September 15, 2019, the chief executive officer of Party A accepted Mr. Garcia’s invitation for a meeting and said
that he would be joined by Party A’s lead independent director.
On September 17, 2019, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by Company management, and
a representative of Perkins Coie, Centerview and Joele Frank. The Board discussed the need to take an additional
impairment charge on the Company’s rail business assets due to continued deterioration of the railcar business and
underlying value of the railcar assets.
Between September 23, 2019 and September 26, 2019, members of the Board other than Mr. Garcia (the “Non-
Executive Directors”) held several meetings, certain of which were attended by representatives of Centerview, Perkins
Coie and Potter Anderson. Mr. Garcia was excluded from these meetings due to the conflicts of interest raised by the
MBO Activities. During such meetings, among other things, the Non-Employee Directors discussed the advantages
and disadvantages of public announcement of the retention of Centerview as a strategic advisor, and/or the
exploration of strategic alternatives, as well as the aforementioned communications from activist stockholders.
On September 28, 2019, Mr. Garcia sent an email to Mr. Yasuno, inviting Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka to dinner after their
scheduled meeting on October 9, 2019, which was accepted by Mr. Yasuno on September 29, 2019.
On September 30, 2019, the Non-Executive Directors met with Mr. Garcia to discuss the MBO Activities.
On October 9, 2019, the Non-Executive Directors held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a
representative of Perkins Coie. At this meeting, the Non-Executive Directors decided that it was in the best interest of
the Company and its stockholders to form a special committee of the Board to insulate the strategic alternatives
process from any participation by Mr. Garcia. All members of the Board (other than Mr. Garcia) were appointed to the
special committee (the “Special Committee”).
Subsequently, on October 9, 2019, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Page met and subsequently had dinner with Mr. Yasuno and
Mr. Oka of Parent, at which meeting Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka expressed interest in a potential acquisition of the
Company.
Later, on October 10, 2019, Mr. Garcia emailed Mr. Remington that he and Mr. Page had a meeting, followed by dinner,
with Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka. Mr. Garcia noted that this would be a normal visit to catch up, since Mr. Yasuno and
Mr. Oka were going to be in San Francisco, California in connection with visiting a San Francisco-based aircraft
lessor that Parent owned. Mr. Garcia said that Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka expressed interest in the Company’s rail
business and mentioned that Parent might be interested in combining the Company and Beacon. Mr. Garcia also
reported that he thanked Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka for their interest and duly noted their comment.
On October 11, 2019, Mr. Garcia advised Mr. Remington via email that he had received a call from another potential
strategic buyer (“Party B”).
On October 14, 2019, the Non-Executive Directors met with Mr. Garcia to deliver a written “walling off” protocol to
separate Mr. Garcia from all matters relating to the strategic alternatives process due to the MBO Activities.
Also, on October 29, 2019, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the third quarter of
2019. The Company’s common stock closed trading at $24.22 per share on the NYSE.
On October 30, 2019, Mr. Remington and John Williford, a member of the Board, met with two representatives of Party
B at Perkins Coie’s offices in San Francisco, California. At the meeting, Party B submitted a non-binding
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
indication of interest to purchase the Company, other than the Company’s rail assets, at a price of $26 to $30 per
share. The non-binding indication of interest was also sent via email just before the meeting to Mr. Garcia, Mr.
Remington and Mr. Williford. At the close of business on October 30, 2019, the Company’s common stock closed
trading at $23.77 per share on the NYSE.
On November 1, 2019, Mr. Oka emailed Mr. Garcia and said that he and Mr. Yasuno planned to visit San Francisco,
California on November 21, 2019 and would like to arrange another in-person meeting to discuss a potential
acquisition of the Company, including the rail business. Mr. Garcia responded and accepted the invitation and noted
that Mr. Page would also attend the meeting.
On November 3, 2019, Mr. Garcia sent an email to Mr. Remington advising him of the planned meeting with the
representatives of Parent on November 21, 2019 and invited Mr. Remington and other members of the Board to
participate in the meeting. It was subsequently decided that Mr. Remington and Mr. Williford would meet
representatives of Parent on November 21, 2019 to discuss Parent’s interest in acquiring the Company without Mr.
Garcia and Mr. Page, and that Mr. Garcia and Mr. Page would meet with representatives of Parent to discuss a sale of
the rail business in a separate meeting.
Between November 5, 2019 and February 26, 2020, the Company negotiated and entered into non-disclosure
agreements with potential bidders, including Party A, Party B, Party C (as defined below), Party D (as defined below)
and Parent.
On November 13, 2019, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa met with Party A’s chief executive officer and a member of
Party A’s board of directors at Perkins Coie’s San Francisco, California offices. At the meeting, Party A made a non-
binding offer to purchase the Company in the form of 50% cash and 50% Party A stock, with an aggregate value of
80% of the value of one share of Party A common stock for each share of the Company’s common stock. The
aggregate offer represented an approximate value of $27.50 per share of the Company’s common stock. The
Company’s common stock closed trading at $23.53 per share on the NYSE.
On November 14, 2019, the Special Committee held a meeting, which was also attended by Company management,
other than Mr. Garcia, and representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie. Centerview presented an analysis of the
Company’s strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the Company. The Special Committee discussed these
alternatives, including the aforementioned non-binding offers received from each of Party A and Party B. The Special
Committee concluded that both non-binding offers were inadequate. The Company’s common stock closed trading at
$23.19 per share on the NYSE on November 14, 2019. The meeting of the Special Committee was adjourned until the
next day.
On November 15, 2019, the Special Committee continued the meeting that began November 14, 2019, and Centerview
presented alternative ways for the Company to proceed with respect to the strategic alternatives process, including
expanding outreach beyond the parties that had made incoming inquiries. The Special Committee discussed, among
other things, whether it should instruct Centerview to widen its search and the potential responses to the non-
binding offers from each of Party A and Party B. The Special Committee requested that Centerview prepare and
provide to Mr. Remington, based on Centerview’s familiarity with the industry, a list of potential buyers with the
capacity to engage in a purchase of the Company to supplement the inbound interest. The Company’s common stock
closed trading at $23.28 per share on the NYSE.
On November 17, 2019, the Board adopted a resolution via unanimous written consent that, in light of the formation
of the Special Committee and its role in overseeing the Company’s review of strategic alternatives, Centerview would
report to, and only take instructions from, the Special Committee (as opposed to the Board, which included Mr.
Garcia).
On November 21, 2019, Mr. Remington and Mr. Williford met Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka of Parent at Perkins Coie’s
offices in San Francisco, California. At the meeting, Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka advised Mr. Remington and Mr. Williford
that Parent was interested in making an offer to purchase the Company, excluding rail, but that it would take one to
two additional months before an offer could be presented to the Board.
On November 26, 2019, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives
of Centerview and Perkins Coie. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss, among other things: (i) the Company’s
response to Party A’s offer; (ii) Party B’s bid and potential willingness to change its earlier-stated position and to
include the Company’s rail business in Party B’s offer; (iii) the meetings with Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka
42

of Parent; (iv) other matters related to a strategic alternatives process, including entering into non-disclosure
agreements, and the possible sale of the logistics business assets. In addition, Centerview presented its valuation
metrics and the Special Committee discussed the valuation analysis.
On December 4, 2019, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa had a telephonic meeting with Party A’s chief executive officer
and a member of Party A’s board of directors, during which Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa rejected Party A’s initial
bid because the Board felt it substantially and materially undervalued the Company given that the proposed implicit
value was less than the Company’s book value, less than the reasonably computed long-term economic value and the
fact that at the time the Company’s common stock was trading substantially below book value. Mr. Remington and
Mr. Ogawa also advised Party A that the Company had received multiple other unsolicited inbound offers. The
Company’s common stock closed trading at $24.05 per share on the NYSE.
On December 9, 2019, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a representative
of Perkins Coie. At the meeting, the Special Committee discussed whether it was appropriate and in the best interest
of the Company’s stockholders to publicly announce that the Company had engaged Centerview as its financial
advisor in connection with a strategic alternatives process.
On December 11, 2019, the Special Committee held a meeting at the Company’s San Francisco, California office, which
was also attended by representatives from Centerview and Joele Frank. At the meeting, the Special Committee
decided to make a public announcement of the engagement of Centerview as the Company’s financial advisor in
order to explore strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value.
On December 16, 2019, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company had engaged Centerview
as its financial advisor in order to explore strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. The Company’s
common stock closed trading at $28.95 per share on the NYSE.
On December 17, 2019, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a representative
of Perkins Coie, at which the Special Committee decided to discontinue efforts to sell the rail and logistics divisions
outside of the main strategic alternatives process.
On December 18, 2019, representatives of Centerview had an introductory call with representatives of a potential
financial sponsor buyer (“Party C”) following recent unsolicited inbound interest by Party C.
On December 19, 2019, Mr. Ogawa met with representatives of Party B in Tokyo, Japan. At the meeting,
representatives of Party B indicated, among other things, that they were interested in making an all-cash offer, would
like to acquire the Company as a platform and keep management in place and had engaged a financial advisor.
However, the representatives of Party B did not make an offer and no potential purchase price was mentioned.
On December 20, 2019, Mr. Ogawa met with representatives of Parent in Tokyo, Japan. At the meeting,
representatives of Parent indicated, among other things, that they were interested in making an all-cash offer, that
they believed the Company would be a great fit as part of Parent’s overall business and that they had engaged a
financial advisor.
On December 27, 2019, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington to advise him that Parent would be unable to meet the
timeline for presenting an offer to the Company that it had earlier communicated and requested a meeting with Mr.
Remington in San Francisco, California in early January 2020, which was subsequently scheduled for January 10,
2020. Mr. Yasuno did not explain the reason for the delay.
On December 28, 2019, Mr. Remington sent an update regarding the strategic alternatives process to the Special
Committee in which he noted that as of such date the Company had 11 active inbound parties, including Party A,
Party B, Party C and Parent, and that the Company was in the process of negotiating non-disclosure agreements with
eight of those 11 parties. Mr. Remington noted that two investment banks were also inbound parties acting as
financial intermediaries, with undisclosed clients. Mr. Remington also noted for the Special Committee that there were
21 additional potential parties to be contacted by Centerview.
On January 6, 2020, the Special Committee held a meeting at Perkins Coie’s offices in Palo Alto, California, which was
also attended by representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie. During the meeting, Centerview provided an update
on the strategic alternatives process. The Special Committee also discussed whether to continue the process with
inbound parties or to expand to a broader sale process.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 10, 2020, Mr. Remington, Mr. Williford, Mr. Ogawa, and representatives of Centerview met with Mr.
Yasuno and Mr. Oka and representatives of Parent’s financial advisor at Perkins Coie’s San Francisco, California
offices. In the meeting, Mr. Yasuno explained that at that time Parent could not participate in a strategic process, but
could not go into more detail or disclose for how long Parent would be restricted from participating in such a process.
However, Mr. Yasuno communicated to Mr. Remington, Mr. Williford and Mr. Ogawa that Parent remained highly
interested in purchasing the Company.
On January 13, 2020, at the direction of the Special Committee, Centerview began reaching out to potential buyers of
the Company and, in connection therewith, Centerview also distributed process letters to such buyers inviting them
to submit non-binding proposals for a potential acquisition of the Company. Centerview communicated to potential
buyers that non-binding indications of interest would be due on February 12, 2020.
From January 14, 2020 through March 10, 2020, Centerview held discussions with 39 Special Committee-approved
parties about their respective interest in pursuing a potential transaction with the Company. Most of these parties
communicated a lack of interest or ability to participate in a potential transaction for reasons such as the pandemic-
depressed market. Of the parties contacted, 19 indicated an interest in receiving additional information on the
Company’s operations as a basis for evaluation and subject to executing confidentiality agreements, were provided
such information related to the Company through meetings with representatives of Company or the Company’s
virtual data room, as well as draft merger agreements. Thereafter, following the negotiation and execution of non-
disclosure agreements with 20 parties, 17 parties participated in discussions with the Company’s management as well
as certain members of the Special Committee to further evaluate a potential transaction and 4 parties submitted
preliminary indications of interest.
On January 15, 2020, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington to, among other things, recommunicate Parent’s interest in
making an offer for the Company, but noted that Parent would still be unable to do so on the requested timeline. Mr.
Yasuno indicated that he would consult with Parent’s advisors and discuss internally about the idea of sharing
information only between legal advisors at this point and whether Parent could engage in a due diligence process
based on the executed non-disclosure agreement in order to request non-public information, so that Parent could be
prepared to move ahead quickly with a compelling offer when the time came.
From January 24, 2020 through March 2, 2020, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Page as well as certain members of the Special
Committee participated in management meetings with representatives of the 17 interested parties, including
representatives of Party A, Party B, Party C, a potential financial sponsor buyer (“Party D”) and Parent.
On February 10, 2020, Mr. Yasuno replied to a February 8, 2020 email from Mr. Remington asking if there had been a
change in status and stated that Parent had received the process letter from Centerview and Parent would still be
unable to submit a proposal on the requested timeline, but that Parent remained enthusiastic about the potential
transaction and hoped to be able to submit a proposal once its previously noted, but not described, issue was
resolved. Mr. Yasuno also requested to stay in touch with Mr. Remington and to hold a meeting in mid-March 2020 to
discuss a potential offer should the opportunity still exist.
On February 12, 2020, Parent delivered a letter in response to the process letter in which it stated that it remained
interested, but that it could not engage until the summer of 2020.
In February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began its impact on global markets and commerce, including the
Company’s operations. The spread of COVID-19 throughout the world and the strong actions taken by many
countries to reduce exposures led to a sharp decrease in global economic activity during the beginning of the second
quarter of 2020, which, at the time, the Company expected to continue during 2020. While the COVID-19 pandemic
and the related global economic effects had not materially impacted the Company’s business, operations, or financial
results to date, the Company expected at the time that, among other things, the global economic impact would result
in a decline in overall incremental demand for the Company’s services over the remainder of the year and would
elevate the risk of delayed payment or default by the Company’s customers. Along those lines, the Company
modeled a number of downside stress scenarios and their impact on liquidity. Furthermore, worldwide financial
markets experienced periods of extraordinary disruption and volatility, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19
pandemic and ultimately impacted the number of active bidders. At such time, the Company publicly disclosed that
the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak would impact the Company’s business and operations would depend on
future developments that were highly uncertain and could not be predicted.
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
From March 2020 through mid-June 2020, the Special Committee and the Board each met numerous times to discuss,
among other things, the Company’s financial position due to the COVID-19 pandemic, whether the strategic
alternatives process should be paused due to COVID-19, extending the bid period and the consequences of making a
potential executive leadership change at this stage of the strategic alternatives process.
On March 1, 2020, Mr. Yasuno emailed representatives of Centerview to follow up on the letter Parent submitted on
February 12, 2020 in response to the process letter in order to reaffirm that Parent continued to be enthusiastic about
a potential transaction and that Parent would contact Centerview again in mid-March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa had a telephonic meeting with representatives of Party B, who
stated that it was withdrawing from the process due to the time it was taking Party B to integrate a previous
acquisition. The withdrawal was confirmed in a letter from Party B, dated March 10, 2020.
Also, on March 5, 2020, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and
full year of 2019. The Company’s common stock closed trading at $22.76 per share on the NYSE.
On March 12, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a representative of
Perkins Coie. Mr. Remington provided an update on the strategic alternatives process, including updated bids. At
this time, he summarized the non-binding offers as (i) Party A: 0.80 shares of Party A stock for each share of the
Company’s common stock, which was equivalent to a price of approximately $21.86 per share of the Company’s
common stock; (ii) Party C: $24 to $27 per share, in cash; (iii) another potential financial sponsor buyer: $23 to $26 per
share, in cash; (iv) another potential financial sponsor buyer: $23.25 per share, in cash, for just the Company’s
container business, but not the logistics or rail business; (v) a potential strategic buyer declined to make an offer
given market conditions and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and (vi) Party D
declined to make an offer at this time based on their view of market conditions and uncertainty over global pandemic
driven economic growth, but indicated potential interest when the market stabilized in the future and acknowledged a
potential value of the Company in the $30 per share range. In addition, the Special Committee discussed the
Company’s valuation and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on global markets, including on the market price per
share of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s common stock closed trading at $15.24 per share on the
NYSE.
On March 16, 2020, the Special Committee and a representative of Perkins Coie held a telephonic meeting. The initial
portion of the meeting also included a briefing from Mr. Garcia and Mr. Page, who had been invited to brief the
Special Committee on the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic was having on the Company. After their presentation,
Mr. Garcia and Mr. Page left the meeting and the Special Committee discussed Centerview’s analysis of the bids and
whether to continue the exploration of strategic alternatives process or to halt the process due to the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 18, 2020, the Special Committee held a meeting by teleconference, which was also attended by a
representative of Perkins Coie, to discuss, among other things, the outstanding bids and the Company’s liquidity
overall, including the financial impacts and process in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 25, 2020, Mr. Remington had a telephonic meeting with representatives of Parent, which was also attended
by representatives of Centerview, during which the representatives of Parent reiterated Parent’s interest in a potential
transaction, but that Parent could not engage before the summer due to what Parent later disclosed in September 2020
regarding its own business integration.
On March 26, 2020, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa had a telephone call with the chief executive officer and the lead
independent director of Party A to discuss Party A’s continued interest in acquiring the Company. Party A’s chief
executive officer cited the strategic benefits that Party A saw in combing the two companies, and then discussed
Party A’s concerns with both the Company’s rail and logistics business, to which he attributed only a small positive
value. The representatives of Party A then noted that Party A was considering changing its offer from a combination
of cash and stock to only stock due to the then-current market volatility.
Also, on March 26, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a
representative of Perkins Coie, to discuss, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business
and discussions with the Company’s lenders related thereto, concerns the Special Committee had with the current
leadership structure of the Company and the possible effects of changing leadership in the middle of the strategic
alternatives process. With respect to the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business and discussions with the
Company’s lenders related thereto, Mr. Page described his discussions with the Company’s lenders, who reaffirmed
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
their support of the Company and the shipping industry in general, who also noted that the shipping industry (which
includes container leasing companies) was very important to the world economy. With respect to a potential
leadership change, the Special Committee concluded that any change to leadership should occur only after the
strategic alternatives process was terminated. In addition, the Special Committee discussed whether to continue the
strategic alternatives process and the potential for stockholder activist actions if the strategic alternatives process
was terminated given the uncertainty created by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Remington also described
Centerview’s recommendation to continue the process with parties that had the wherewithal to consummate a
potential transaction in light of the then-current macroeconomic backdrop given the uncertainty of COVID-19’s
potential impact on the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. After discussion, the Special Committee
decided to continue the strategic alternatives process. The Special Committee further discussed the various bids
received to date and the Special Committee discussed how it could most effectively negotiate with third-party
bidders.
On March 30, 2020, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa had a telephonic meeting with representatives of Party D,
representatives of Party D’s financial advisor and representatives of Centerview to discuss the market volatility being
driven by COVID-19. The representatives of Party D presented their thinking about the then-current market
conditions, along with what they saw as a continued deterioration in multiple indicators, including that one-third of
the world was in quarantine, and speculated that container demand would be a lagging indicator. The representatives
of Party D also noted that they were concerned that container shipping lines would also come under stress and pass
on that stress to container leasing companies.
During April 2020 and May 2020, representatives of Party A, Party C and Party D conducted due diligence on the
Company and the Company conducted reverse due diligence on Party A.
On April 14, 2020, representatives of Centerview provided the Special Committee with a relationship disclosure
memorandum.
On May 5, 2020, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2020. The
Company’s common stock closed trading at $15.48 per share on the NYSE.
On May 20, 2020, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by Mr. Page and a
representative of Perkins Coie. The initial portion of the Board meeting pertained to operational issues, including
approval of new pricing guidelines for leases. After the operational discussion, Mr. Garcia left the meeting. Mr.
Remington then provided the remaining Board members (i.e., the members of the Special Committee) and Mr. Page
with an update regarding the strategic alternatives process. Mr. Remington informed the remaining members of the
Board that Party D had decided not to move forward with an offer because of a number of factors, including: (i)
concern about a weak market for container leasing in 2020; (ii) concern about a “change of control” default under
certain of the Company’s then-outstanding financing documents; and (iii) a belief that the Board would require a
price that approximated book value, and that book value was too great a premium over the then-current market price.
Mr. Remington then told the remaining Board members that he had advised Centerview that it should contact Party A
and advise Party A that it would need to increase its preliminary offer if it expected to have its impending offer
accepted by the Board.
On June 1, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of
Party C, and representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie, during which representatives from Party C presented on
the background of the potential offer they would be submitting to the Special Committee. The Company’s common
stock closed trading at $18.58 per share on the NYSE.
On June 2, 2020, Party C submitted a non-binding offer to purchase the Company at $24 per share, in cash. The
Company’s common stock closed trading at $19.44 per share on the NYSE. Party C had communicated that its
proposal included negative value being ascribed to both rail and logistics. Therefore, Party C was asked to provide a
container only proposal. Subsequently, representatives of Centerview held calls with representatives of Party C.
During these conversations, Party C verbally revised its non-binding offer to $27 per share, in cash, excluding the rail
and logistics businesses.
On June 2, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of the
Company’s management and representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie, during which the Special Committee
discussed Party C’s revised offer and the impact of disposing of the rail and logistics businesses separately on
overall bid prices for the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 5, 2020, Party A submitted a revised written offer to purchase the Company via a stock for stock acquisition
with an exchange ratio of 0.76 of Party A’s shares for each share of the Company’s common stock consisting of 10%
cash and 90% stock and no stock buyback, which was equivalent to a price of approximately $24.53 per share of the
Company’s common stock. Party A indicated that the decrease to the valuation was a result of the significant tax
restructuring costs and a lower valuation of the rail and logistics businesses. The Company’s common stock closed
trading at $21.87 per share on the NYSE. Following the submission of Party A’s revised written offer, representatives
of Centerview held calls with representatives of Party A. During these conversations, it was verbally communicated
that Party A would increase its bid to an exchange ratio of 0.80, with 10% cash and 90% stock and no stock buyback
to make its proposal more competitive, subject to the completion of due diligence and further analysis of certain
issues.
On June 6, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a representative of
Perkins Coie. The Special Committee discussed Party A’s comments to the auction merger agreement and Party A’s
offer that was submitted on June 5, 2020, and other issues in connection with the strategic alternatives process,
including the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the strategic alternatives process.
On June 7, 2020, Party A submitted a revised written offer to purchase the Company at an exchange ratio of 0.80 with
10% cash and 90% stock and no buy back, which was equivalent to a price of approximately $25.82 per share of the
Company’s common stock. Party A also clarified how it was valuing the rail and logistics businesses. Party A
indicated that it was valuing the two businesses at approximately a $25 million discount (i) to current book value, with
respect to the rail business, and (ii) based on total book value (less any related shutdown or sale costs, and not
including any goodwill and intangible assets related to logistics acquisitions), with respect to the logistics business.
On June 5, 2020, the last business day prior to June 7, 2020, the Company’s common stock closed trading at $21.87
per share on the NYSE.
On June 8, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of
Centerview and Perkins Coie, during which the Special Committee discussed Party A’s updated offer. In addition, the
Special Committee discussed the other bids independently and in relation to Party A’s offer.
On June 10, 2020, Party C revised its bid in writing in the form of a price bridge, dependent on the amount of losses it
would incur in disposing of the rail and logistics businesses, with a range of $24.50 per share to $28.00 per share, in
cash, or $27.20 per share, in cash, if the transaction involved the sale of rail business and the shutdown of the
logistics business. The Company’s common stock closed trading at $16.38 per share on the NYSE.
Also, on June 10, 2020, representatives of Centerview had a telephone call with Party A’s financial advisor, who
verbally provided a further updated final bid, wherein the exchange ratio had been increased to 0.85. The updated bid
was the same as the previous bid in all other respects.
On June 11, 2020, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of
Company management and representatives of Potter Anderson and Perkins Coie, during which the Special Committee
discussed, among other things, the revised bids from Party A and Party C. Potter Anderson provided the Special
Committee a review of the Special Committee’s fiduciary duties in reviewing the bids and reaching a decision. The
Special Committee also discussed whether long-term value was being reduced by the depressed nature of the near-
term valuation. Ultimately, the Special Committee decided to reject both bids and to terminate the strategic
alternatives process because the Special Committee deemed the bids inadequate from a financial point of view. The
Special Committee believed it was unrealistic to think that any bidder would offer fair value in a pandemic-depressed
market, especially considering two of the bidders cited the pandemic-depressed market as their reason for not
bidding.
On June 12, 2020, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Company
management (excluding Mr. Garcia) and a representative of Perkins Coie. The Board ratified the Special Committee’s
decision to reject bids and to terminate both the strategic alternatives process and Centerview’s engagement. In
addition, the Board decided to terminate Mr. Garcia and nominated Mr. Page as the Company’s interim President and
Chief Executive Officer, and also appointed Mr. Page to serve as a member of the Board, which appointment became
effective on June 14, 2020. The Company’s common stock closed trading at $19.37 per share on the NYSE.
On June 15, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing the termination of the strategic alternatives review
process, initiation of regular cash dividends on its common stock at the rate of $0.25 per share per quarter and the
change in leadership, whereby Mr. Page, the Company’s then Chief Financial Officer, was appointed
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Executive Vice President and Interim President and Chief Executive Officer to succeed Mr. Garcia, and Mr. Page’s
appointment to the Board. The Company noted in the press release that, as a result of the strategic alternatives
process, the Company and the Board believed that the Company could best maximize stockholder value by focusing
on its profitable core container business and that current market conditions were not conducive to a transaction
beneficial to stockholders. The press release also noted that the Company and the Board were committed to exiting
the rail and logistics businesses. The Company’s common stock closed trading at $18.34 per share on the NYSE.
Prior to the termination of the strategic alternatives process, interest was solicited from 39 potential bidders, which
included 31 financial sponsors and 8 strategic buyers. Of these, there were management meetings with 17 interested
parties, with about half of each type of group receiving a management presentation. In addition, there were four
indications of interest received as first round bids. However, two potential bidders withdrew their indications of
interest and cited their view of COVID-19-driven unstable market conditions.
On June 16, 2020, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa, in which he stated that Parent would like to
keep an open channel of communication with the Company with respect to a potential acquisition of the Company in
the future.
Between July 1, 2020 and October 7, 2020, Mr. Page, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa had various telephonic meetings with
representatives of Parent, including Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka, to discuss, among other things, the Board’s willingness
to listen to incoming inquiries, the lessons the Company learned from the strategic process that had just been
completed, preferred timing for any potential offer to purchase the Company such that the Board could attempt to
ensure that stockholders of the Company would receive maximum value. With respect to the timing for any potential
offer, Mr. Remington suggested during such calls that a more beneficial time for the Company to entertain an offer,
and for Parent to be presenting one, would be towards the end of 2021 after the Company had disposed of rail, had
continued to demonstrate good financial performance, and when the market for transportation stocks would in theory
no longer be depressed.
On August 6, 2020, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter of 2020
and that the Board had declared the Company’s first quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. The
Company’s common stock closed trading at $18.40 per share on the NYSE.
On August 14, 2020, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its logistics business to
NFI, a North American logistics provider, for cash proceeds of $6.2 million. The Company’s common stock closed
trading at $21.96 per share on the NYSE.
On August 17, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing the sale of the logistics business. The
Company’s common stock closed trading at $21.96 per share on the NYSE.
On August 20, 2020, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by a representative of Company
management and a representative of Perkins Coie, during which the Board discussed the recent discussions with
stockholders and Parent.
On September 3, 2020, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Company
management and Perkins Coie, during which Mr. Remington provided an update on Parent’s indication of interest.
On September 21, 2020, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Company
management and Perkins Coie, during which the Board discussed, among other things, Parent’s continued indication
of interest.
On September 28, 2020, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington to, among other things, reiterate that Parent was still
enthusiastic about acquiring the Company and to schedule a time to discuss further in several weeks. Mr. Yasuno
added that Parent had just announced the conclusion of agreement on business integration with Hitachi Capital
Corporation that was planned to become effective on April 1, 2021.
On October 29, 2020, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the third quarter of 2020
and that the Board had declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. The Company’s common stock closed
trading at $26.74 per share on the NYSE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 30, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing the agreement to sell its remaining railcar
fleet to affiliates of Infinity Transportation for cash proceeds of $228.1 million. The Company’s common stock closed
trading at $31.65 per share on the NYSE.
Also, on November 30, 2020, representatives of Centerview received an unsolicited email from Party B’s financial
advisor, inquiring as to whether the Company would be interested in resuming the strategic alternatives process in
light of the announcement of the sale of the rail business.
On December 1, 2020, Mr. Remington and Mr. Page had a call with representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie to
discuss Party B’s renewed interest.
On December 3, 2020, Centerview received an unsolicited call from Party A’s financial advisor, during which Party A’s
financial advisor communicated, among other things, that Party A had continued interest in a combination of Party A
and the Company.
On December 4, 2020, Mr. Remington and Mr. Page had a call with representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie to
discuss Party A’s renewed interest and to reply that the Board was committed to fulfilling its fiduciary duties and
would entertain any offers.
On December 8, 2020, Mr. Remington had a videoconference with the chairman of the board of directors of a potential
strategic buyer (“Party E”), who expressed an interest in purchasing the Company.
On December 9, 2020, Mr. Page, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa had a telephone call with Mr. Yasuno, Mr. Oka and
another representative of Parent at Parent’s suggestion. During the call, the representatives of Parent congratulated
Mr. Page, Mr. Remington and Mr. Ogawa on the sale of the rail business, but mentioned that Parent was still not in a
position to engage in discussions regarding a potential transaction until March or April 2021.
On December 10, 2020, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives of
Company management and Perkins Coie, during which the Board discussed, among other things, the recent
unsolicited strategic inquiries that it had received from Party A and Party E. The Board decided to explore the
inquiries, but to refrain from discussions until after February 2021, when the Company’s fourth quarter of 2020 and
full year 2020 earnings had been released, in part because the Board expected the results to be favorable to the
Company. The Board believe that during that time it could coordinate with Centerview regarding populating a data
room with due diligence materials. The Board also believed that delaying its response to Party A and Party E might
also benefit stockholders by giving Parent an opportunity to participate in the process.
On December 11, 2020, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa, Mr. Page, and representatives of Centerview and Perkins Coie held
a videoconference to obtain Centerview’s advice regarding the questions raised in the Board meeting the prior day
pertaining to how to best respond to incoming strategic inquiries. The parties discussed the feasibility of a short and
targeted strategic alternatives process as well as the optimal timing to initiate the process.
On December 15, 2020, Mr. Remington and Mr. Page had a videoconference with the chair of the board of directors of
Party E in response to Party E’s inbound indication of interest. The representatives of the Company communicated
that while the Company appreciated Party E’s inquiry as to whether the Company was receptive to Party E’s offer, at
the current time the Company preferred to respond definitively after the Company reported earnings in February 2021.
A similar message was conveyed by a representative of Centerview to Party A’s financial advisor.
On December 29, 2020, the Company completed the sale its remaining railcar fleet to affiliates of Infinity
Transportation for cash proceeds of $228.1 million and issued a press release announcing the same. The Company’s
common stock closed trading at $31.18 per share on the NYSE.
On February 14, 2021, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington to inform him that Parent had been conducting preparatory
work to enable Parent to start official discussions with the Company regarding the acquisition of the Company as
soon as it became possible, which would be no sooner than after the completion of the aforementioned business
integration.
On February 16, 2021, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full
year of 2020 and that the Board had declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share and approved an expansion
of the Company’s share repurchase program. The Company’s common stock closed trading at $37.95 per share on the
NYSE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 17, 2021, the Board authorized a limited re-opening of the strategic alternatives process. In determining
whether to re-engage in a strategic alternatives process, several Board members expressed a belief that the process
should be efficient. They were concerned that a repeat of the long process from 2020 would damage the Company by
both hurting employee morale and giving the Company the stigma of being “in play.” To mitigate the aforementioned
potential risks, the Board designed a one-month process, whereby bidders would be required to engage in an intense
discovery period, provide detailed comments on the Merger Agreement and make a “last and final” bid. The Board
also authorized the re-engagement of Centerview, pursuant to an engagement letter that was subsequently executed
on March 1, 2021. In addition, the Board approved a response to each of Party A, Party E and Parent, and also an
outreach to five additional potentially interested parties recommended by Centerview and agreed to by the Board.
Accordingly, the number of additional parties contacted was limited to those who would be most likely to participate
and had the ability to do so based on the strategic alternatives process completed in June 2020. Furthermore, given
that the Company had just concluded a very fulsome process with public disclosure less than 12 months prior, the
Board was of the view that it had sufficient information with which to make such a selection. The Company’s common
stock closed trading at $41.47 per share on the NYSE.
On February 22, 2021, by an action of unanimous written consent of the Board, the Board determined that Centerview
should be retained as the Company’s financial advisor with respect to the re-opening of the strategic alternatives
process.
On February 24, 2021, the Board held an update call via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives
of Centerview and Perkins Coie. The purpose of the call was for representatives of Centerview to brief the Board on
incoming inquiries from prospective bidders, as well as Centerview’s thoughts on running a targeted process that
would determine if the much improved economy and the Company’s self-help program, which generally consisted of
selling the rail and logistics business, implementing a regular dividend and resuming stock buybacks, would lead to a
better valuation from prospective bidders and more attractive bids that would be in the best interest of the
Company’s stockholders to accept.
From February 25, 2021 through April 30, 2021, Centerview held discussions with the parties approved by the Board
at the February 17, 2021 meeting. Most of the parties concluded that they were not interested in evaluating a
potential transaction given the then current valuation of the public company lessors. During this time,
representatives of the Company’s management held calls with representatives of Parent, Party A and Party E
regarding due diligence matters, which were also attended by representatives of Perkins Coie and Centerview, and
representatives of such parties’ respective financial and legal advisors. Party A, Party E, and Parent continued to
express an interest in evaluating a potential transaction, ultimately providing indications of interest on April 30, 2021.
On March 1, 2021, pursuant to the resolutions adopted on February 17, 2021, the Company entered into a new
engagement letter with Centerview, dated as of February 20, 2021, in order to re-engage Centerview as the Company’s
financial advisor.
On March 2, 2021, Mr. Remington and Mr. Page had a videoconference with Party E’s chief executive officer to inform
Party E that the Company had decided to initiate a new strategic alternatives process. A short discussion ensued
about aspects of the process.
Also, on March 2, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives
of Centerview and representatives of Perkins Coie. Among other topics, representatives of Centerview advised the
Board on: (i) a conversation between representatives of Centerview and Party A’s financial advisor, at which a
representative of Party A’s financial advisor conveyed Party A’s continued strong interest in purchasing the
Company; (ii) a summary of “pros and cons” in re-opening a discussion regarding a possible strategic transaction
with Party A, which included, among other things, the synergies of the combined companies, possible leakage of
information to a competitor. The representatives of Centerview also discussed the material terms that a process letter
would contain, and the number of companies that would be solicited in a targeted outreach. The process letter would
provide, among other things, that offers would be “best and final” and the auction merger agreement would contain
an explicit “go shop” right, with a “break fee”, permitting solicitation of other bids after a merger agreement was
executed. Thereafter, the members of the Board expressed substantial support on proceeding with a targeted process
with a one-month period for bidders to respond.
On March 7, 2021, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa and Mr. Page had a videoconference with Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka of
Parent. Mr. Remington said that, given the long-expressed interest of Parent in acquiring the Company, along with
Parent’s apparent inability to act currently on that interest as Parent had previously told the Company that
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Parent could not actively engage in a process and conduct due diligence until April 1, 2021, as a matter of courtesy
and in case Parent might be able to accelerate its ability to act on its interest, representatives of the Company wanted
to inform Parent of the then-current unsolicited interest of third parties to purchase the Company. Mr. Remington
further noted that (i) two unsolicited parties had expressed an interest in purchasing the Company, (ii) the Board had
responded by initiating a new strategic process, and (iii) in order to have a sufficiently competitive process, the
Company directed Centerview to reach out to a small group of previously interested parties to participate in the
process. Mr. Remington then noted that the purpose of the call was to see if Parent was interested in participating in
the process based on the following terms: one month of due diligence, starting with access to a data room and ending
with bid; one bidding round, with a best and final bid; and a commencement of the process as soon as the following
week and possibility as late as starting April 1, 2020. The representatives of Parent stated that they were not sure if
they could meet the outlined timeframe and would get back to the Company about Parent’s ability to participate in the
process.
On March 8, 2021, Mr. Remington, Mr. Page attended a videoconference with a representative of Centerview and a
representative of Perkins Coie, during which the representative of Perkins Coie provided Mr. Remington and Mr. Page
with an overview of the Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale of the Company and
representatives of Centerview presented their recommendations regarding the structure of a potential targeted
strategic alternatives process.
On March 11, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives of
Centerview and Perkins Coie. The purpose of the meeting was to decide on whether to proceed with a targeted
strategic alternatives process and to provide the full Board with access to the advice from the Company’s financial
advisor and primary outside counsel that had been provided to Mr. Remington and Mr. Page during in the call held
on March 8, 2021. A representative of Perkins Coie discussed the legal framework under which the Board should
consider the potential process, including an overview of the prior strategic alternatives process in 2020 and another
overview of its fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale of the Company. Following Perkins Coie’s
presentation, the representatives of Centerview and the Board discussed Centerview’s recommendations regarding
the structure of a targeted strategic alternatives process and Centerview’s advice that, in light of the extensive
strategic alternatives process in 2019 through 2020, a more targeted strategic process could be effectively run. The
representatives of Centerview recommended contacting eight parties, including three potential strategic buyers,
including Parent, and five potential financial sponsor buyers that appeared financially qualified and known to be
interested in infrastructure investments (collectively, the “2021 Outreach Parties”). Furthermore, it was noted that the
2021 Outreach Parties were selected because of their industry knowledge, their prior expressed interest in the
Company, and their perceived “ability to do a deal.” In addition, Board members expressed their support of an
efficient process of roughly four to five weeks and believed that it was an opportune time from the perspective of
stockholders to sell, and that it had taken all reasonable steps to select the bidders best positioned to complete a
transaction in a timely manner and at a favorable price. Further, the Board decided to extend the timeframe for the
targeted strategic alternatives process for all potentially interested parties until the end of April 2021. The Board
concluded that, based on the in-depth review of the proposed design of the targeted strategic alternatives process
that it had engaged in over time, including meetings with representatives of Centerview formally (in Board meetings)
and informally (in Board updates) on February 12, 2021, February 24, 2021, March 2, 2021 and March 11, 2021 and the
advice of representatives of Centerview, as well as the experience of Board members, that a targeted strategic
alternatives process could be conducted with a limited number of potential bidders in a manner designed to be in the
best interest of the Company’s stockholders. The Board then unanimously approved proceeding with a targeted
strategic alternatives process, consistent with Centerview’s recommendations.
On March 12, 2021, Mr. Yasuno emailed Mr. Remington to let him know that Parent would be able to engage in the
strategic alternatives process, as outlined by the Company, on April 1, 2021.
On March 14, 2021, Mr. Remington emailed Mr. Yasuno to inform him that the Board had decided to set April 30, 2021
as the bid date for Parent and other bidders to provide Parent with a draft of an amendment to the non-disclosure
agreement that the parties had entered into on January 6, 2020, which included a standstill provision.
Between March 14, 2021 and March 22, 2021, representatives of Centerview distributed process letters to
representatives of the 2021 Outreach Parties.
On March 15, 2021, Mr. Remington attended a videoconference with representatives of Centerview and
representatives of Perkins Coie to discuss acceptable joint venture bidding partners for Party E.
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On April 21, 2021, Mr. Remington attended a videoconference with the chairman of the board of directors of Party E,
at his request, to discuss prospective aspects of Party E’s bid.
Also, on April 21, 2021, Mr. Remington had a call with Mr. Page, representatives of Centerview and representatives of
Perkins Coie to report on the videoconference with the chairman of the board of directors of Party E.
On April 27, 2021, at the request of Parent, a conference call was held among representatives of Parent’s financial
advisor, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, Parent’s outside U.S. counsel (“Davis Polk”), Centerview and Perkins Coie.
During the call, Davis Polk and Parent’s financial advisor explained that, due to a Japanese tax issue, if Parent was to
bid for the Company, the Migrating Subsidiaries, the Company’s primary offshore subsidiaries, would need to first
“migrate” to the United States. The parties then discussed an analysis of how the proposed Migration would be
effected.
Also, on April 27, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Perkins
Coie. Among other things, the Board discussed the status of the targeted strategic alternatives process, including
the timing for receipt of bids, and tentatively reserved time on the mornings of May 4, 2021 for a Board meeting to
review and make preliminary decisions about bids, and a further Board meeting on May 6, 2021 to make final
decisions, both meetings to be attended by the Company’s outside legal and financial advisors.
On April 28, 2021, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa and Mr. Page had a video call with Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka, at the
request of Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka. Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka wanted to know whether the Migration, as a condition
of Parent’s bid, would be acceptable to the Company. The Company’s representatives said that the Company was
open to the Migration, understood the rationale from a Japanese tax perspective, and preliminarily did not think the
Migration would be problematic.
On April 29, 2021, the Company issued a press release reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2021 and
that the Board had declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. The Company’s common stock closed
trading at $43.54 per share on the NYSE.
On April 30, 2021, the Board (other than Mr. Remington), representatives of Perkins Coie and representatives of
Centerview attended a reverse due diligence call with representatives of Party A.
Also, on April 30, 2021, following entry into non-disclosure agreements or amended non-disclosure agreements with
the parties, as applicable, the Board received three proposals: (i) a bid from Party A for a stock for stock merger at an
exchange ratio of 0.85 per share of the Company’s common stock, which was equivalent to a price of $42.64 per share
of the Company’s common stock; (ii) a bid from Party E to acquire the Company for $48.55 per share, in cash; (iii) a
bid from Parent to acquire the Company for $56.00 per share of common stock, in cash, as well as a mark-up of the
draft Merger Agreement. The Company’s common stock closed trading at $42.55 per share on the NYSE.
On May 4, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by representatives of Centerview and
representatives of Perkins Coie, to further review and discuss the bids received on April 30, 2021, as well as review
key issues related to Parent’s proposal, including a discussion led by representative of Perkins Coie regarding
Parent’s mark-up of the auction merger agreement and the general terms of the agreement. At the meeting, the Board
formed a new special committee (the “Second Special Committee”), comprised of Mr. Remington and Mr. Page, which
was tasked with engaging in discussions and negotiations regarding a definitive agreement should the Board
determine to move forward with one of the potential bidders, though authority to ultimately approve any transaction
remained with the Board.
On May 7, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by representatives of
Centerview and representatives of Perkins Coie, to further discuss the bids received on April 30, 2021 and whether to
negotiate with bidders. At the meeting, the Board determined to move forward with Parent because of the per share
offer price, the overall strength of the offer, the seriousness of the bid considering the amount of work that had been
done to put together the proposal and mark up the draft Merger Agreement, and the overall likelihood of closing. The
Board also discussed aspects of the Migration and the absence of a “go shop” provision, noting that the Company
could still entertain unsolicited offers.
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On May 10, 2021, the Second Special Committee met with representatives of Centerview and representatives of
Perkins Coie via videoconference to discuss an issues list related to Parent’s mark-up of the draft Merger Agreement.
Key issues discussed included the price, the “fiduciary out provisions,” the Migration, Parent’s right to terminate the
Merger Agreement and the Termination Fee.
From May 10, 2021 to June 15, 2021 representatives of Centerview held numerous discussions with the financial
advisor of Parent. Those discussions focused on the structural, and financial considerations pertaining to the
Migration as well as the economics of a potential transaction. Representatives of Centerview communicated to the
financial advisor of Parent that the offer price needed to improve from the original proposal of $56.00 per share, for
the Board to have the ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in the event of a Superior Proposal and an
unconditional obligation on the part of Parent to close the Merger subsequent to the completion of the Migration. In
subsequent discussions it was communicated that Parent would not increase its proposal of $56.00 per share, but
would accommodate the Company paying its normal course dividends through the end of 2021.
On May 12, 2021, representatives of Perkins Coie provided representatives of Davis Polk with a revised draft of the
Merger Agreement.
On May 14, 2021, representatives of Centerview provided the Special Committee with an updated relationship
disclosure memorandum.
On May 20, 2021, Mr. Page, Mr. Yasuno and Mr. Oka met via videoconference, during which the representatives of
Parent explained it was very important to Parent to retain the Company’s management team post-Closing. As a result,
the representatives of Parent indicated Parent was prepared to provide employment contracts and retention packages
to Mr. Page and certain other individuals, the key terms of which were to be summarized in what became the Term
Sheets.
Between May 20, 2021 and June 6, 2021, Mr. Page and certain other individuals, Parent and Davis Polk negotiated the
Term Sheets.
On May 21, 2021, representatives of Davis Polk provided representatives of Perkins Coie with a further revised draft
of the draft Merger Agreement.
On May 26, 2021, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa and Mr. Page attended a videoconference with Mr. Yasuno, Mr. Oka and
another representative of Parent to discuss, among other things, the status and progress of the negotiations with
respect to the open items in the draft Merger Agreement, including, among other things, with respect to the payment
of regular common stock dividends and the Migration.
On May 28, 2021, representatives of Perkins Coie met with representatives of Davis Polk via videoconference to
negotiate open items in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to the “fiduciary out provisions,” including
a “force the vote” provision (the removal of which the Board subsequently negotiated), the Migration, the amount of
the Termination Fee and circumstances under which such fee would be payable, the request for a Parent Termination
Fee and circumstances under which such fee would be payable, the conditions applicable to initiating the Migration
and completing the Merger, and the payment of regular common stock dividends.
On May 31, 2021, Mr. Remington, Mr. Ogawa and Mr. Page attended a videoconference with Mr. Yasuno, Mr. Oka and
other representatives of Parent, to discuss, among other things, the status and progress of the negotiations with
respect to the open items in the draft Merger Agreement, including, among other things, with respect to the payment
of regular common stock dividend, the “fiduciary out” provisions in the draft Merger Agreement, a request for the
Parent Termination Fee and interim operating covenants.
On June 2, 2021, Parent delivered a “package” proposal to Centerview that addressed a number of issues that were
still open between the parties. Parent proposed accepting a number of the Company’s positions, while maintaining its
positions on a number of items. The “package” introduced the right to terminate the Merger Agreement in the event
that the Closing had not occurred within a specified timeframe following initiation of the Migration.
Between June 6, 2021 and June 10, 2021, representatives of Perkins Coie and representatives of Davis Polk negotiated
open provisions of the draft Merger Agreement and representatives of Parent and their legal advisors continued their
due diligence review of the Company. Key issues that were negotiated included, among other things, the transaction
risks associated with the Migration and, in particular, the risk associated with completing the Migration in a situation
in which the Merger did not subsequently close, mutually acceptable “fiduciary out”

provisions, termination rights and the payment of a corresponding Company Termination Fee and Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, expense reimbursement, regulatory filings, management team employment contracts, operating and
other covenants, transaction litigation rights, maintenance of the current debt structure, and required consents.
Also, on June 10, 2021, representatives of the Company, Centerview, Perkins Coie, Parent, Parent’s financial advisor
and Davis Polk met via videoconference to discuss the signing of the transaction and announcement logistics,
assuming that the parties could reach agreement on the remaining open items in the Merger Agreement.
On June 13, 2021, Mr. Page emailed executed copies of the Term Sheets to a representative of Parent.
On June 15, 2021, representatives of Davis Polk met with representatives of Perkins Coie via videoconference to
negotiate open items in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to Company representations and
warranties, interim operating covenants and the Migration covenants, and the disclosure schedules. Later that day,
representatives of Davis Polk provided representatives of Perkins Coie with a revised draft of the draft Merger
Agreement.
On June 16, 2021, representatives of Perkins Coie provided representatives of Davis Polk with a revised draft of the
draft Merger Agreement. Representatives of Perkins Coie and representatives of Davis Polk corresponded several
times via teleconference to finalize the remaining open items in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to
the Company’s interim operating covenants.
On June 17, 2021, representatives of Davis Polk provided representatives of Perkins Coie with a proposed final draft
of the Merger Agreement. Subsequently, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, which was also attended by
representatives of Company management, representatives of Centerview and representatives of Perkins Coie.
Representatives of Centerview reviewed with the Board Centerview’s financial analysis of the Common Merger
Consideration, and rendered to the Board an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated such date, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken in preparing its opinion,
the Common Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than as
specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Perkins Coie then discussed the Board’s fiduciary duties and provided the Board with a summary of the key legal
terms of the draft Merger Agreement and led a discussion thereof. Following additional discussion and deliberation,
by a unanimous vote of the Board, the Board determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and recommended to the stockholders
of the Company to vote to approve the Merger Agreement. For a detailed discussion of Centerview’s opinion, please
see below under the caption “-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC”. The Company’s common stock closed trading at
$38.16 per share on the NYSE.
Later that day, the Company and Parent executed the Merger Agreement. Following the close of trading on the NYSE,
each of the Company and Parent issued a press release announcing the proposed Merger.

In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
the Board consulted with management, and representatives of the Company’s financial advisor and legal
54TABLE OF CONTENTS
advisors. In unanimously recommending that common stockholders vote in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Board
considered a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of
relative importance):
•
the Board’s understanding of the Company’s business, assets, financial condition, liquidity position and
results of operations, its competitive position and historical and prospective performance, and the nature of
the industry in which the Company competes.
•
the fact that the all-cash Merger Consideration will provide certainty of value and liquidity to stockholders,
while eliminating the effect of long-term business and execution risks to stockholders.
•
the relationship of the $56.00 per share Common Merger Consideration to the trading price of our common
stock on the NYSE, including that the Common Merger Consideration constituted a significant premium of
approximately (i) 47% over the closing share price of our common stock on the NYSE on June 17, 2021, the
last trading day prior to the date the Merger Agreement was publicly announced, and (ii) 31% over the
volume weighted average price of our common stock on the NYSE during the 60 trading days up to, and
including, June 17, 2021.
•
the relationship of the $56.00 per share Common Merger Consideration to the discounted cash flow net
present value of the Company.
•
the relationship of the $56.00 per share Common Merger Consideration to public comparable data of price
to book value.
•
the current and historical market prices of our common stock, including the market performance of our
common stock relative to those of other participants in our industry and the general market.
•
the evaluation of multiple strategic alternatives and the solicitation of bids from multiple strategic and
financial sponsor parties, as discussed under “-Background of the Merger.”
•
the Board’s belief that, if any third parties were interested in exploring a transaction with the Company,
such potential acquirers were contacted by Centerview or would have been motivated to approach the
Company.
•
the advantages of entering into the Merger Agreement in comparison with the risks of remaining an
independent public company, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties with respect to:
○
achieving the Company’s growth plans in light of the current and foreseeable market conditions,
including the risks and uncertainties in the U.S. and global economy generally and the Company’s
industry specifically, and risks related to the current stage of the economic cycle and macroeconomic
challenges that could result in a market downturn in the coming months or years, in each case,
especially in light of COVID-19;
○
competing with the Company’s competitors in a market with increasing container leasing industry
consolidation and container shipping company consolidation as well as the risk that potential
opportunities could diminish in the future as the Company’s competitors continue to pursue
acquisitions;
○
competing for lessees in a market with likely further container shipping company consolidation;
○
the increasing importance of operational scale and financial resources in maintaining efficiency and
remaining competitive in the container leasing industry;
○
achieving projected fiscal year 2021 performance and long-term financial projections as a standalone
company is unlikely to result in value to the Company’s stockholders that would exceed, on a present-
value basis, the value of the applicable Merger Consideration; and
○
the various additional risks and uncertainties that are set forth in Part I, Item 1A. of our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021, which is
incorporated by reference herein, as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC.

our ability to service, pay down or pay off our high debt levels while maintaining our operations and
funding current and future capital expenditures.

its belief, based on discussions and negotiations with Parent, that $56.00 per share was the highest price
Parent would be willing to pay.
•
the fact that the Company sought out and engaged other potential purchasers and the Board determined
that there were no other potential purchasers that would be reasonably likely to engage in a transaction in
the near term at a price per share equal to or greater than the price being offered by Parent and on other
acceptable terms.
•
the extensive arm’s length negotiations with Parent.
•
the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated, based on, among other things:

the Board’s evaluation of the conditions to the Merger;
○
that the condition to closing related to the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties,
is generally subject to a Company Material Adverse Effect qualification, as described under “The
Merger Agreement-Representations and Warranties;”
○
the absence of a financing condition;
○
Parent’s representation that it has and will have sufficient financial resources to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration and consummate the Merger;
○
the Board’s and management’s assessment, after discussion with representatives of Centerview, that
Parent has the financial capability to complete the Merger;
○
that the Company will be permitted to continue to pay quarterly dividends on its Preferred Stock and
on its common stock (not to exceed $0.30 per share of common stock per quarter), solely to the extent
made on payment dates that correspond to record dates on June 28, 2021, September 27, 2021, and
December 27, 2021, between signing and Closing under the Merger Agreement;
○
the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals;
○
the relative likelihood of completing the Migration, including the obtainment of the Migration Contract
Consents, within the required timeframe such that the Closing can take place prior to the End Date;
○
that the End Date under the Merger Agreement is expected to allow for sufficient time to complete the
Merger, obtain required regulatory approvals and complete the Migration;
○
the Company’s ability to elect tax treatment that will be neutral to it in the event the Migration is
completed, but the Merger is not completed; and
○
the remedies available under the Merger Agreement to the Company in the event of a breach by
Parent, including, but not limited to, our ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement, and to
enforce specifically the terms of the Merger Agreement, as described under “The Merger Agreement-
Specific Performance.”

the terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements, including, but not limited to:

Agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal upon payment of
the Termination Fee and the Merger Agreement Expenses, as described under “The Merger
Agreement-Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation; Intervening Events” and “The

of the outstanding shares of common stock to vote at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date, and the
stockholders would be free to reject the Merger.

shares, and beneficial owners of shares whose nominees follow the required statutory procedures, who
timely file a written objection to the Merger Agreement, do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal (to the
extent they are entitled to do so) and comply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law, which
provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to have a Delaware court determine the fair value
of their shares, which may be more than, less than, or the same as the amount such stockholders would
have received under the Merger Agreement.

the Board’s view that the Merger Agreement was the product of arm’s-length negotiations and contained
overall reasonable terms and conditions.

the Board might not have had another opportunity to do so.

the opinion of Centerview rendered to the Board on June 17, 2021, which was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated such date that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the
review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the Common Merger Consideration to be paid to
the holders of shares of common stock (other than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the
caption “-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC.”
The Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger that generally weighed against
entering into the Merger Agreement, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of
relative importance):
•
the fact that the announcement and pendency of the Merger, or the risks and costs to the Company if the
Merger does not close, could result in the diversion of management and employee attention (including
efforts and consequences relating to the Migration), and potentially have a negative effect on the
Company’s business and relationships with customers, suppliers and vendors.
•
the effect of a public announcement of the Company entering into the Merger Agreement on the
Company’s operations, stock price and employees and its ability to attract and retain key management and
personnel while the Merger is pending.
•
the fact that stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of the Company and will not
benefit from any appreciation in value of the Company, including any appreciation in value that could be
realized as a result of improvements to our operations.
•
the unlikely possibility that Parent will be unable to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration on the
Closing Date.
•
the requirement that the Company pay Parent the Termination Fee of $35.0 million and the Merger
Agreement Expenses in an amount not to exceed $5.0 million, upon certain termination circumstances. For
more information, see “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Treatment of Expenses.”
•
the possibility that the amounts that may be payable by the Company upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement, as set forth in “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Treatment of Expenses,” could
discourage other potential acquirers from making a competing bid to acquire the Company.
•
the restrictions on the Company’s conduct of business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including
the requirement that it conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which
may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the
completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, the Company might have pursued.
•
the fact that an all-cash transaction would be taxable to the Company’s stockholders that are U.S. Holders
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is unable to solicit other acquisition
proposals.
•
the fact that, by reason of the factors described immediately above, the likelihood of any third party
submitting to the Board or the Company (on an unsolicited basis pursuant to the “window shop”
exceptions to the Company’s no-solicitation covenant in the Merger Agreement) an Alternative Proposal
constituting or reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal is materially diminished.
•
the risk that, while the Merger is expected to be completed, there can be no assurance that all conditions to
the parties’ obligations to complete the Merger, including the Migration, will be satisfied, and as a result, it
is possible that the Merger may not be completed even if approved by the Company’s common
stockholders.
•
the risk that the Company is required to complete the Migration as a condition to Parent and Merger Sub’s
obligation to close the Merger, and that it is possible that after completing the Migration, Parent could
default on its obligation to close the Merger.
•
the fact that notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless the Merger
Agreement has been earlier terminated in accordance with the terms thereof, the Merger Agreement will,
subject to certain exceptions, be submitted to the Company’s common stockholders at the Special Meeting.
For more information, see “The Merger Agreement-Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation;
Intervening Events.”
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the
Merger and the substantial time and effort of the Company’s management required to complete the Merger,
which may disrupt the Company’s business operations.
•
the fact that the Company’s business, operations, financial results and liquidity position could suffer in the
event that the Merger is not consummated.
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of
termination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE.
•
the risk of litigation arising in respect of the Merger Agreement, the Merger, or the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
•
the fact that the completion of the Merger will require antitrust and other regulatory approvals in the United
States and certain other countries, including the requirement of Parent and the Company to use their
reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
applicable governmental authority.
•
the risk that the Migration may not be completed within the required timeframe such that the Closing can
take place prior to the End Date.
•
the fact that if the Merger is not consummated and the Migration has been completed, the Company will
have to take certain steps in order to modify its legal and tax structure in order to avoid possible negative
tax consequences.
•
the risk that the Company may not obtain the Migration Contract Consents such that the Closing can take
place prior to the End Date.
•
the fact that there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made
or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.
In addition, the Board was aware of and considered the interests that certain of our directors and executive officers
may have in the Merger that differ from, or are in addition to, those of our other stockholders. For more information,
please see “The Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The foregoing discussion is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but summarizes many, if not all, of the material factors
considered by the Board in its consideration of the Merger. After considering these and other factors, the Board
concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger outweighed the uncertainties and the risks. In view of the variety
of factors considered by the Board and the complexity of these factors, the Board did not find it practicable
58

to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination
and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board applied such member’s own personal business judgment
to the process and may have assigned different weights to different factors. The Board unanimously adopted the
Merger Agreement and approved the other transactions contemplated by thereby, including the Merger, and
unanimously recommends that common stockholders approve the Merger Proposal based upon the totality of the
information presented to, and considered by, the Board.

dated such date, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in

similar data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that
Centerview deemed relevant. Centerview also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the Transaction
with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Centerview deemed
relevant, and conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as
Centerview deemed appropriate.

of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by
Centerview for purposes of its opinion and, with the Company’s consent, Centerview relied upon such information as
being complete and accurate. In that regard, Centerview assumed, at the Company’s direction, that the Company
Internal Data (including, without limitation, the Company Forecasts) were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered
thereby and Centerview relied, at the Company’s direction, on the Company Internal Data for purposes of
Centerview’s analysis and opinion. Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the Company Internal Data or the
assumptions on which it was based. In addition, at the Company’s direction, Centerview did not make any

otherwise) of the Company, nor was Centerview furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and was not asked
to conduct, and did not conduct, a physical inspection of the properties or assets of the Company. Centerview

material to Centerview’s analysis or opinion from the Draft Agreement reviewed by Centerview. Centerview also
assumed, at the Company’s direction, that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay
or the waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material
to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental,
regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction,
condition or other change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or
Centerview’s opinion. Centerview did not evaluate and did not express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of

business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage.
Centerview’s opinion was limited to and addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of
Centerview’s written opinion, to the holders of shares of common stock (other than Excluded Common Shares) of the
Common Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. For purposes of its
opinion, Centerview was not asked to, and Centerview did not, express any view on, and its opinion did not address,
any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Transaction, including, without limitation, the structure or
form of the Transaction, or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered
into in connection with or otherwise contemplated by the Transaction, including, without limitation, the fairness of
the Transaction or any other term or aspect of the Transaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection
therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of any other class of securities, including holders of
shares of Preferred Stock, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or any other party. In addition,
Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other
aspect of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or
any party, or class of such persons in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Common Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise.
Further, Centerview expressed no opinion as to the consideration proposed to be paid to the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the fairness of the Common Merger Consideration relative to the

Summary of Centerview Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Board in connection
with Centerview’s opinion, dated June 17, 2021. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete
description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of, Centerview,
nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those
financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized
below should not be taken to be Centerview’s view of the actual value of the Company. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the
financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the
tables below without considering all financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses
or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview’s financial analyses and its opinion. In
performing its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company or any
other parties to the Transaction. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in
these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the Company
do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the Company may actually be sold. Accordingly, the
assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is
based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before June 15, 2021 and is not necessarily indicative
of current market conditions.
Selected Public Company Analysis
Centerview reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for the Company to
corresponding financial information, ratios and multiples for publicly traded companies that Centerview deemed
comparable, based on its experience and professional judgment, to the Company, which selected publicly traded
companies we refer to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the “selected companies”. The selected companies
consisted of:
•
Textainer Group Holdings Limited
•
Triton International Limited
Although neither of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, these companies were selected,
among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with certain operational and financial
characteristics, which, for purposes of its analyses, Centerview considered to be similar to those of the Company.
However, because neither of the selected companies is exactly the same as the Company, Centerview believed that it
was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company
analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional
judgment, concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of the
Company and the selected companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context
in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.
61
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources and closing stock prices as of
June 15, 2021, Centerview calculated for each company, the ratio of price of a share of such company’s common stock
to the company’s book value per share (a ratio referred to as “P/BV”). To arrive at each company’s book value per
share, Centerview divided the company’s total stockholders’ equity minus preferred equity, plus net deferred tax
liabilities by its fully diluted common shares outstanding. This analysis resulted in a median P/BV multiple, including
deferred tax liabilities, of 1.34x.
Based on its experience and professional judgment, for purposes of its analysis, Centerview selected a P/BV
reference range of 1.25x to 1.45x. In selecting this reference range, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on
its experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating
characteristics of the Company and the selected companies that could affect their public trading values in order to
provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. Centerview applied the P/BV reference
range to the Company’s first quarter 2021 book value, including deferred tax liabilities. Centerview calculated an
implied per share equity value range for each share of common stock of $46.02 to $53.35. Centerview then compared
these ranges to the implied value of the Common Merger Consideration of $56.00 per share of common stock.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based on the Company Forecasts, which
included both a “base case” and an “upside case.” A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation
methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows
of the asset. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows and is obtained by discounting those
future cash flows by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the
opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.
In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of illustrative equity values for the Company by applying a
discount rate range of 10.0% to 12.5% (reflecting Centerview’s analysis of the Company’s cost of equity) and the mid-
year convention to (a) the forecasted after-tax levered free cash flows of the Company for the last three fiscal quarters
of 2021 and for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 set forth in Company management’s base case and upside case
forecasts at the direction of the Company and assumptions discussed with the Company management and (b) a range
of illustrative terminal values for the Company, calculated by Centerview applying terminal price to next twelve-month
earnings multiples ranging from 6.0x to 8.0x terminal year net income. Centerview then divided these implied equity
values by the number of fully-diluted outstanding shares of common stock as of March 31, 2021, as set forth in the
Company Internal Data to derive a range of implied per share equity value for each share of common stock as of
March 31, 2021, of $37.55 to $50.15, based on the base case Company Forecasts, and $40.44 to $54.21, based on the
upside case Company Forecasts. Centerview then compared these ranges to the implied value of the Common Merger
Consideration of $56.00 per share of common stock.
Other Factors
Centerview noted for the Board certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other
things, the following:
•
Selected Public Company Analysis. Using the same P/BV reference range for the Company as described
above, Centerview noted the Company’s first quarter 2021 book value, excluding deferred tax liabilities,
implied a per share equity value range for each share of common stock of $44.21 to $51.25 per share of
common stock.
•
Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed the historical closing trading prices of the
shares of common stock for the 52-week period prior to June 15, 2021, which reflected low and high closing
trading prices during such 52-week period of $15.63 to $48.73 per share of common stock.
General
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it
considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Centerview’s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in
its evaluation of the Transaction. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative
of the views of the Board or management of the Company with respect to the Common Merger Consideration or as to
whether the Board would have been willing to determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration for
the Transaction was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was
approved by the Board. Centerview provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Centerview did not,
however recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or the Board or that any specific amount
of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Transaction.
Centerview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment
banking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion
Centerview had been engaged to provide financial advisory services to the Company, including in connection with
various strategic matters, and Centerview received approximately $1,000,000 in compensation from the Company for
such services. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview had not been engaged to provide
financial advisory or other services to Parent or Merger Sub, and Centerview did not receive any compensation from
Parent during such period. Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the
Company or Parent or their respective affiliates in the future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain
(i) of Centerview and Centerview affiliates’ directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such
persons, (ii) of Centerview’s affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which
any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold,
sell or trade, in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other
obligations) of, or investments in, the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates or any other relevant
parties that may be involved in the Transaction.
The Board selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction based on Centerview’s
reputation, knowledge of the Company and its industry, relationships with other potential strategic or financial
buyers and experience. Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the Transaction.
In connection with Centerview’s services as the financial advisor to the Board, the Company has agreed to pay
Centerview an aggregate fee that is estimated to be approximately $21,000,000, $1,000,000 of which was payable upon
the rendering of Centerview’s opinion and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the
Transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview’s expenses arising, and to
indemnify Centerview against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview’s engagement.
Management Projections",71,75
"CAI International, Inc._20210804_DEFM14A_19444962_4270736.Pdf",Management Projections,"Management Projections
The Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to its future
performance, revenues, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and
subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the Board’s consideration of
the Merger, the Company’s management prepared and developed unaudited financial projections regarding the
Company’s future performance for the fiscal years 2021 to 2025. On June 7, 2021, management discussed with the
Board a set of unaudited financial projections, with “base case” and “upside case” models (the “management
projections”). On June 10, 2021, the Board approved the use of the management projections by Centerview in
connection with its financial analysis, as described under “-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC.” A summary of the
management projections has been included below.
The management projections were made available to the Board and Centerview, but were not made available to, or
discussed with, potential purchasers, including Parent, in connection with the process resulting in the execution of
the Merger Agreement. The summary of the management projections set forth below is included herein only because
the management projections were used at the Board’s direction by Centerview in connection with its financial
analysis relating to the Common Merger Consideration, but the management projections were not distributed to
potential purchasers. However, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as an indication that any
party considered, or now considers, the management projections to be a reliable prediction of future results. The
management projections are subjective in many respects and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic
revisions based on actual experience and business developments. Although presented with numerical specificity, the
management projections are based upon, and reflect, numerous judgments, estimates and assumptions made by the
Company’s management with respect to, among other things, industry performance,
63TABLE OF CONTENTS
general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters
specific to the Company’s business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company’s
control. As such, the management projections constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results projected, including the factors
described under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” As a result, we cannot assure you that
the estimates and assumptions made in preparing the management projections will prove accurate, that the projected
results will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected results. In addition,
the management projections cover multiple years through fiscal year 2025 and such information by its nature
becomes less reliable with each successive year. Accordingly, this summary of the management projections is not
being included in this proxy statement to influence your decision whether to vote in favor of any proposal.
Some or all of the assumptions that have been made regarding, among other things, the occurrence or the timing of
certain events or impacts may have changed since the date the management projections were prepared, and the
summary of the management projections set forth below does not take into account any circumstances or events
occurring after the date the management projections were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger and
transaction-related expenses. The management projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the
Merger to occur and should not be viewed as accurate in that context.
The management projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure. The management projections are
included in this proxy statement only because they were made available to Centerview for use in connection with its
financial analysis, as described under “-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC,” but they were not distributed to
potential purchasers, including Parent, in connection with the process resulting in the execution of the Merger
Agreement. The management projections do not, and were not intended to, act as public guidance regarding our
financial performance. Accordingly, the inclusion of the management projections in this proxy statement should not
be regarded as an indication that Parent, the Board, the Company’s management, Centerview or any of their
respective affiliates or representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the
management projections to be predictive of future results. No one has made or makes any representation to any
stockholder regarding the information included in the management projections set forth below. We have made no
representation to Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement concerning these financial forecasts.
Furthermore, the management projections were not prepared with a view to compliance with (1) generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States; (2) the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections
and forward-looking statements; or (3) the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. KPMG LLP, our independent
registered public accounting firm, has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied procedures to the
management projections and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them. The
management projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the
Company’s management.
After-Tax Levered Free Cash Flow (as defined below) contained in the management projections set forth below is a
non-GAAP financial measure, which is a financial performance measure that is not calculated in accordance with
GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may
be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, which limits its usefulness
as a comparative measure. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they
exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. The items excluded from net
income to common stockholders to arrive at this non-GAAP financial measure are significant components for
understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance and liquidity. Accordingly, this non-GAAP
financial measure should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP.
Financial measures used by a financial advisor are excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures
under SEC rules and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures,
which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. A
reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure was not relied upon by Centerview for purposes of its financial
analysis as described above in “-Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC” or the Board in connection with its
consideration of the Merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure
included in the management projections to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any
responsibility, to update or otherwise revise the management projections to reflect circumstances existing after the
date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions
underlying the management projections are shown to be in error or no longer appropriate. In light of the foregoing
factors and the uncertainties inherent in the management projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on the projections included in this proxy statement.
The summaries of the financial forecasts performed by management include information presented in tabular
format. In order to fully understand management’s analyses and projections, the tables must be read together with
the assumptions underlying such forecasts. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of
management’s analyses and projections. Considering the data described below without considering the full
narrative description of management’s analyses and projections, including the assumptions underlying the
analyses and projections, could create a misleading or incomplete view of management’s analyses and projections.
In preparing the management projections, our management made the following material assumptions for each of the
base case and the upside case, except as noted below:
•
cost per standard cargo unit (new container pricing) of $2,989 in fiscal year 2021, $2,275 in fiscal year 2022
and $2,100 in each of fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025;
•
average utilization per fiscal year of 99.6% in fiscal year 2021, 98.8% in fiscal year 2022 and 98.0% in each of

•
total container investment per year of:
○
with respect to the base case, $1,100 million in fiscal year 2021 and $600.0 million in each of fiscal years
2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025; and
○
with respect to the upside case, $1,300 million in fiscal year 2021 and $700.0 million in each of fiscal
years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025;
•
gain on sale of containers of $16.3 million in fiscal year 2021, $9.0 million in fiscal year 2022, $9.5 million in
fiscal year 2023, $10.0 million in fiscal year 2024 and $10.5 million in fiscal year 2025;
•
handling cost as a percentage of total operating lease revenue of 1.0% in each of fiscal years 2021 through
2025;
•
repair costs as a percentage of total operating lease revenue of 2.0% in each of fiscal years 2021 through
2025;

Financing of the Merger",78,78

Consummation of the Merger is not subject to Parent’s ability to obtain financing.
The Company and Parent estimate that the total amount of funds required to complete the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby and pay related fees and expenses will be approximately $1.1 billion, with the exact
amount dependent upon the willingness of various of the Company’s existing financing sources to consent to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement..
We believe that Parent will have sufficient cash on the Closing Date to complete the Merger, but we cannot assure
you of that. Its amount of cash might be insufficient if, among other things, Parent’s cash position at the Closing
Date is materially different than at the date of the Merger Agreement.

Options
As a result of the Merger:
•
each Option that has a per share exercise price that is less than the Common Merger Consideration, will be
cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to such Option multiplied by (y) the excess of
$56.00 over the applicable per share exercise price of the Option, subject to any applicable withholding
taxes; and
•
each Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than $56.00 will, to the extent not
exercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled at the Effective Time with
no payment made therefor and will cease to represent a right to purchase shares of common stock.
RSUs and PRSUs
As a result of the Merger, each RSU and each PRSU will be cancelled and automatically converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive $56.00, in cash, without interest, for each share of common stock subject to the RSU or
PRSU, subject to any applicable withholding taxes.
RSAs
As a result of the Merger, each RSA will become fully vested and free of any applicable forfeiture restrictions,
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and each such share of common stock will cease to be
outstanding and will be converted into the right to receive $56.00, in cash, without interest, subject to any applicable
withholding taxes.
These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them, including the compensation that may become
payable in connection with the Merger to Messrs. Page and Hallahan and Ms. Cutino, who are our named executive
officers, are subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of our common stockholders and are quantified in the narrative
and tables below. For more information, please see “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive
Officer Compensation.” The dates used below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes
only and do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.
The Board voted in favor of approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger.
Equity Award Holdings
The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock subject to unvested Options, RSUs, PRSUs and
RSAs held by our directors and executive officers as of the Record Date under an Equity Incentive Plan and the
estimated value of these shares in the Merger, assuming continued service by the applicable director or executive
officer until consummation of the Merger and without giving effect to any lapse of forfeiture restrictions or vesting
acceleration as may apply in connection with the completion of the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger, these
awards will be treated as set forth in “-Treatment of Options, RSUs, PRSUs and RSAs,” above. The vested shares of
common stock held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares
of common stock held by other stockholders entitled to receive the Common Merger Consideration. For additional
information regarding the Options, RSUs and PRSUs held by our named executive officers, see “-Named Executive
Officer Golden Parachute Compensation.”
In calculating the amounts set forth in the table below, the following assumptions were used:
•
the Effective Time is July 30, 2021, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement;
•
the relevant price per share of our common stock is $56.00, which is equal to the Common Merger
Consideration;

•
the number of outstanding unvested Options, RSUs, PRSUs and RSAs held by each named individual is as
of July 30, 2021, noting that no Options, RSUs, PRSUs or RSAs have been granted to directors or executive

that will be cancelled and extinguished in exchange for the right to receive the Option Merger
Consideration, RSU and PRSU Merger Consideration or RSA Merger Consideration, as applicable, will

The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is expected to constitute a “change in
control” for purposes of each of the employment or service agreements discussed below.
Mr. Page
We initially entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Page effective mid-May 2011 in connection with his
appointment as our Chief Financial Officer, which was later amended in August 2016. In June 2020, we entered into a
new employment agreement (the “Page Employment Agreement”) with Mr. Page in connection with his promotion to
Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.
In the event Mr. Page’s employment is terminated for “Cause” (as defined in the Page Employment Agreement) or due
to Company insolvency, Mr. Page is entitled only to any accrued compensation and benefits through the effective
date of his termination. In addition, in the event Mr. Page’s employment is terminated without Cause, for death or
disability, or by Mr. Page for “Good Reason” (as defined in the Page Employment Agreement), and subject to Mr.
Page’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims against the Company and continued compliance
with certain restrictive covenants, Mr. Page is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 100% of his then-
current base salary, or, if such termination occurs within 24 months of a “Change in Control” (as defined in the Page
Employment Agreement), 200% of his then-current base salary, plus, in either case, a cash bonus equal to the average
of the annual cash bonus amounts paid over the preceding two years. Mr. Page is also entitled to COBRA health

“Hallahan Service Agreement”).
In the event Mr. Hallahan’s employment is terminated within 24 months following the occurrence of a “Change of

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the estimated amounts of compensation
that each of our named executive officers (as determined in accordance with SEC regulations) may receive in
connection with the Merger. In calculating the amounts set forth in the table below, the following assumptions were
used:
•
the Effective Time is July 30, 2021, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement;
•
the relevant price per share of our common stock is $56.00, which is equal to the Common Merger
Consideration;
•
performance conditions of each PRSU being deemed satisfied at 100% of the relevant target level of
achievement (notwithstanding any contrary provision in any agreement or document governing or
evidencing the relevant PRSU);
70TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
each such named executive officer’s employment is (i) with respect to Mr. Page and Ms. Cutino, terminated
without “Cause” or for “Good Reason;” or (ii) with respect to Mr. Hallahan, terminated for any reason other
than in connection with various circumstances that generally constitute a “bad leaver” termination (clause
(i) and (ii) together, a “Qualifying Termination”) on July 30, 2021, in each case, immediately following the
Effective Time;
•
that each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those
in effect as of the date of this proxy statement; and
•
equity awards that are outstanding as of July 30, 2021, remain outstanding through the consummation of
the Merger.
The compensation summarized in the table and footnotes below is subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of our
stockholders, as described in “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer
Compensation.” The amounts in the following table are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may not
actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not include amounts that the named
executive officers were entitled to receive or equity awards that were vested as of July 30, 2021. In addition, these
amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective
Time or any awards that, by their terms, vest irrespective of the Merger prior to July 30, 2021. As a result of the
foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the
assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive
officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.
For purposes of this discussion, “single trigger” refers to benefits that arise as a result of the completion of the
Merger and “double trigger” refers to benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger
and a Qualifying Termination within 24 months following the Merger.
The disclosures in the table below and the accompanying footnotes should be read in conjunction with the narrative
description of the compensation arrangements set forth above.

termination date and complying with such named executive officer’s continuing obligations to the Company, or (ii) with respect
to Mr. Hallahan, (a) complying with (and continuing to comply with) his obligations relating to confidentiality, intellectual
property, restrictive covenants, property and resignation as set out in the Hallahan Employment Agreement; (b) the application
of certain terms and conditions set forth in the Hallahan Employment Agreement; and (c) Mr. Hallahan executing such
documents in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company or his New Employer (as defined in the Hallahan Employment
Agreement), as applicable, as it may require to effect the termination of his employment and his resignation from any

Merger Consideration, as applicable. All awards under our Equity Incentive Plans (except as otherwise set forth in an
employment or service agreement or applicable award agreement), including shares subject to Options and RSUs that have not
vested will become fully vested and exercisable upon completion of the Merger, and therefore constitute “single trigger”
arrangements. Furthermore, the Board has taken such actions as are necessary to cause (i) the performance conditions of each
PRSU to be deemed satisfied at 100% of the relevant target level of achievement (notwithstanding any contrary provision in any
agreement or document governing or evidencing the relevant PRSU) and (ii) each Option, PRSU and RSU to become fully vested

The Closing will occur remotely via the electronic exchange of documents and signatures, as soon as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than four business days after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable
law and the Merger Agreement, waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in the Merger
Agreement and described in “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Contribution, Migration Filings and Merger,”
including the Migration (other than such conditions as may, by their terms, only be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the Merger Agreement,

The Merger will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of

possible that factors outside the control of the Company or Parent could delay the consummation of the Merger, or

Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by our common stockholders
of the Merger Proposal, the completion of the Migration and receipt of regulatory approval, we currently anticipate
that the Merger will be completed in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2021. However, the exact timing of
completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions, including the
completion of the Migration, each as described in “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Contribution, Migration
Filings and Merger,” many of which are outside of our control.
Other Matters

If the Merger is completed, holders of shares of our common stock who do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal
and holders of shares of Preferred Stock, as applicable, and who properly demand an appraisal of their shares and
who otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to statutory
appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 of the
DGCL is required. Failure to timely and properly comply with such statutory requirements will result in the loss of
your appraisal rights.
This section summarizes certain material provisions of the DGCL pertaining to appraisal rights. The following
discussion, however, is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement and incorporated by reference herein. All references within Section 262 of the DGCL to “stockholder” are to
the record holder of shares of our common stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable. The following discussion
does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a
stockholder should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under the DGCL, if you hold one or more shares of our common stock, do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal,
or hold one or more shares of our Preferred Stock, and you continuously are the record holder of such shares
through the Effective Time and otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you will
be entitled to have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive the “fair value” of such
shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger or related transactions) in cash, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value. It is possible that any such “fair value” as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the applicable Merger Consideration which
stockholders will be entitled to receive upon the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
These rights are known as appraisal rights.
73TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, not less than 20 days prior to the Special Meeting at which the adoption of the
Merger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, we must notify each stockholder who was a stockholder on
the Record Date and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the
notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement constitutes the required notice, and a copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein.
A HOLDER OF COMMON STOCK AND/OR PREFERRED STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL
RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO SHOULD REVIEW THE FOLLOWING
DISCUSSIONS AND ANNEX C CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO COMPLY PRECISELY WITH THE PROCEDURES OF
SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL IN A TIMELY AND PROPER MANNER WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF
APPRAISAL RIGHTS. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT
TO SEEK APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, A HOLDER OF COMMON STOCK AND/OR
PREFERRED STOCK WHO IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO EXERCISE ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS, IS
ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. ANY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK
AND/OR PREFERRED STOCK HELD BY A STOCKHOLDER WHO FAILS TO PERFECT, SUCCESSFULLY
WITHDRAWS OR OTHERWISE LOSES HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE
BEEN CONVERTED AS OF THE EFFECTIVE TIME INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE APPLICABLE MERGER

If you are a stockholder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of common stock and/or
Preferred Stock, as applicable, you must comply with ALL of the following:
•
to the extent you are entitled to vote, you must NOT vote “FOR,” or otherwise consent in writing to, the
Merger Proposal. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting
instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, if you submit a proxy and wish
to exercise your appraisal rights, you must include voting instructions to vote your shares “AGAINST,” or
as an abstention with respect to, the Merger Proposal;
•
prior to the taking of the vote of common stockholders on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, you
must deliver a proper written demand for appraisal of your shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock;
•
you must continuously hold your shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock from the date of making
the demand through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer your shares of
common stock and/or Preferred Stock before the Effective Time; and
•
you, another stockholder, an appropriate beneficial owner or the surviving corporation must file a petition
in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of your shares of common
stock and/or Preferred Stock within 120 days after the Effective Time. The surviving corporation is under no
obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so.
Accordingly, it is the obligation of stockholders to initiate all necessary action to properly demand their
appraisal rights in respect of shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, within the time
prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Filing a Written Demand",86,86
"CAI International, Inc._20210804_DEFM14A_19444962_4270736.Pdf",Filing a Written Demand,"Filing a Written Demand
To the extent a holder is entitled to vote, neither voting against the Merger Proposal, nor abstaining from voting or
failing to vote on the Merger Proposal, will in and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. Any holder of shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock wishing to
exercise appraisal rights must deliver to us, before the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special
Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares. A stockholder’s failure to deliver the written
demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of
appraisal rights. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to, and separate from, any proxy or vote on the
Merger Proposal.
A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. Only a holder of record may
demand appraisal rights for the shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, registered in that
74TABLE OF CONTENTS
holder’s name. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs us of the identity of the stockholder and that
the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of the “fair value” of his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners who do not
also hold their shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, of record may not directly make
appraisal demands to us. The beneficial owner must, in such case, arrange for the holder of record, such as a broker,
bank or other nominee, to timely submit the required demand in respect of those shares of common stock or Preferred
Stock. A holder of record, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, who holds shares of common stock or Preferred
Stock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of common
stock or Preferred Stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial
owners. The written demand should state the number of shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock as to which
appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of common stock or Preferred Stock is expressly mentioned, the
demand will be presumed to cover all shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, held in the name
of the holder of record.
IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK
ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU
SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BROKER, BANK, TRUSTEE OR OTHER NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK, TRUSTEE OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A
DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF
COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH
AS A NOMINEE OR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO
FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO DEMAND YOUR APPRAISAL
RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED STOCK THROUGH A
BROKERAGE OR BANK WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES

SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY, OR ON BEHALF OF, THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY
THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD.
If your shares of common stock or Preferred Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, execution of the demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if your shares are
owned of record jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand for
appraisal should be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for
two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must
identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is
acting as agent for the holder or holders of record. Stockholders who hold their shares of common stock or Preferred
Stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult
with their brokers or other nominees to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal
by such a nominee.
If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand

At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder that made a demand for appraisal but has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined in such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw
the demand and to accept the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her
or its shares of common stock or Preferred Stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of
the demand for appraisal, but after such 60 day period a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written
approval of the surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed
as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may
75
TABLE OF CONTENTS
withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the applicable Merger Consideration within 60 days after the
Effective Time. If CAI, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal
when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder’s demand
in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not
approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to
receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal
to or more than the applicable Merger Consideration.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation. Within 10 days after the Effective Time, CAI, as the surviving corporation,
must notify each holder of common stock and Preferred Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL and, to the extent they are entitled to vote, has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal
of the date that the Merger has become effective.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but
not later, either you, provided you have complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and are otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, or the surviving corporation may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in
the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by
you, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of common stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, held by all
stockholders who have properly demanded statutory appraisal. None of Parent, Merger Sub or CAI, as the surviving
corporation is under any obligation to file an appraisal petition or has any intention to do so. If you desire to have
your shares of common stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary
for properly demanding your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of
the DGCL. The failure of a holder of common stock or Preferred Stock to file such a petition within the time periods
specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, you will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth
the aggregate number of shares of common stock not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and Preferred Stock, in
each case, with respect to which we have received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of
those shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of (i) 10 days after receipt by
the surviving corporation of the request therefor or (ii) 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands
for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of common stock or Preferred Stock held in a voting trust or by
a nominee on your behalf you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the surviving
corporation the statement described in this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or if you deliver to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of your
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter
with the written approval of the surviving corporation, then the right to appraisal will cease.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record of common stock or Preferred Stock who has
properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and a
copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will be obligated, within 20
days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Court of Chancery a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of common stock
and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving corporation. After notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by
registered or certified mail to the surviving corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the
petition to determine which stockholders have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and have become entitled to
appraisal rights and may require the stockholders demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares of common stock
or Preferred Stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency
of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any
stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. Such notice shall also be given by one or more publications at
least one week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the
notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs thereof shall
be borne by the surviving corporation. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as
to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (a) with respect to the shares of
76
TABLE OF CONTENTS
common stock, (i) the total number of shares of common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding
shares of common stock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares
of common stock exceeds $1.0 million, or (b) with respect to each series of Preferred Stock, (i) the total number of
shares of such series of Preferred Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of such series of
Preferred Stock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares of such
series of Preferred Stock exceeds $1.0 million, as applicable.
The appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of common stock or Preferred Stock owned by such
stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine
the fair value of the shares of common stock and Preferred Stock held by all stockholders who have properly
demanded their appraisal rights as of the Effective Time, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to
be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the Effective Time through the
date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time
and the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any stockholder
entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to
trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder
whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving corporation and who has submitted such stockholder’s
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which
case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest
theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same,
forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders to the surviving
corporation of their stock certificates.
In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining
fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that
“[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” An opinion of
an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger
is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of common stock and
Preferred Stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as or less than the
applicable Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor CAI, as the surviving corporation, anticipates offering more than
the applicable Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in
any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of common stock
or Preferred Stock is less than the Common Merger Consideration, the Series A Merger Consideration or the Series B
Merger Consideration, as applicable. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time, you will lose the right to an appraisal
and will instead receive the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement, in cash,
without interest, subject to deductions of any applicable withholding taxes.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include
attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) and may tax those costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court
of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against
the value of all shares of common stock and Preferred Stock, as applicable, entitled to appraisal. In the absence of
such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you will not, from and after the
Effective Time, be entitled to vote your shares subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or
other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of common
stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, as of a record date prior to the Effective Time.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw
a demand for appraisal and accept the applicable Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the
demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the consideration payable in the Merger to the surviving corporation,
except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of
the surviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms
the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any
stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in
the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to properly demand or successfully withdraw your
demand for appraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares will be deemed to have been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, in cash, without interest, subject
to deductions of any applicable withholding taxes.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for properly demanding appraisal rights may result in
the loss of your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration for
your shares in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders
of shares of our capital stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based
on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive
basis, and any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.
This discussion does not address Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, nor does it address any tax
considerations under state, local or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal
income tax. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore, could be subject to challenge,
which could be sustained. No ruling is intended to be sought from the IRS with respect to the Merger.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our capital stock that
is:
•
a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
•
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s
administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S.
person; or
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our capital stock, other than a
partnership or other entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is not a U.S. Holder.
78TABLE OF CONTENTS
This discussion applies only to holders of shares of our capital stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within
the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not
purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder in light of its particular
circumstances, or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws
(including, for example, insurance companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies,
dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of tax
accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result
of any item of gross income with respect to shares of our capital stock being taken into account in an applicable
financial statement, persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations,
banks and certain other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain expatriates, partnerships, S corporations, or other
pass-through entities or investors in partnerships or such other entities, persons who hold shares of our capital
stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, U.S. Holders who will hold, directly or
indirectly, an equity interest in the surviving corporation in the Merger, and persons who acquired their shares of our
capital stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements).
If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) holds shares of our capital stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally
depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding
shares of our capital stock, you should consult your tax advisor.
Holders of shares of our capital stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, and any
state, local, foreign or other tax laws.
Consequences to U.S. Holders",90,91
"CAI International, Inc._20210804_DEFM14A_19444962_4270736.Pdf",Consequences to U.S. Holders,"Consequences to U.S. Holders
Declared but Unpaid Dividends by U.S. Holders
To the extent that cash received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger is attributable to any declared but unpaid
dividends on such holders’ capital stock, such payments will be treated as dividends to the extent of our current or
accumulated earnings and profits as determined under the Code. Any portion of such payments that exceeds such
earnings and profits will first be applied to reduce a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such holder’s shares of capital
stock on a share-by-share basis, and the excess will be treated as gain from the disposition of the shares, the tax
treatment of which is discussed under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger -
Consequences to U.S. Holders-Exchange of Shares Pursuant to the Merger.”
Under current law, dividends received by individual holders of capital stock generally will be subject to a reduced
graduated tax rates of up to 20% if such dividends are treated as “qualified dividend income” for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Amounts treated as return of capital are tax-free to the extent of the applicable tax basis. Amounts
classified as long-term capital gains generally are subject to the same graduated rates. Individual stockholders should
consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of these rules in light of their particular
circumstances.
Dividends received by corporate stockholders generally will be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Each
domestic corporate holder of capital stock is urged to consult with its tax advisors with respect to the eligibility for
and the amount of any dividends received deduction and the potential application of the “extraordinary dividend”
rules of Section 1059 of the Code to any declared but unpaid dividends it may receive on our capital stock.
Exchange of Shares Pursuant to the Merger
The receipt of cash by U.S. Holders in exchange for shares of our capital stock pursuant to the Merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the discussion above with respect to declared but
unpaid dividends under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger-Consequences to U.S.
Holders-Declared but Unpaid Dividends by U.S. Holders,” in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.
Holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of our capital stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received (computed as if there were
no applicable withholding taxes) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares, which generally will
equal the price the U.S. Holder paid for such shares.
79TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a U.S. Holder’s holding period in the shares of our capital stock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year
as of the date of the Merger, the gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains
of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential
rates (currently at a rate of 20%). The deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject to
limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of shares of our capital stock at different times and different
prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each
block of shares of our capital stock (i.e., shares of our capital stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction).",91,92

Exchange of Shares Pursuant to the Merger
A Non-U.S. Holder whose shares of our capital stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless:
•
gain on such shares is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or
business (and, if required by any applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent
establishment or fixed base of the Non-U.S. Holder);
•
the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the
taxable year in which the Merger occurs and certain other conditions are satisfied; or
•
the Company is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) as defined in Section 897
of the Code at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger or, if shorter, the Non-U.S.
Holder’s holding period for its shares of our capital stock, as applicable, and one of the circumstances
below applies to you.
Any gain recognized by a Non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net income basis at regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such
holder were a “U.S. person” as defined under the Code. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may also be subject
to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income
tax treaty) on after-tax profits effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax
profits are not reinvested and maintained in the U.S. business.
Gain described in the second bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30% rate, or a
reduced rate if specified by an applicable income tax treaty, but may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses, if
any, of the Non-U.S. Holder recognized in the same taxable year.
With respect to the third bullet above, generally, the Company will be a USRPHC if the fair market value of our U.S.
real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market values of our worldwide (domestic and
foreign) real property interests and other assets used or held for use in a trade or business, all as determined under
applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. We believe that we currently are not a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and we do not expect to become a USRPHC prior to the Closing. However, even if we were to be a
USRPHC, so long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, common stock held by
a Non-U.S. Holder would be treated as a U.S. real property interest only if the Non-U.S. Holder actually or
constructively held more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the shorter of the five-year period
preceding the disposition or the Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period for shares of our common stock. If a Non-U.S.
Holder holds Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock or acquired interests in the Company on more
than one date, the holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the application of these rules. If shares of our
capital stock were to be treated as a U.S. real property interest with respect to a holder, any gain recognized by such
Non-U.S. Holder with respect to such interest would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at
regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such holder were a “U.S. person” as defined
under the Code.
Declared but Unpaid Dividends by Non-U.S. Holders
To the extent that any cash received by Non-U.S. Holders pursuant to the Merger is attributable to any declared but
unpaid dividends on such Non-U.S. Holders’ capital stock, such payments will be treated as dividends to the extent
of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under the Code and may be subject to
withholding as discussed below. Any portion of such payments that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings
80TABLE OF CONTENTS
and profits will first be applied to reduce a Non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Non-U.S. Holder’s capital
stock and, to the extent such portion exceeds the Non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis, the excess will be treated as
gain from the disposition of the shares, the tax treatment of which is discussed under “Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger - Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders - Exchange of Shares Pursuant to the
Merger.”
Dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder of capital stock will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30%
rate or a reduced rate if specified by an applicable income tax treaty. However, dividends that are effectively
connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States (and, if required
by any applicable income tax treaty, attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base of the Non-
U.S. Holder) are not subject to the withholding tax, provided that certain certification and disclosure requirements are
satisfied, including completing IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form). Instead, such dividends generally will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same
manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a “U.S. person” as defined under the Code, unless an applicable income tax
treaty applies. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a
rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on after-tax profits effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax profits are not reinvested and maintained in
the U.S. business.
A Non-U.S. Holder of capital stock who wishes to claim the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty rate and avoid
backup withholding, as discussed below, for dividends will be required to (i) complete IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-
8BEN-E (or other applicable form) and certify under penalty of perjury that such holder is not a United States person
as defined under the Code and is eligible for treaty benefits, or (ii) if the capital stock is held through certain foreign
intermediaries, satisfy the relevant certification requirements of applicable Treasury regulations.

"CAI International, Inc._20210804_DEFM14A_19444962_4270736.Pdf",Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,"Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for shares of our capital stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject, under certain
circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup
withholding, a U.S. Holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return IRS Form W-9,
certifying that such U.S. Holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and such U.S.
Holder is not subject to backup withholding. In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal backup
withholding and information reporting with respect to cash payments to the Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger
if the Non-U.S. Holder has provided the applicable IRS Form W-8.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the
required information to the IRS in a timely manner.
Additional Withholding Considerations",93,93

Pursuant to legislation commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), foreign financial
institutions (which include most foreign hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, securitization vehicles and
other investment vehicles) and certain other foreign entities must comply with information reporting rules with
respect to their U.S. account holders and investors or pay a withholding tax on U.S.-source payments made to them
(whether received as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary for another party). More specifically, a foreign financial
institution or other foreign entity that does not comply with the FATCA reporting requirements will generally be
subject to a 30% withholding tax with respect to any “withholdable payments.” For this purpose, withholdable
payments generally include U.S.-source payments otherwise subject to nonresident withholding tax (e.g., U.S.-source
dividends, including any declared but unpaid dividends).
This summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is
not tax advice. Holders of shares of our capital stock should consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax
consequences to them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and the
effect of any federal, state, local, foreign and other tax laws.

Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until
notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and any applicable

statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On July 9, 2021, both the Company and Parent filed their
respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Parties are also required to make such other filings with any
other governmental entities that may be required under applicable regulatory laws, including without limitation, any
such filings required pursuant to the regulatory laws of (i) the Republic of Korea and Turkey and (ii) any other
countries outside of the United States, in each case, pertaining to pre-merger notification and regulation of terms and

At any time before or after the Effective Time, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take action under the antitrust
laws, including seeking to prevent the Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally approve the Merger upon
the divestiture of assets of the Company or Parent or subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition,
U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the
public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or permitting completion
of the Merger subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust
laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will
not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.
Parent and the Company are required to use their reasonable best efforts to take any and all action, and to do or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger, including as reasonably
promptly as practicable taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act, the
Foreign Regulatory Laws and any other approvals required from any governmental authority. Parent and the
Company are required to use their reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in any court with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the FTC, the DOJ
or any other applicable governmental authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement,
(i) Parent will not be required to (and the Company will not, without the consent of Parent) (x) propose, negotiate,
commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
business, product line, asset, contractual right, or relationship of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its subsidiaries) or (y) otherwise take or commit to any action that after the Closing may limit Parent’s
or its subsidiaries’ or its affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries) freedom of action with respect to, or
its or their ability to operate or retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or its
subsidiaries or affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries) or (z) enter into, or be required to take, any
settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any governmental authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) Parent will not be required to, and the Company
and its subsidiaries will not be required to (and will not without the consent of Parent), take any actions which would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent has the right to direct all matters with any
governmental authority consistent with its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Merger Agreement, Parent will make all strategic decisions and lead all discussions, negotiations and other
proceedings, and coordinate all activities with respect to any requests that may be made by, or any actions, consents,
undertakings, approvals, or waivers that may be sought by or from, any governmental authority, in connection with
obtaining governmental approvals for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under the HSR Act or
any other regulatory laws and will take any and all steps necessary to promptly vacate, reverse or overturn any
adverse decree judgment, permanent injunction or other order, including agreeing to take any of the actions set forth
above, including determining the strategy for contesting, litigating or otherwise responding to objections to, or
proceedings challenging, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, in each case, subject to good faith consultations with the Company reasonably in advance and in
consideration of the Company’s views.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent there is a conflict between the foregoing and with respect to actions to
be taken in connection with the Migration, the actions to be taken in connection with the Migration, as set forth in
“The Merger Agreement-The Migration,” will control and govern.

Furthermore, as promptly as practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement, the Company will, and will
cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide all notices and obtain the Migration Contract

subject to certain exceptions and the delivery of certain bring-down certificates by each of the Company and Parent
on the Bring-Down Date, the Company will deliver its certificate, and Parent will deliver its certificate. Promptly
following delivery of the certificates contemplated by the foregoing sentence, the Company will, and will cause its
subsidiaries to effect the Contribution.
One business day after the completion of the Contribution (and no earlier than one business day after the completion
of the Contribution), the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make
the Migration Filings, and thereafter effect the Migration as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Closing will not occur earlier than on the next

about the Company in its public reports filed with the SEC. The representations, warranties, covenants and

were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (ii) were made solely for the benefit
of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (iii) may be qualified and subject to important qualifications, limitations
and supplemental information agreed to by the parties to the Merger Agreement in connection with negotiating the
terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of
materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and, in some cases,
were qualified by matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by the Company in the Company Disclosure Schedule,
which disclosures were not reflected in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may
have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to
the Merger Agreement, rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality
applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries
under the Merger Agreement (other than to enforce payment of the applicable Merger Consideration after the
Effective Time) and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any
descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, Parent, or Merger
Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may have changed after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent
information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures, and such representations and
warranties do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement. Accordingly, you should not rely on
such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts at the time they were made or as
of the date of this proxy statement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as
actual limitations on the respective businesses of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take
certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company in
connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which
consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as
Annex A to this proxy statement, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to
provide you with any other factual information regarding the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective

Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is
completed, the Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. The Company will be the surviving
corporation in the Merger and will continue its corporate existence as a Delaware corporation after the Merger, and all
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all claims, obligations,
liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger Sub, shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts
and duties of the surviving corporation.
The surviving corporation will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and our current stockholders will cease to
have any ownership interest in the surviving corporation or rights as our stockholders. Therefore, our current
stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of the surviving corporation and will not benefit
from any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation that could be realized as a result of improvements to the
surviving corporation’s operations.
The certificate of incorporation of the Company will be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub (other than the corporate name) until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable laws. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
bylaws of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable laws.
Subject to applicable law, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial
directors of the surviving corporation, and the officers of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the initial officers of the surviving corporation.
Following the completion of the Merger, the Company’s common stock and Preferred Stock will no longer be publicly
traded and will be delisted from NYSE. In addition, the Company’s common stock and Preferred Stock will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will no longer file periodic or current reports with the SEC.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The Closing of the Merger will take place remotely via the electronic exchange of documents and signatures, on a
date no later than four business days after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the
Merger Agreement, waiver by the party having the benefit of the applicable condition of the closing conditions
stated in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the Merger Agreement,
waiver by the party having the benefit of the applicable condition of such conditions) or at such other date and time
as the parties to the Merger Agreement may mutually agree in writing.
The Merger will become effective at the time the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (or at such later time as is agreed upon by the parties to the Merger Agreement and specified in the
certificate of merger). We expect to complete the Merger as promptly as practicable after our common stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement (assuming the prior satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of the
other closing conditions to the Merger, including the Migration, as described below under the caption “-Conditions
to the Contribution, Migration Filings and Merger”). As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete
the Merger in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2021; however, consummation of the Merger is subject to
the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions to the completion of the
Merger, including the Migration, more fully described below under the caption “-Conditions to the Contribution,
Migration Filings and Merger” and we cannot specify when, or assure you that, the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub will satisfy or waive all or any conditions to the Merger. There may be a substantial amount of time between the
date of the Special Meeting and the consummation of the Merger and it is possible that factors outside the control of
the Company or Parent could delay the consummation of the Merger, or prevent the Merger from being
consummated.

At the Effective Time, except as noted below, each share of our common stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled and
85TABLE OF CONTENTS
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive $56.00 in cash, without interest, subject to deductions of any
applicable withholding taxes (the “Common Merger Consideration”). The following shares of common stock will not
receive the Common Merger Consideration:
•
shares held by Parent or Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent, which shares will be automatically
cancelled without consideration;
•
shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger by a stockholder who did not vote in
favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who have complied in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and
which shares will be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares as may be determined to be due to
such holders pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (unless and until such holder has failed to perfect or has
effectively withdrawn or lost rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL); and
•
treasury shares owned directly by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, which shares will be automatically cancelled without consideration (collectively, the “Excluded
Shares”).
At the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate formerly representing any shares of common stock or evidence of
shares in book-entry form (other than shares for which appraisal rights have been properly demanded, perfected and
not withdrawn or lost under Section 262 of the DGCL) will no longer have any rights with respect to such shares,
except for the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration upon surrender thereof. See “The Merger-Appraisal
Rights” for more information regarding appraisal rights.
At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation.

The Board has taken such actions as are necessary to cause (i) the performance conditions of each PRSU to be
deemed satisfied at 100% of the relevant target level of achievement (notwithstanding any contrary provision in any
agreement or document governing or evidencing the relevant PRSU) and (ii) each Option and RSA to become fully

Options
As a result of the Merger:
•
each Option that has a per share exercise price that is less than $56.00, will be cancelled at the Effective
Time in exchange for an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number
of shares of common stock subject to such Option multiplied by (y) the excess of $56.00 over the applicable
per share exercise price of the Option (the “Option Merger Consideration”), subject to any applicable
withholding taxes; and

•
each Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than $56.00 will, to the extent not
exercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled at the Effective Time with
no payment made therefor and will cease to represent a right to purchase shares of common stock.
RSUs and PRSUs
As a result of the Merger, each RSU and PRSU will be cancelled and automatically converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive $56.00, in cash, without interest, for each share of common stock subject to the RSU or PRSU
(the “RSU and PRSU Merger Consideration”), subject to any applicable withholding taxes.
RSAs
As a result of the Merger, each RSA will become fully vested and free of any applicable forfeiture restrictions,
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and each such share of common stock will cease to be
outstanding and will be converted into the right to receive $56.00, in cash, without interest, subject to any applicable
withholding taxes (the “RSA Merger Consideration”).
ESPP
Simultaneously in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company: (i) caused any offering
period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased) in progress under the ESPP as of the date of the
Merger Agreement to be the final offering period under the ESPP and to be terminated as of the date of the Merger
Agreement; (ii) made any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period (or
similar period), but otherwise treated such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP; and (iii) caused each participant’s then-outstanding ESPP
Rights to terminate as of the Final Exercise Date. The Company will terminate the ESPP no later than the Effective
Time.
On the Final Exercise Date, to the extent sufficient funds were credited as of such date under the ESPP within the
associated accumulated payroll withholding accounts for participants to fund a share purchase for a reasonable
number of shares of common stock, then such funds were used to purchase shares of common stock in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP, and otherwise the current offering period terminated without a final purchase. Each share
purchased under the ESPP prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive the Common Merger Consideration, subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the “ESPP Merger
Consideration”). No further ESPP Rights will be granted or exercised under the ESPP after the Final Exercise Date.
As of the date of this proxy statement, there are no outstanding ESPP Rights.
As used in this summary of the Merger Agreement, “Merger Consideration” means the Common Merger
Consideration, the Series A Preferred Merger Consideration, the Series B Preferred Merger Consideration, the Option
Merger Consideration, the RSU and PRSU Merger Consideration, the RSA Merger Consideration or the ESPP Merger
Consideration, as applicable.

At least three business days prior to the Closing Date, Parent will designate and enter into an agreement with a
paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to make all payments to the stockholders of the Company in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, as described above. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the paying agent an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration.
Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event, no later than the second business day following the Effective
Time), Parent will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, of our shares a letter of transmittal and instructions advising such holders how to surrender their certificates in
exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. The paying agent will pay by check or wire transfer to each holder
of record of certificated shares the applicable Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to receive upon the
paying agent’s receipt of (i) surrendered certificates, (ii) a signed letter of transmittal and (iii) any other items
reasonably required by the paying agent.
Holders of record of shares holding book-entry shares do not need to surrender any certificate or complete a letter of
transmittal in order to receive payment from the paying agent. Upon receipt by the paying agent of an
87TABLE OF CONTENTS
“agent’s message” (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the paying agent may reasonably request), Parent
will cause the paying agent to issue and deliver to each holder of shares represented in book-entry form, a check or
wire transfer for the amount of the applicable Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in respect
of such shares held by such holder.
Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of the applicable Merger Consideration. The surviving corporation will
reduce the amount of any applicable Merger Consideration paid to you by any applicable withholding taxes. YOU
SHOULD NOT FORWARD YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES TO THE PAYING AGENT WITHOUT A LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RETURN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED
PROXY CARD.
At the Effective Time, we will close our stock transfer books. After our stock transfer books are closed, there will be
no transfer of shares of common stock or Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time on the stock transfer books of the Company.
If any cash deposited with the paying agent is not claimed within 12 months following the Effective Time, such cash
will be returned to the surviving corporation or its designee, and any holders of certificates or book-entry shares as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) who have not complied with the share
exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement may thereafter only look to the surviving corporation for, only as a
general creditor thereof, payment of their claims for the applicable Merger Consideration.
If the paying agent is to pay some or all of a stockholder’s applicable Merger Consideration to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered certificate is registered, it is a condition of payment that such certificate be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer or that any book-entry shares be properly transferred, and,
in each case, that the person requesting payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required or have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or the paying agent that such tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if you have lost the share certificate or if it has been stolen or
destroyed. If you have lost a stock certificate, or if it has been stolen or destroyed, then, you will have to provide an
affidavit to that fact and, if required by the surviving corporation, post a bond in such reasonable amount as the
surviving corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
stock certificate.",99,100

"CAI International, Inc._20210804_DEFM14A_19444962_4270736.Pdf",Proxy Statement and Special Meeting,"Proxy Statement and Special Meeting
The Merger Agreement provides that, as soon as reasonably practicable after June 17 2021, the date of the Merger
Agreement (but in no event later than 15 business days after such date), the Company will, in consultation with
Parent, prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the “Proxy Statement”) relating to the Special Meeting to be held for purposes of voting upon
the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
In addition, the Company is required to, after the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement, (i) establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Special Meeting and (ii) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of shares of common stock as of the
record date established for the Special Meeting, and cause the Special Meeting to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable following such mailing (but in no event more than 45 days after the date of such mailing). This proxy
statement fulfills such obligation.
Notwithstanding the above, the Company may not adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting without the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as required by applicable law,
(ii) if the Company reasonably believes in good faith that it is necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment
to the Proxy Statement that is legally required or may be advisable (including in the event that, and respect of, any
objection that is raised by any stockholder of the Company to the sufficiency or accuracy of the Proxy Statement) is
timely provided to the stockholders of the Company, or (iii) to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting, or if on the date of the Special
Meeting, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of common stock
necessary to obtain the Stockholder Approval and except to the extent that the Board has made a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by (and solely pursuant to the terms of) the Merger Agreement, the Company
will continue to use all reasonable best efforts to assist in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating to the
Stockholder Approval; provided, that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Special Meeting may not be
postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 10 days after the date for which the then most-recent Special
Meeting was scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable law).
The Company agreed that no matters will be brought before the Special Meeting other than the Merger Proposal, the
Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal. The Company also agreed to keep Parent informed on a
reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and proxy tallies following the dissemination of the Proxy
Statement to stockholders; provided, that the Company will, upon the request of Parent, use its reasonable best
efforts to cause Georgeson to advise Parent on a not less than daily basis during the last 10 business days prior to
the date of the Special Meeting as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to the
Stockholder Approval.

As used in this proxy statement, an “Alternative Proposal” means any inquiry, offer, indication of interest or proposal
from any third party or group of third parties (other than Parent and its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub) that: (a)
relates to the acquisition directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, of (i) 15% or more of
the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on the fair market value of such assets and
including in the valuation of such assets or the capital stock of the Company’s subsidiaries) or (ii) any amount of
voting equity interests in the Company or one of its subsidiaries, which, together with any other voting equity
interests beneficially owned by such third party, would be equal to 15% or more of the issued and outstanding voting
equity interests in the Company; (b) involves any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result
94TABLE OF CONTENTS
in any such third party owning, directly or indirectly, voting equity interests in the Company or of its subsidiaries
equal to 15% or more of the voting equity interests in the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of the Company; (c) involves
any merger, consolidation, business combination, binding share exchange or similar transaction, in each case,
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which any such third party (or the stockholders of such
third party) would own, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company, the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or one or more of the Company’s subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of the Company, or, in the case
of a merger, of the surviving entity in such merger; or (d) involves any recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution, in
each case, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that are operating subsidiaries and material to the business of
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Except as permitted by the terms of the Merger Agreement described below, until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with the Superior Proposal Termination
Provision, the Company is not permitted to, may not allow its subsidiaries to, nor authorize or permit its and its
subsidiaries representatives to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate, or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Alternative
Proposal or the making of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative
Proposal;
•
subject to certain exceptions described below:
○
conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose or afford access to any non-
public information relating to the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, to, or to knowingly assist,
participate in, knowingly facilitate, or knowingly encourage any effort by, any third party that is
seeking to make, or has made, any Alternative Proposal;
○
except where the Board (or a committee thereof) makes a good faith determination, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, amend or grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries; or
enter into any agreement, letter of intent, term sheet or other agreement relating to any Alternative
Proposal (each, a “Company Acquisition Agreement”).
Except as expressly permitted as described below, until the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of the Merger
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with the Superior Proposal Termination Provision, the Company is further
required to cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted
prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement with respect to any Alternative Proposal, and must use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (and must send written notice demanding that) any such third party (or its
agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
return or destroy all such information.
However, the Board (or a committee thereof), directly or indirectly through any representative, may, prior to the
receipt of the Stockholder Approval and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement described in the following
paragraph: (i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party, that has made (and not withdrawn) a
bona fide Alternative Proposal in writing that was not solicited in violation of the Company’s obligations under the
Merger Agreement and that the Board (or a committee thereof) believes in good faith, after consultation with the
Company’s outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal; (ii) enter into, and thereafter furnish to such third party non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, an executed confidentiality agreement (a copy of such third party
non-public information (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously made available by the
Company to Parent) and such acceptable confidentiality agreement will be provided to Parent substantially
contemporaneously); and (iii) following receipt of and on account of a Superior Proposal, and subject to the terms of
the Merger Agreement, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with the Superior Proposal Termination Provision; or (iv) take any action that any
court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take (which order remains unstayed), but in each case referred
to

TABLE OF CONTENTS
in clauses (i) through (iv), only if the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law or in violation of any order of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Board is
also permitted to disclose to the Company’s stockholders a position under Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to an Alternative Proposal, if the Board (or a committee thereof) determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation of
applicable law, but this permission to disclose does not permit the Board to make or disclose a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, except to the extent otherwise permitted by the Merger Agreement, as described below.
Furthermore, the Board or any committee thereof may take the actions described in the immediately foregoing
paragraph only after delivering to Parent prior written notice of its intent to take such action. The Company is
required to notify Parent promptly (and no later than one business day) after it obtains (i) knowledge of the receipt by
the Company (or any of its representatives) of any Alternative Proposal, (ii) any inquiry that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, (iii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or its
subsidiaries or (iv) any request for access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company or its
subsidiaries by any third party in connection with an Alternative Proposal. In such notice, the Company must
identify the third party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Alternative Proposal, indication or
request. The Company is also required to keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any
Alternative Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or material proposed amendments as
to price and other material terms thereof.",106,108

Except as permitted by the terms of the Merger Agreement described below, a “Company Adverse Recommendation
Change” means the Board or any applicable committee thereof:
•
failing to make, withdrawing, amending, modifying or materially qualifying, in a manner adverse to Parent,
its unanimous recommendation that the common stockholders of the Company vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement;
•
failing to include the Board’s unanimous recommendation that the common stockholders of the Company
vote to adopt the Merger Agreement a in the Proxy Statement that is mailed to the Company’s common
stockholders;
•
recommending an Alternative Proposal;
•
failing to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for shares of common stock
within 10 business days after the commencement of such offer;
•
making any public statement materially inconsistent with the Board’s unanimous recommendation that the
common stockholders of the Company vote to adopt the Merger Agreement; or
•
resolving or agreeing to take any of the foregoing actions.
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, neither the Board nor any committee thereof may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement or terminate the Merger
Agreement pursuant to the Superior Proposal Termination Provision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the Board (or any committee thereof) may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the Superior Proposal Termination Provision and
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, if:
•
the Company notifies Parent, in writing, at least four business days before making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating the Merger Agreement pursuant to the Superior Proposal
Termination Provision and entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such
action with respect to a Superior Proposal;
•
the Company provides with such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement reflecting the
Superior Proposal and any material documents related thereto, and summarizes in reasonable detail any
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal that are not reflected in the proposed agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal and the identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal;
96TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
during the period of four business days after which the Company provides notice to Parent, the Company
makes its representatives reasonably available, negotiates with Parent in good faith, and causes its
representatives to negotiate with Parent in good faith, to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement so that such Alternative Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes in good faith to make such adjustments (and in the event
that, after commencement of such period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal,
including any revision in price, the Company must provide a new notice to Parent at least three business
days before the Company effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood that
there may be multiple extensions)); and
•
the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor, that such Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking
into account any adjustments made by Parent to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement during
the period after which the Company provides notice to Parent.
As used in this proxy statement, a “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide unsolicited written Alternative Proposal
(except that, for purposes of this definition, each reference in the definition of “Alternative Proposal” to “15%” will
be deemed to be a reference to “50%”) that the Board determines in good faith, (after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors), taking into account all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal (including
conditionality, expected timing and likelihood of consummation of the proposal) (x) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, and (y) is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (after taking into
account any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement committed to in writing by Parent in response to such
Superior Proposal pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement described above).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to certain exceptions set forth above and in the Merger Agreement, prior
to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if:
•
an event, change, effect, development or occurrence, or any consequence thereof that becomes known to
the Board after the date of the Merger Agreement that (i) was not known, (or if known, the consequences
of which were not reasonably foreseeable), to the Board as of or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement
and did not result from a breach of the Merger Agreement by the Company and (ii) does not relate to or
involve an Alternative Proposal (an “Intervening Event”) occurs;
•
the Board (or such committee) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor that the failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
•
prior to effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company promptly notifies Parent,
in writing, at least two business days before taking such action of the Board’s (or such committee’s) intent
to consider such action, and which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the underlying
facts giving rise to the Intervening Event, and the reasons the Board (or such committee) proposes to take,
such action;
•
during such two business day period after the Company provides notice to Parent, the Company
negotiates with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement so that the underlying facts giving rise to the Intervening Event, and the reasons the Board (or
such committee) proposes to take such action, cease to constitute circumstances causing the Board to
propose making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes in
good faith to make such adjustments; and
•
the Board (or such committee) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor and taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during such two business day
period after the Company provides notice to Parent, that the failure to effect such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless the Merger Agreement has been earlier
terminated in accordance with the terms thereof (including by the Company under the Superior Proposal Termination
Provision), the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the Company’s common stockholders at the Special Meeting;
provided, however, that if the Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (i) with respect to a
Superior Proposal, then the Board may recommend approval of such Superior Proposal by the
97
TABLE OF CONTENTS
common stockholders of Company or (ii) based on an Intervening Event, then the Board may submit the Merger
Agreement to Company’s common stockholders without recommendation, in which event the Board will communicate
the basis for its recommendation of such Superior Proposal or the basis for its lack of a recommendation with respect
to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to Company’s common stockholders in the
Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.

Effective as of, and continuing for a period of not less than 12 months following the Closing Date, Parent, the
surviving corporation or one of their respective affiliates will be required to provide or cause each continuing
employee to be provided with (i) base salary or wages that are no less favorable than those provided to such
continuing employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities
that are no less favorable than those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Closing Date,
(iii) if applicable, RSUs and PRSUs, or a cash-based incentive award equivalent thereto, with an aggregate grant date
fair value no less favorable than the aggregate grant date fair value of the RSU and/or PRSUs provided to such
continuing employee in 2021; and (iv) other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, subject to certain exceptions.
With respect to any employee benefit plan, program, practice, policy or arrangement maintained or contributed to by
Parent, the surviving corporation or any of their respective affiliates in which any continuing employee is eligible to
participate on or after the Closing Date, for the purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (but not
for (i) benefit accrual purposes (except for vacation, sick leave, paid time off and severance) or (ii) vesting under any
equity compensation plan, as applicable), such continuing employee’s service with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (or any predecessor entity thereof) prior to the Closing Date will be treated as service with Parent, the
surviving corporation and their respective affiliates to the same extent and for the same purpose as such continuing
employee was entitled, immediately before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under any analogous Company
benefit plan; provided that the foregoing will not apply to the extent that it would result in any duplication of benefits
or compensation.
Parent, the surviving corporation and their respective affiliates will use reasonable best efforts to cause each Parent
welfare benefit plan (i) to waive any and all eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements, evidence of
insurability requirements, pre-existing condition limitations and other exclusions and limitations regarding the
continuing employees and their spouses, domestic partners and dependents to the extent waived, satisfied or not
applicable under the analogous Company benefit plan, and (ii) to recognize for each continuing employee for
purposes of applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such Parent benefit plan
any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such continuing employee and his or her spouse,
domestic partner and dependents under the analogous Company benefit plan during the plan year of such Company
benefit plan in which the Closing Date occurs.

If directed in writing by Parent at least 10 business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its subsidiaries
must terminate (or cause to be terminated) any Company benefit plan (including the Equity Incentive Plans) that can
be legally terminated by the Company or a subsidiary with such termination effective, in the case of any Company
401(k) plan, as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and, in the case of any other Company benefit plan as
of the Closing Date (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter). If a Company 401(k) plan is terminated
pursuant to the above, Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause one or more Parent 401(k) plans to allow each
continuing employee to make a “direct rollover” (including the in-kind rollover of notes evidencing outstanding
participant loans) to the Parent 401(k) plan of all or any portion of the vested account balances of such continuing
employee under the Company 401(k) plan in which each such continuing employee participated prior to the Closing if
such direct rollover is elected in accordance with applicable law by each such continuing employee.",111,112

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting. If common stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special
Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies,
including proxies from common stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against
adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that,
even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement
such that the Merger Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to vote in
favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is
not present.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person
(including by means of remote communication) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the Adjournment
Proposal at the Special Meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our common stockholders with the
opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on certain compensation that will be, or may become, payable to
our named executive officers in connection with the Merger, including the agreements and understandings pursuant
to which such compensation will or may become payable, the estimated value of which is set forth in “The Merger-
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Named Executive Officer Golden Parachute

For purposes of this proxy statement, our named executive officers consist of:
○
Timothy B. Page, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer;

○
Camille G. Cutino, Senior Vice President, Operations and Human Resources.
The Board encourages you to carefully review the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information
disclosed in this proxy statement. As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking common
stockholders to vote on the adoption of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the common stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will
be, or may become, payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, including the
agreements and understandings pursuant to which such compensation will be, or may become, payable, as disclosed
in “The Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Named Executive Officer
Golden Parachute Compensation” in the Company’s proxy statement for the Special Meeting.”
Common stockholders should note that this proposal is separate and apart from the Merger Proposal and is not a
condition to completion of the Merger and, as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on CAI, the Board or
Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to
common stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is
consummated, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise
relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.
Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person
(including by means of remote communication) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the Compensation
Proposal at the Special Meeting.

We have adopted a practice called “householding.” Unless we have received contrary instructions, this practice
allows us to send a single copy of this proxy statement and certain related materials to all common stockholders of
record who share an address. Each common stockholder in the household will continue to receive a separate proxy
card. This process reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household, helps to reduce our
printing costs and mailing expenses and also helps reduce the impact of our stockholder meetings on the
environment.
If you would like to receive your own set of our disclosure documents in connection with the Special Meeting or in
future years, if the Merger is not consummated, please follow the instructions described below. Upon request, we will
promptly deliver a separate copy to you. Similarly, if you share an address with another common stockholder and
together both of you would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents, please follow these
instructions.
If you are a common stockholder of record and would like to receive your own set of our disclosure documents in
connection with the Special Meeting or in future years, if the Merger is not consummated, you may contact us by
writing to CAI International, Inc., Attention: Secretary, Steuart Tower, 1 Market Plaza, Suite 2400, San Francisco,
California 94105, or calling our Secretary at (415) 788-0100. Eligible stockholders of record receiving multiple copies of
this proxy statement can request householding by contacting us in the same manner. If a broker, bank, trustee or
other nominee holds your shares, please contact your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee directly.

The Board of Directors 
CAI International, Inc.
Steuart Tower, 1 Market Plaza, Suite 2400
San Francisco, CA 94105
The Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Shares”) (other Excluded Common Shares, as
defined below), of CAI International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), of the $56.00 per Share in cash,
without interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger proposed to be
entered into (the “Agreement”) by and among Mitsubishi HC Capital, Inc., a Japanese corporation (“Parent”),
Cattleya Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the
Company. The Agreement provides that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger” and,
collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the “Transaction”), as a result of which the
Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each Common Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other Excluded Shares (as defined below)) will be converted into
the right to receive $56.00 per Share in cash, without interest, (the “Common Consideration”). The Agreement further
provides that (x) each share of the Company’s 8.50% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable
Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Shares”), that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than Series A Preferred Shares that are
Excluded Shares) will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the sum of $25.00 plus the aggregate
amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Series A Preferred Share as of the effective time of the Merger, in
cash without interest (the “Series A Preferred Merger Consideration”) and (y) each share of the Company’s 8.50%
Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the
“Series B Preferred Shares” and together with the Series A Preferred Shares, the “Preferred Shares” and together with
the Common Shares, the “Shares”), that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger (other than Series B Preferred Shares that are Excluded Shares) will be converted into the right to receive an
amount equal to the sum of $25.00 plus the aggregate amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Series B
Preferred Share as of the effective time of the Merger, in cash without interest (the “Series B Preferred Merger
Consideration” and together with the Series A Preferred Merger Consideration, the “Preferred Consideration” and
together with the Common Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). As used herein, “Excluded Shares” means,
(a) any Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, (b) any Shares that are Dissenting
Shares (as defined in the Agreement) and (c) any Shares owned by the Company in treasury or by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and “Excluded Common Shares” means Common Shares that are
Excluded Shares, together with Common Shares held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent. The terms and
conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction. We
will receive a fee for our services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the
rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In
addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain
liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement.
We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment
banking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the past two years, we have been engaged to provide
financial advisory services to the Company, including in connection with various strategic matters, and we have
received compensation from the Company for such services. In the past two years, we have not been engaged to
provide financial advisory or other services to Parent or Merger Sub, and we have not received any compensation
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
from Parent during such period. We may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the
Company or Parent or their respective affiliates in the future, for which we may receive compensation. Certain (i) of
our and our affiliates’ directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of our
affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may
have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity
and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or
investments in, the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates or any other party that may be involved in
the Transaction.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things: (i) a draft of the Agreement dated June 17,
2021 (the “Draft Agreement”); (ii) Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the years ended December 31,
2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31. 2018; (iii) certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q of the Company; (iv) certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; (v) certain other
communications from the Company to its stockholders; and (vi) certain internal information relating to the business,
operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the Company, including certain financial forecasts,
analyses and projections relating to the Company prepared by management of the Company and furnished to us by
the Company for purposes of our analysis (the “Forecasts”) (collectively, the “Internal Data”). We have also
participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of the Company regarding
their assessment of the Internal Data. In addition, we reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data,
including valuation multiples, for the Company and compared that data with similar data for certain other companies,
the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that we deemed relevant. We also compared certain of
the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain
other transactions that we deemed relevant and conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into
account such other information as we deemed appropriate.
We have assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of
the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by us
for purposes of this opinion and have, with your consent, relied upon such information as being complete and
accurate. In that regard, we have assumed, at your direction, that the Internal Data (including, without limitation, the
Forecasts) has been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby and we have relied, at your direction, on the
Internal Data for purposes of our analysis and this opinion. We express no view or opinion as to the Internal Data or
the assumptions on which it is based. In addition, at your direction, we have not made any independent evaluation or
appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company,
nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and we have not been asked to conduct, and did
not conduct, a physical inspection of the properties or assets of the Company. We have assumed, at your direction,
that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any respect material to our analysis or this opinion from the Draft
Agreement reviewed by us. We have also assumed, at your direction, that the Transaction will be consummated on
the terms set forth in the Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or
requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the effect
of which would be material to our analysis or this opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary
governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no delay,
limitation, restriction, condition or other change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to our analysis
or this opinion. We have not evaluated and do not express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of the
Company, or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations when they come due, or as to the impact of the
Transaction on such matters, under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting advisors, and we express no opinion as to any legal,
regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
We express no view as to, and our opinion does not address, the Company’s underlying business decision to
proceed with or effect the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative
business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage.
This opinion is limited to and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, to the
holders of the Common Shares (other than Excluded Common Shares) of the Common Consideration to be paid to
such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our
opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or the Transaction, including, without
limitation, the structure or form of the Transaction, or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the
Agreement or entered into in connection with or otherwise contemplated by the Transaction, including, without
limitation, the
B-2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
fairness of the Transaction or any other term or aspect of the Transaction to, or any consideration to be received in
connection therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of the Company or any other party. In addition, we express no view or opinion as to the fairness
(financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to be paid or payable to any
of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any party, or class of such persons in connection with the
Transaction, whether relative to the Common Consideration to be paid to the holder of the Common Shares pursuant
to the Agreement or otherwise. Further, we express no opinion as to the Preferred Consideration, the fairness of the
Common Consideration relative to the Preferred Consideration, or the allocation of the aggregate Merger
Consideration among the holders of Common Shares and Preferred Shares (or any series thereof). Our opinion is
necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, currency, market and other conditions and circumstances as in
effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof, and we do not have any obligation or
responsibility to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring
after the date hereof. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company or any
other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the Merger or otherwise act
with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.
Our financial advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of
the Board of Directors of the Company (in their capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection
with and for purposes of its consideration of the Transaction. The issuance of this opinion was approved by the
Centerview Partners LLC Fairness Opinion Committee.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, and qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that the
Common Consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Shares (other than Excluded Common Shares) pursuant
to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Very truly yours,

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
Appraisal rights.
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand
pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and
who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of
this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of
stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word
“stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include
what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument
issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a
corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a
merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this
title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:
(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the
stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately prior to the execution of the
agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than
2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the
stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

"CAI International, Inc._20210804_DEFM14A_19444962_4270736.Pdf",Payment.,"Payment.
(a) Paying Agent. Not fewer than three Business Days before the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) select a bank or
trust company, satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable discretion, to act as the paying agent for the
payment of the amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (the “Paying Agent”) and (ii) enter into a paying
agent agreement with the Paying Agent on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the Company in its
reasonable discretion (the “Paying Agent Agreement”). Parent shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of
the Paying Agent.
(b) Payment Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Paying Agent an amount, in cash, sufficient to make all payments pursuant to this Article III (such amount, the
“Payment Fund”). If a Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its, appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall make available or cause
to be made available to the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of
Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its, appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the applicable Merger Consideration for such Dissenting
Shares. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent provided that such investments
shall be (A) in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, (B) in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC,
respectively, (C) in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000 or (D) in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Payment Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the aggregate amounts payable under this Article III shall be promptly returned to Parent (or its
designee). To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Payment Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under
this Article III, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Paying Agent to make such aggregate payments under this Article III.
(c) Payment Procedures.
(i) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day following
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, of Shares that have converted pursuant to Section 3.1(a) into the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto a letter of transmittal in customary form containing
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (the “Letter of Transmittal”). The Letter of
Transmittal shall specify that delivery of Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon (x) in the case of certificated Shares, proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and (y) in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, reasonable and customary provisions regarding delivery of an “agent’s
message” with respect to such Book-Entry Shares.
(ii) In the case of certificated Shares, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate representing
any such Shares that have been converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1(a), together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to the record holder of such
Certificate a check or wire transfer for the amount of applicable Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled.
(iii) With respect to Book-Entry Shares, upon receipt by Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) with respect to any Book-
Entry Shares representing any Shares that have been converted in the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to the record
holder
A-12TABLE OF CONTENTS
of such Book-Entry Shares a check or wire transfer for the amount of Merger Consideration that such
record holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement in respect of such Book-
Entry Shares, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled.
(iv) No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, or if payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or the Paying Agent that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
(v) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event, not later than the first Business Day after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation an amount, in cash, sufficient
to make all payments pursuant to Section 3.3, and Parent shall cause, promptly after the receipt of such
payment by the Surviving Corporation, and in any event no later than ten Business Days following the
Closing Date, each Option Holder and RSU Holder to be paid through a payroll or other appropriate
account of the Surviving Corporation or any its Affiliates the amounts provided for in Section 3.3, subject
to deductions of any applicable withholding Tax in accordance with Section 3.2(h).
(d) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to Shares and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of any Shares. If,
after the Effective Time, any Person presents to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Paying Agent any
Certificates for transfer or any transfer instructions relating to Shares canceled in the Merger, such Person shall
be given a copy of the Letter of Transmittal and directed to comply with the instructions in that letter of
transmittal in order to receive any cash to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this Article III.
(e) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the record holders of Shares as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation (or its designee). Any record holder of Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Excluded Shares) who has not complied with this Article III prior to the date that is 12 months
after the Effective Time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws) only as a general creditor thereof for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration for
such Shares upon compliance with the instructions in the Letter of Transmittal, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any record holder
of Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. All cash paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates.
(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated under this Article III.
(g) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Shares which are held
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger
(or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares
(the “Dissenting Shares”) pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL (the “Dissenting Stockholders”), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled only to such rights as
A-13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
are accorded under Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost its right to appraisal under the
DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, such holder’s Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into the right to receive, as
of the Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with Section 3.1,
without interest and subject to deductions of any applicable withholding Tax in accordance with Section 3.2(h).
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demand for appraisal or attempted withdrawal of such
demand that is received by the Company relating to Company stockholders’ rights of appraisal. Parent shall
have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all demands for appraisal by Company
stockholders under the DGCL. Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall not
voluntarily offer to make, or otherwise negotiate or make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal
without the prior written consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
(h) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled, without duplication, to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), or any other applicable state, local or non-U.S.
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be (i) timely remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) to
the extent remitted pursuant to the foregoing subsection (i), treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or a committee thereof shall take such actions as are
necessary to cause (i) the performance conditions of each PRSU to be deemed satisfied at 100% of the relevant
target level of achievement (notwithstanding any contrary provision in any agreement or document governing
or evidencing the relevant PRSU) and (ii) each Option, PRSU, RSU and share of Restricted Stock to become fully
vested and free of any applicable forfeiture restrictions, in each of clauses (i) and (ii), effective as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.
(b) In-the-Money Company Options. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Option Holder, each Option that
has a per share exercise price that is less than the Common Merger Consideration, shall not be assumed by
Parent and shall instead be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by Parent of an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Option
multiplied by (y) the excess of the Common Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of
the Option. As of the Effective Time, each Option Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the foregoing consideration. All payments under this Section 3.3(b) shall be made at
or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, pursuant to the Company’s or the Surviving
Corporation’s ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.
(c) Out-of-the-Money Company Options. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Option Holder, each
Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Common Merger Consideration
shall to the extent not exercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled at the
Effective Time with no payment made therefor and shall cease to represent a right to purchase shares of
Common Stock.
(d) RSUs and PRSUs. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any RSU Holder, each RSU and PRSU shall not be
assumed by Parent and shall be cancelled and automatically converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Common Merger Consideration in cash, without interest, for each share of Common Stock subject to
the RSU or PRSU. As of the Effective Time, each RSU Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
A-14TABLE OF CONTENTS
thereto, except to receive the foregoing consideration. All payments under this Section 3.3(d) shall be made at or
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, pursuant to the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s
ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.
(e) Company ESPP. Simultaneously in connection with the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall: (i)
cause any offering period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased) in progress under the
Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement to be the final offering period under the Company ESPP and to
be terminated as of the date of this Agreement (the “Final Exercise Date”); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments
that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes
under the Company ESPP; and (iii) cause each participant’s then-outstanding share purchase right under the
Company ESPP (the “Company ESPP Rights”) to terminate as of the Final Exercise Date. Thereafter, the
Company shall terminate the Company ESPP no later than the Effective Time. On the Final Exercise Date, to the
extent sufficient funds have been credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within the associated
accumulated payroll withholding accounts for participants to fund a share purchase for a reasonable number of
shares, then such funds shall be used to purchase shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP, and otherwise the current offering period shall terminate without a final purchase. Each share
purchased thereunder prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive the Common Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a), subject to withholding of
any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant
under the Company ESPP following the Final Exercise Date shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP (as amended pursuant to this Section 3.3(e)), be
refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Final Exercise Date (without interest). No
further Company ESPP Rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP after the Final Exercise
Date.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in no event later than fifteen
(15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement), the Company shall, in consultation with Parent,
prepare and file with the SEC in preliminary form a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the “Proxy Statement”) relating to the meeting of the Company’s stockholders held for the
purpose of approving and adopting this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the “Company Stockholders Meeting”). Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating
to it required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, and such information, at the date the
Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company’s stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
A-35TABLE OF CONTENTS
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
respond to all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after
receipt thereof and file all necessary amendments thereto in connection with such SEC comments. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for any
amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall consult with Parent regarding, and
provide Parent with copies of, all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response and the Company shall in good faith consider
including all such comments proposed by Parent, but the Company shall not be obligated to incorporate any
such comments. The Company shall, after the date on which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it
has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Record Holders
entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and shall cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to
be held as soon as reasonably practicable following such mailing (but in no event more than 45 days after the
date of such mailing).
(b) The Proxy Statement, at the date it is first mailed to the Company’s stockholders, or at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not false or
misleading in light of the circumstances under which they are made. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any obligations of the Company with respect to this Section 6.2(b) do not
extend to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.
(c) If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent (as applicable), should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information promptly shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

as reasonably practicable following confirmation by the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) that it has no further comments
on the Proxy Statement take all action necessary to set a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (b) subject to Section 6.4, include in the Proxy Statement the Company
Board Recommendation and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. As soon
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and thereafter, upon the reasonable request of Parent
made not more than one time every week), the Company shall conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-
13 of the Exchange Act for a record date for the Company Stockholders’ Meeting that is twenty (20) business days
after the date of such “broker search.” Unless the Agreement has been duly terminated in accordance with the terms
herein, the Company shall, subject to the right of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to modify its
recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent under the circumstances specified in Section 6.4, use commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from the stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger and the Transactions and to secure the Company Stockholder Approval (it being
understood that the foregoing shall not require the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to recommend in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement, if a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has been effected in accordance
with Section 6.4(d)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may not
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as required by applicable Law, (ii) if the Company
reasonably believes in good faith that it is necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment
A-36TABLE OF CONTENTS
to the Proxy Statement that is legally required or may be advisable (including in the event that, and respect of, any
objection that is raised by any stockholder of the Company to the sufficiency or accuracy of the Proxy Statement) is
timely provided to the stockholders of the Company, or (iii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of the Common
Stock (either in person, or by means of remote communication, or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or if on the date of such Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of the Common Stock
necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by (and solely pursuant to the terms of) Section
6.4), the Company shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
stockholders relating to the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, that unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
the Company Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 10 days after the
date for which the then most-recent Company Stockholders Meeting was scheduled (excluding any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Law). The Company agrees that no matters shall be brought before the
Company Stockholders Meeting other than the proposal to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, the related
“golden parachute” vote under Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act and any related and customary procedural matters
(including a proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval). The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and proxy tallies following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to
the holders of the Shares; provided, that the Company shall, upon the request of Parent, use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the applicable proxy solicitor of the Company to advise Parent on a not less than daily basis during
the last ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of
the proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval.

Company or any Company Subsidiary to, or knowingly assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate, or knowingly
encourage any effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, any Alternative Proposal; (ii)
except where the Company Board (or a committee thereof) makes a good faith determination, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries; or (iii)
enter into any agreement, letter of intent, term sheet or other Contract relating to any Alternative Proposal (each,

Approval, the Company Board (or a committee thereof), directly or indirectly through any Representative, may,
subject to Section 6.4(c): (i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party, that has made (and
not withdrawn) a bona fide Alternative Proposal in writing that was not solicited in violation of Section 6.4(a)

A-37TABLE OF CONTENTS
(ii) enter into, and thereafter furnish to such third party non-public information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries pursuant to, an executed confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of such third party non-public information (to the extent such non-public
information has not been previously made available by the Company to Parent) and such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement shall be provided to Parent substantially contemporaneously); (iii) following receipt
of and on account of a Superior Proposal, and subject to Section 6.4(d) and Section 6.4(f), make a Company

Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or in violation of any Order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall
prevent the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position
under Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Alternative Proposal,
if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law; provided, that, any such
disclosure that would otherwise constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall only be made in
accordance with Section 6.4(d) or Section 6.4(e), as applicable.
(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i)
through (iv) of Section 6.4(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising
Parent that it intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in no event later than
one Business Day) after it obtains (i) knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives)
of any Alternative Proposal, (ii) any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative
Proposal, (iii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries by
any third party in connection with an Alternative Proposal. In such notice, the Company shall identify the third
party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such Alternative
Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or material proposed amendments as to price

Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) and enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement, if: (i) the Company notifies Parent, in writing, at least four Business
Days (the “Superior Proposal Notice Period”) before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) and entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement, of
its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice shall state expressly that the Company has
received an Alternative Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith,
after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) the
Company attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement reflecting the Superior
Proposal and any material documents related thereto, and summarizes in reasonable detail any material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal that are not reflected in the proposed agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal; (iii) during the Superior
Proposal Notice Period, the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith, and causes its Representatives to
negotiate with Parent in good faith, to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
that such Alternative Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes in
good faith to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Superior
Proposal Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including any revision
in price, the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three
Business Days remain in the Superior Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time

the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision); and (iv) the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such
Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments
made by Parent during the Superior Proposal Notice Period to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.4(a)-(d), but subject to Section 6.4 and the last
sentence of this Section 6.4(e), prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if: (i) an Intervening Event
occurs, (ii) the Company Board (or such committee) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor that the failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iii) prior to effecting the Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least two Business
Days (the “Company Adverse Recommendation Notice Period”) before taking such action of the Company
Board’s (or such committee’s) intent to consider such action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change), and which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description
of the underlying facts giving rise to the Intervening Event, and the reasons the Company Board (or such
committee) proposes to take such action; (iv) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during
the Company Adverse Recommendation Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the underlying facts giving rise to the
Intervening Event, and the reasons the Company Board (or such committee) proposes to take such action, cease
to constitute circumstances causing the Company Board to propose making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes in good faith to make such adjustments; and (v)
the Company Board (or such committee) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor and taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Company Adverse
Recommendation Notice Period, that the failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and hereby
agrees that any Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected (or proposed to be effected) in response
to or in connection with any Alternative Proposal may be made solely and exclusively pursuant to Section 6.4(d)
only, and may not be made pursuant to this Section 6.4(e), and any Company Adverse Recommendation Change

consequence thereof, that becomes known to the Company Board after the date of this Agreement that (i) was

as of or prior to the date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this Agreement by the Company
and (ii) does not relate to or involve an Alternative Proposal.

terminated in accordance with Article VIII (including by the Company under Section 8.3(a)), this Agreement
shall be submitted to Company’s shareholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting

respective reasonable best efforts to reasonably promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to
consummate, and make effective as reasonably promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Transactions,
including (i) preparing and filing with a Governmental Authority as reasonably promptly as practicable all

to obtain as reasonably promptly as practicable all Consents necessary to be obtained from any Governmental

reasonably promptly as practicable taking all steps as may be commercially reasonable to obtain all such
Governmental Approvals and (iii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals and consents from, and providing all
notices to, any other third party that are necessary to consummate the Transactions (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, those required to maintain in effect after the Closing all Contracts relating to the Company’s
Indebtedness without any default thereunder), including those set forth on Schedule 6.5. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate and complete filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within fifteen (15)
Business Days of the date of this Agreement and, unless otherwise agreed by the parties; (B) make all other
filings that are required to be made in order to consummate the Transactions pursuant to other Regulatory Laws
with respect to the Transactions, including without limitation, any such filings required pursuant to the

States, in each case pertaining to pre-merger notification and regulation of terms and conditions of merger
transactions, as reasonably promptly as practicable; and (C) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act,

Regulatory Law as soon as practicable (including complying with any “second request” for information or
similar request from a Governmental Authority pursuant to other Regulatory Laws). The foregoing
notwithstanding, to the extent there is a conflict between this Section 6.5 and Section 6.17 with respect to
actions to be taken in connection with the Migration, Section 6.17 shall control and govern.

any of the Transactions; (iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with the FTC, the

each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be provided
to the other under this Section 6.5(b) as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed
by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Section 6.5(a) and
Section 6.5(b), Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in any court with respect to the Transactions by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
applicable Governmental Authority.

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) Parent shall not be required to, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to (and shall not without the consent of Parent), take any actions
which would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (each such condition and
action described in clause (A) (as it relates to Parent) and clause (B) (as it relates to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) that the applicable party hereto is not required to accept or take, a “Burdensome
Condition”). Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any Governmental Authority consistent with its
obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is agreed that Parent shall
make all strategic decisions and lead all discussions, negotiations and other proceedings, and coordinate all
activities with respect to any requests that may be made by, or any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals,
or waivers that may be sought by or from, any Governmental Authority, in connection with obtaining
Governmental Approvals for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Laws, including
determining the strategy for contesting, litigating or otherwise responding to objections to, or proceedings
challenging, the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, in each case subject to good faith

the condition which has failed or will fail to be satisfied; (ii) any written notice from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions to the extent such consent is
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (iii) any material written notice
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions; provided that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.5(d) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent or
the Company.

applicable Law, the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and
any person who becomes an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the

A-42TABLE OF CONTENTS

Surviving Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement in the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws.
(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall obtain, and fully pay the premium for, a non-
cancelable extension of the Company’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and fiduciary liability

Company’s D&O Insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof; provided that if the aggregate cost for such
insurance coverage in respect of any one policy year exceeds 300% of the current annual premium paid by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall instead be obligated to obtain D&O Insurance with the best available
coverage with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate cost in respect of
each policy year within such six-year period of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company.

acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the

force and effect in accordance with their terms.

Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.10.

expressly intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs
and his or her legal representatives and are a contract right of each Indemnified Person as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and those rights to indemnification and insurance shall exist in addition to and
without limiting any and all rights to indemnification granted or arising under the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws or the Surviving Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or by operation of law.

value of the RSU and/or PRSUs provided to such Continuing Employee in 2021; and (iv) other employee

contributed to by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates in which any Continuing

of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for (i) benefit accrual purposes (except for vacation,
sick leave, paid time off and severance) or (ii) vesting under any equity compensation plan, as applicable), such
Continuing Employee’s service with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (or any predecessor
entity thereof) prior to the Closing Date shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Affiliates to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, immediately before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under any analogous Company Benefit
Plan; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that it would result in any duplication of benefits
or compensation.

each Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) to waive
any and all eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements, evidence of insurability requirements, pre-
existing condition limitations and other exclusions and limitations regarding the Continuing Employees and their
spouses, domestic partners and dependents to the extent waived, satisfied or not applicable under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) to recognize for each Continuing Employee for purposes of applying
annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such Parent Benefit Plan any deductible, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing Employee and his or her spouse, domestic
partner and dependents under the analogous Company Benefit Plan during the plan year of such Company
Benefit Plan in which the Closing Date occurs.

Company Subsidiaries shall terminate (or cause to be terminated) any Company Benefit Plan (including the
Equity Incentive Plans) that can be legally terminated by the Company or a Company Subsidiary with such
termination effective, in the case of any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify as a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a “Company 401(k) Plan”), as of the day

applicable Company Benefit Plans have been timely terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board
and, as applicable, any Company Subsidiary. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the
prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
If a Company 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to this Section 6.11(d), Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause one or more defined contribution plans maintained by Parent or its Affiliates that include a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (as applicable, the “Parent 401(k)
Plan”) to allow each Continuing Employee to make a “direct rollover” (as described in Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code and including the in-kind rollover of notes evidencing outstanding participant loans) to the Parent 401(k)
Plan of all or any portion of the vested account balances of such Continuing Employee under the Company
401(k) Plan in which each such Continuing Employee participated prior to the Closing if such direct rollover is
elected in accordance with applicable Law by each such Continuing Employee.

prevent the amendment, modification, or termination of any agreement with a Continuing Employee after the
Effective Time; or (iii) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement or otherwise be treated as an adoption
of, or amendment or modification of, any Company Benefit Plan, any benefit plan of Parent or any of its

the Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
parties acknowledge and hereby agree that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with

parties hereto further agree that nothing set forth in this Section 9.10 shall require any party hereto to institute
