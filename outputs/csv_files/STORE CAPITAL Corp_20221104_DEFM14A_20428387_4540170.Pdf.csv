The Proposals
The special meeting of our stockholders will be held on December 9, 2022 at 8:00 a.m., Arizona time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access
the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/STOR2022SM. At the special meeting, holders of our
common stock, par
 
2Table of Contents
value $0.01 per share (“common stock”), will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the merger (the “merger proposal”), (2) a
proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that
is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the “advisory compensation proposal”), and (3) a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special
meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal (the
“adjournment proposal”).
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on October 24, 2022, are entitled to receive
notice of and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to
cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the
record date, there were 282,685,797 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence virtually via the special meeting website or by proxy of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to
be cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special
meeting. Virtual attendance at the special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the special meeting. Abstentions will be
counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect
that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later date (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement).
Required Vote
Completion of the merger requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting (the “stockholder approval”). Because the required vote
for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you abstain
from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee
on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these proposals,
if you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or
other nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is
present).
Proxies and Revocation
Any holder of record of our common stock entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of common stock by returning
the enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or by attending the virtual special meeting
and voting during the live webcast. If the shares of our common stock that you own are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee,
you should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other
nominee.

Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by your delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy card, by authorizing your
proxy by telephone or through the Internet at a later date than your previously authorized proxy, by your filing a written revocation of your proxy
with our Corporate Secretary or by your voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting alone will not be sufficient to
revoke a previously authorized proxy.

Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.
Pursuant to an engagement letter, dated July 27, 2022, we engaged Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) to act as our financial advisor in
connection with the merger. At a meeting of our board of directors held on September 14, 2022, Evercore rendered to our board of directors its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated September 14, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and
based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s written opinion, the merger
consideration of $32.25 per share to be received by holders of shares of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective
affiliates) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated September 14, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as

Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of,
 
4Table of Contents
our board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the merger and addresses only the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of shares of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their
respective affiliates) in the merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to our board of directors or to any other persons in respect
of the merger, including as to how any holder of our common stock should vote or act in respect of the merger. Evercore’s opinion does not address
the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address
the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger.
Pursuant to the terms of our engagement letter with Evercore, we have agreed to pay Evercore an aggregate transaction fee that is estimated,
based on the information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $31 million, of which $3 million was payable upon delivery of
Evercore’s opinion, and the balance of which will become payable upon the consummation of the merger.
For further information, see the section entitled “The Merger—Opinions of Our Financial Advisors—Opinion of Evercore” and Exhibit B to
this proxy statement.
Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Pursuant to an engagement letter, dated July 27, 2022, we engaged Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) to act as our financial
advisor in connection with the merger. At a meeting of our board of directors held on September 14, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered to our board of
directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated September 15, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of
Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $32.25
in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated September 15, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with Goldman Sachs’ opinion, is attached as
Exhibit C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion contained in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and opinion
were provided for the information and assistance of our board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger and the opinion does
not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of our common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.
Pursuant to the terms of our engagement letter with Goldman Sachs, we have agreed to pay Goldman Sachs an aggregate transaction fee that
is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $31 million, of which $28 million is contingent

Common Stock
The merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the merger effective time (other than shares of common stock held by the
 
5Table of Contents
Company, the Parent Parties or any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “excluded stock”)) will be automatically cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $32.25 per share of common stock (the “merger consideration”), without interest.
Each share of excluded stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and no consideration will be paid, nor will any right inure or be made with respect thereto in connection with or as a consequence of the
merger. If we declare and pay a dividend to holders of shares of our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid
the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the merger consideration will be
decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend.
Restricted Stock
The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding award of restricted shares of
our common stock (“restricted stock”) granted pursuant to the Company’s 2015 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (including any amendments, the
“Equity Incentive Plan”) will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and repurchase rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares
of our common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and subject to the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration, less required withholding taxes.
Performance Units
The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, outstanding awards of performance-based
restricted share units with respect to shares of our common stock (“performance units”) granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan will
automatically become earned and vested, as further described below under the sections entitled “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” and “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits,” and thereafter will be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled vested performance units will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive as
of the merger effective time, in consideration for the cancellation of such vested performance unit and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal
to the product of (1) the merger consideration and (2) the number of so-determined earned performance shares subject to such vested performance
units, without interest, less required withholding taxes. In addition, on the closing date, we will pay each holder of performance units an amount
equivalent to all cash dividends that would have been paid on the number of so-determined earned shares of our common stock subject to such
performance units as if they had been issued and outstanding from the date of grant up to, and including, the merger effective time, less required
withholding taxes.",11,12

Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the merger, Parent expects to assume the non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes
outstanding under our STORE Master Funding debt program and the outstanding indebtedness under our public unsecured notes. Parent has also
informed us that it expects the outstanding indebtedness under our traditional non-recourse mortgage notes, unsecured revolving credit facility,
private placement unsecured notes and unsecured bank term loans to be prepaid or remain outstanding. As of September 30, 2022, we had
approximately $2.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of consolidated secured indebtedness outstanding, including approximately $2.1 billion in
non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes and approximately $141.8 million in non-recourse mortgage notes. As of September 30, 2022, we had
approximately $2.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of consolidated unsecured indebtedness outstanding, including $223 million under our
unsecured revolving credit facility, $1.8 billion under our unsecured notes and $600 million under our unsecured bank term loans.

We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will
be approximately $10.8 billion. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the following: (1) cash equity investments by an
affiliate of GIC and by Oak Street in an aggregate amount of approximately $8.2 billion (the “equity financing”); and (2) debt financing in an
aggregate principal amount of $2.6 billion (the “debt financing”). For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger—Financing of the
Merger” and “The Merger Agreement—Financing.”
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition to the closing of the merger. We have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to
provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and customary
in connection with the arrangement of debt financing, the assumption of indebtedness and other transactions. For more information, see the

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on October 15, 2022 (the “no-shop period

(including non-public information and data), and affording access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of us and our
subsidiaries to any person (and its representatives, including potential financing sources) pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement (as
defined in the merger agreement); provided, that we provided to Parent and Merger Sub (and their representatives, including financing sources) any
non-public information or data that was provided to any person given such access that was not previously made available to Parent and Merger Sub
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it was provided to such person (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter) and engage in any
discussions or negotiations with any persons (and their respective representatives, including potential financing sources) with respect to an
acquisition proposal (as defined below) or potential acquisition proposal or interest or potential interest with respect thereto, or otherwise cooperate
with, assist or participate in, or facilitate any acquisition inquiries. Within one business day after the no-shop period start date, we were required to
notify Parent in writing of the identity of each person from whom we received an acquisition proposal during such period and provide to Parent a list
identifying each excluded party (as defined below) as of the no-shop period start date and an unredacted copy of any acquisition proposal made in
writing and a written summary of the material terms and conditions of any acquisition proposal not made in writing.
For purposes of the merger agreement:
 
•
“Acquisition inquiry” means an inquiry, indication of interest or request for information or discussions from a third party that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal.
 
7Table of Contents
•
“Acquisition proposal” means any proposal or offer from any third party relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions: (1) any direct or indirect acquisition or issuance (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of 20% or more of any
class of our equity interests (by vote or by value) by any third party; (2) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
reorganization, share exchange, sale of assets, recapitalization, equity investment, joint venture, liquidation, dissolution or other
transaction that would result in any third party acquiring assets (including capital stock of or interest in any of our subsidiaries or
affiliates) representing, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the consolidated assets of us or our subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as
determined on a fair market value basis (including Indebtedness secured solely by such assets)); (3) the acquisition (whether by
merger, consolidation, equity investment, share exchange, joint venture or otherwise) by any third party, directly or indirectly, of any
class of equity interest in any entity that holds assets representing, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the consolidated assets of us
or our subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as determined on a book value basis (including indebtedness secured solely by such assets)); (4)
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture, recapitalization, reorganization, sale or purchase or
other similar transaction involving us, or any tender offer or exchange offer, as such terms are defined under the Exchange Act, that, if
consummated, would result in any third party beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock (or any
class of our voting securities); (5) any other transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any third party proposes to
acquire control of assets of us or our subsidiaries having a fair market value equal to or greater than 20% of the fair market value of all
of the assets of us or our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction; or (6) any combination of the foregoing.
 
•
“Excluded party” means a person or group of persons from whom we or any of our representatives have received a bona fide written
acquisition proposal after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the no-shop period start date, which written acquisition
proposal our board of directors has determined in good faith prior to the no-shop period start date (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (a “qualified
proposal”).
The “No-Shop” Period: No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals
Under the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the no-shop period start date, except as permitted for any excluded party (for so long
as such person or group is an excluded party) or as permitted pursuant to certain exceptions, we have agreed that, among other things, we will cease
any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or communications with any person that may be ongoing with respect to any acquisition proposal and
will not solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the submission or announcement or any acquisition proposal or acquisition
inquiry, furnish any non-public information regarding us or our subsidiaries to any third party with respect to any acquisition proposal or
acquisition inquiry, engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party with respect to any acquisition
proposal or acquisition inquiry or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an acquisition proposal or acquisition inquiry.
However, we may, on or after the no-shop period start date and prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, engage in, enter into or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with, and furnish non-public information to, a third party which has made an acquisition proposal if our
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
acquisition proposal (if consummated in accordance with its terms) either constitutes superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
superior proposal.
Prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, our board of directors may, in certain circumstances, effect a change in recommendation (as
defined under “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals and Obligations

agreement are “covered transactions” and subject to review under the Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C.
§4565), and all rules and regulations issued and effective thereunder (the “DPA”), (2) CFIUS has issued a written notice that it has completed a
review or investigation of the notification voluntarily provided pursuant to the DPA with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and has concluded all action under the DPA, or (3) CFIUS has sent a report to the President of the United States (the “President”)
requesting the President’s decision, and (a) the President has announced a decision not to take any action to suspend or prohibit the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or (b) having received a report from CFIUS requesting the President’s decision, the President has not taken
any action after 15 days from the earlier of the date the President received such report from CFIUS or the end of the investigation period.

We and Parent may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time prior to the closing of the merger,
even after we have obtained the stockholder approval.
Termination by Either the Company or Parent
In addition, we, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, may terminate the merger agreement, upon prior written notice to the other
party, at any time prior to the closing of the merger, if:

failure of the merger to be consummated by the end date;
 
•
even after we have obtained the stockholder approval, any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final and non-
appealable order or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided, that the right to terminate the merger agreement under this bullet is not
available to any party to the merger agreement if the issuance of such final, non-appealable order was primarily due to the failure of
such party (and, in the case of Parent, including the failure of the other Parent Parties) to perform in all material respects any of its
obligations, covenants or agreements under the merger agreement; or
 
•
the stockholder approval has not been obtained upon a vote taken at the special meeting (or any postponement or adjournment

conditions to the parties’ obligations to effect the merger or the additional conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
effect the merger not to be satisfied, which breach or failure to perform cannot be cured, or if capable of cure, has not been cured by the
earlier of 30 days following written notice thereof from Parent to us and two business days prior to the end date; provided, that Parent
will not have the right to terminate the merger agreement under this bullet if, at the time Parent delivers notice of its election to terminate
the merger agreement, Parent or Merger Sub has breached any of their representations or warranties or failed to perform any obligation
set forth in the merger agreement, in each case, that would cause any of the closing conditions relating to their representations,
warranties or obligations not to be satisfied, subject to the same cure period described above in this bullet; or
 
•
(1) prior to receipt of the stockholder approval, our board of directors has effected a change in recommendation in accordance with the

following written notice thereof from us to Parent and two business days prior to the end date; provided, however, that we will not
have the right to terminate the merger agreement under this bullet if, at the time we deliver notice of our election to terminate the merger
agreement, we have breached any of our representations or warranties or failed to perform any obligation set forth in the merger
agreement, in each case, that would cause any of the closing conditions relating to our representations, warranties or obligations not to
be satisfied, subject to the same cure period described above in this bullet;
 
•
prior to receipt of the stockholder approval, our board of directors has effected a change in recommendation in respect of a superior
proposal, in respect of which we complied in all respects with certain obligations under the merger agreement (other than any such non-
compliance that was immaterial and unintentional) and our board of directors has approved, and concurrently with termination of the
merger agreement, we enter into, a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such superior proposal, but only if we are

waived by Parent;

notified Parent in writing that all of the conditions to the parties’ obligations to effect the merger or, with respect to our

willing and able to consummate the merger; and
 
•

stood ready, willing and able to effect the closing of the merger through the end of such three-business day period.

Company Termination Fee
We have agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of $274 million (the “Company termination fee”), if:
 
•
Parent terminates the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in the second bullet in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by Parent”;
 
•
we terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in the second bullet in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by the Company”; or
 
•
all of the following requirements are satisfied:
 
•
we or Parent terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the provisions described in the first bullet (and at the time of such
termination we would not have been entitled to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in the third
bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by the Company”) or
the third bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by Either
the Company or Parent” or Parent terminates the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in the first bullet in the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination by Parent”; and
 
•
(1) an acquisition proposal has been received by us or our representatives or any person has publicly proposed or publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an acquisition proposal (and, in the case of a termination pursuant
to the provision described in the third bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger
Agreement—Termination by Either the Company or Parent,” such acquisition proposal or publicly proposed or announced
intention was made prior to the special meeting) and (2) within 12 months after the date of the termination referred to in the
immediately preceding sub-bullet, we enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of any acquisition
proposal, or any acquisition proposal is consummated (provided, that for purposes of this sub-bullet, each reference to “20% or
more” in the definition of “acquisition proposal” will be deemed to be references to “more than 50%”).
However, the Company termination fee would have equaled $137 million in the event that the merger agreement had been terminated by us
pursuant to the provisions described in the second bullet point under “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—
Termination by the Company” prior to the cut-off time (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals and
Obligations of the Board of Directors with Respect to its Recommendation—The “Go-Shop” Period: Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”) in order
to enter into a definitive agreement with an excluded party providing for the implementation of a superior proposal.
Parent Termination Fee
Parent has agreed to pay to us a termination fee of $503 million (the “Parent termination fee”) if we terminate the merger agreement pursuant to
the provisions described in the first bullet or third bullet in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—
Termination by the Company.”

The parties to the merger agreement have agreed that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of the merger
agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that each party will be entitled, prior to the
valid termination of the merger agreement, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of the merger agreement (other than the Parent Parties’ obligation to effect the closing, which is governed by the next
sentence) , without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to which they are entitled under certain provisions of
the merger agreement. The parties to the merger agreement have further agreed that, prior to the valid termination of the merger agreement and any
dispute over the right to termination having been finally resolved, we will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy
to specifically enforce the Parent Parties’ obligation to effect the closing on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement in the event
that (1) the mutual conditions to the parties’ obligations to effect the merger and the additional conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to effect the merger (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing; provided, that each such condition is
then capable of being satisfied at the closing) have been satisfied or waived, (2) the debt financing is available to be funded or will be funded or will
be funded if the equity financing is funded, in each case in accordance with the terms of the debt commitment letter, (3) Parent has failed to
consummate the closing at the time when it was required under the merger agreement, and (4) we have irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that
if specific performance were granted and the debt financing and equity financing were funded, then the closing would occur in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement.

Unless Parent agrees otherwise, the merger will not be completed until the parties have obtained the CFIUS approval. We are unaware of any
other material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required for the execution of the merger agreement or the
completion of the merger, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the
State of Maryland, and the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

We are organized as a corporation under Maryland law. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law (“MGCL”), because shares of our
common stock were listed on the NYSE on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting, our
stockholders who object to the merger do not have any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection
with the merger. In addition, holders of our common stock may not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting
stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by the MGCL, our charter
provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such rights unless our board of directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the board,
determines that the rights apply. Our board of directors has made no such determination. However, our stockholders can vote against the merger
proposal.

As of November 3, 2022, three lawsuits have been filed by purported stockholders of the Company in connection with the merger. The
complaints generally allege, among other things, that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company in connection with the merger fails to
disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs
in each pending lawsuit seek, among other things, an injunction barring the merger or, in the alternative, rescission of the merger to the extent it is
already implemented, and an award of damages.

Although the ultimate outcome of the matters cannot be predicted with any certainty, we believe that each of these lawsuits is without merit.
Additional lawsuits arising out of the merger may also be filed in the future. See “The Merger—Litigation Related to the Merger” for more

The receipt of the merger consideration for each share of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the
difference, if any, between the merger consideration you receive and your adjusted tax basis in your shares. In addition, under certain circumstances,
we may be required to withhold a portion of your merger consideration under applicable tax laws, including, in the case of non-U.S. holders,
pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the
merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. We encourage you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the

The following questions and answers briefly address some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the proposed merger. These
questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by reference, including the
merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A.
 
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
 
A:
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company and its subsidiaries by affiliates of the Sponsors pursuant to the merger agreement.
Once we have obtained the stockholder approval and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, at
the merger effective time, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the Surviving Entity. For additional
information about the merger, please review the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document governing the
merger.
 
Q:
As a holder of common stock, what will I receive in the merger?
 
A:
For each outstanding share of common stock that you own immediately prior to the merger effective time, you will receive $32.25 in cash, without
interest.
 
Q:
Will I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the common stock that I own?
 
A:
On September 19, 2022, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share of common stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2022,
which was paid on October 17, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 30, 2022. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, we may not declare, set aside or pay any other dividends or distributions to the holders of our common stock during the term of the
merger agreement, other than dividends or distributions required for us to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the incurrence
of any income or excise taxes (which will result in a reduction of the merger consideration as described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Treatment of Common Stock, Restricted Stock and Performance Units—Common Stock”).
 
Q:
What will happen to my shares of restricted stock and performance units?
 
A:
Restricted Stock. Effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding award of restricted stock granted pursuant to the Equity
Incentive Plan will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and repurchase rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of our
common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the merger consideration, less required withholding taxes.
Performance Units. Effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, outstanding awards of performance units granted pursuant to the
Equity Incentive Plan will automatically become earned and vested, as further described below under the sections entitled “The Merger—Interests
of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” and “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits,” and thereafter will be cancelled
and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled vested performance units will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive as of the merger effective time, in consideration for the cancellation of such vested performance unit and in settlement therefor, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the merger consideration and (2) the number of so-determined earned performance shares subject to
such vested performance units, without interest, less required withholding taxes. In addition, on the closing date, we will pay each holder of
performance units an amount equivalent to all cash dividends that would have been paid on the number of so-determined earned shares of
 
15Table of Contents
our common stock subject to such performance units as if they had been issued and outstanding from the date of grant up to, and including, the
merger effective time, less required withholding taxes.
 
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
 
A:
If we have obtained the stockholder approval, and assuming that the other conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, it is anticipated that the
merger will be completed in the first quarter of 2023. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the merger will take place as soon as
practicable (and, in any event, within three business days) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger described under the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger” (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing) or on such other date as agreed in writing by us
and Parent; provided, that, unless Parent otherwise agrees in writing, the consummation of the Merger will not occur prior to February 1, 2023.
 
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
 
A:
If the merger proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive
any payment for their shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, we will remain a public company and our common stock
will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, we will be required to
pay Parent the Company termination fee. Upon a termination of the merger agreement under certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to
pay us the Parent termination fee.
 
Q:
If the merger is completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares?
 
A:
Following the completion of the merger, your shares of common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the
merger consideration. In accordance with, and as required by the exchange agent’s customary procedures, you may receive an instruction request
letter, including instructions for effecting the exchange of your shares for the merger consideration.
 
Q:
When and where is the special meeting?
 
A:
The special meeting will be held on December 9, 2022 at 8:00 a.m., Arizona time, in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special
meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/STOR2022SM.
 
Q:
Who can vote and attend the special meeting?
 
A:
All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on October 24, 2022, are entitled to receive notice
of and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast
one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the
record date, there were 282,685,797 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
 
Q:
How do I attend the virtual special meeting?
 
A:
The special meeting will be held in a virtual-only format on December 9, 2022 at 8:00 a.m., Arizona time. You will not be able to physically attend the
special meeting. To access the virtual meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/STOR2022SM. The special meeting

form or other notice that you may receive, which will allow you to participate in the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are
a stockholder as of the record date.
 
Q:
What vote of stockholders is required to approve the merger proposal?
 
A:
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to
vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting. Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our
stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares
or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will
have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
 
Q:
What vote of stockholders is required to approve the advisory compensation proposal?
 
A:
Approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of
this proposal, if you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of proposal (assuming a
quorum is present).
 
Q:
What vote of stockholders is required to approve the adjournment proposal?
 
A:
Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this
proposal, if you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal (assuming a
quorum is present).
 
Q:
Why is my vote important?
 
A:
If you do not authorize your proxy or vote at the virtual special meeting, or do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it
will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special meeting. In addition, because the merger must be approved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal, if you abstain
from voting or fail to authorize your proxy or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to
vote, such abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
 
Q:
How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of our common stock?
 
A:
Our common stock has been listed on the NYSE under the symbol “STOR” since November 18, 2014. The merger consideration of $32.25 per share
represents a premium of approximately 20.4% over the closing price of our common stock of $26.79 on September 14, 2022, the last trading day prior
to the public announcement of the merger agreement, and a premium of approximately 17.8% over the 90-day volume weighted average stock price
through that date. Over the 12-month period ended September 14, 2022, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger
agreement, the closing price of our common stock ranged from a low of $24.79 to a high of $35.11. You are encouraged to obtain current market
quotations for our common stock.
 
Q:
How does our board of directors recommend that I vote?
 
A:
Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the
adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related compensation payable to our
named executive officers?
 
A:
In July 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to
approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
corporate transactions such as the merger.
 
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory compensation proposal?
 
A:
The vote to approve the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Approval of
this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our
board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the advisory compensation proposal, if the merger is completed, our named executive
officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.
 
Q:
Do any of the Company’s directors and executive officers have any interest in the merger that is different than mine?
 
A:
Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
generally. See the sections entitled “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” and “—Quantification of
Potential Payments and Benefits” for information about interests that our directors and executive officers have in the merger that are different than
yours.
 
Q:
What do I need to do now?
 
A:
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, including the exhibits attached to this proxy statement,
please vote your shares of common stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. Holders of our common stock will be entitled to
one vote for each share of common stock owned as of the record date.
 
Q:
How do I cast my vote?
 
A:
If you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote at the virtual special meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares at the
virtual special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope, or, if you prefer, by following the instructions on your proxy card for telephonic or Internet proxy
authorization. If the telephone or Internet option is available to you, we strongly encourage you to use it because it is faster and less costly.
Registered stockholders can transmit their voting instructions by telephone by calling (800) 690-6903 or on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com.
Telephone and Internet voting are available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, the day immediately prior to the special meeting. Have
your proxy card with you if you are going to authorize your proxy by telephone or through the Internet. To authorize your proxy by mail, please
complete sign, date and mail your proxy card in the envelope provided.
 
Q:
How do I cast my vote if my shares of common stock are held of record in “street name”?
 
A:
If you own shares of our common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in
accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, since brokers, banks and
other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement. If you

have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other
nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your common stock. If you hold your common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee
and wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a “legal proxy,” executed in your favor, from the broker, bank or other nominee
(which may take several days).
 
Q:
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?
 
A:
With respect to the merger proposal, if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of
a quorum, but such abstention will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal. With respect to the advisory compensation
proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum, but abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals.
With respect to the merger proposal, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares held in “street name,” your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and such failure to vote will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
With respect to the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at
the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares held in “street name,” your shares will
not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, but such failure to vote will not have any effect on
the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present).
 
Q:
How will proxy holders vote my shares of common stock?
 
A:
If you properly authorize a proxy prior to the virtual special meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct. If you authorize a
proxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and
“FOR” the adjournment proposal. Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the
virtual special meeting.
 
Q:
What happens if I sell my common stock before the special meeting?
 
A:
If you held common stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective time, you will retain your right to vote at the special
meeting, but not the right to receive the merger consideration for such shares. The right to receive the merger consideration when the merger
becomes effective will pass to the person who owns the shares you previously owned.
 
Q:
Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?
 
A:
Yes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it is
exercised by filing with our Corporate Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending and voting at
the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you
have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the foregoing options for changing your vote do not apply and instead you
must follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.
 
Q:
Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?
 
A:
Yes. The receipt of the merger consideration for each share of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
 
19
Table of Contents
you will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the difference, if any, between the merger consideration you receive and your
adjusted tax basis in your common stock. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may be required to withhold a portion of your merger
consideration under applicable tax laws, including, in the case of non-U.S. holders, pursuant to FIRPTA. See the section entitled “The Merger—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. We encourage
you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the merger to you.
 
Q:
What rights do I have if I oppose the merger?
 
A:
If you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the merger proposal. You are not, however, entitled to appraisal rights,
dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger under Maryland law because shares of our common stock
were listed on the NYSE on the record date. In addition, stockholders may not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an
objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by the MGCL, our
charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise any such rights unless our board of directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority
of the directors, determines that the rights apply. Our board of directors has made no such determination. See the section entitled “No Dissenters’
Rights of Appraisal.”
 
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
 
A:
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed
with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov when
filed.
 
Q:
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the virtual special meeting?
 
A:
If you are unable to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your
proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet.
 
Q:
Have any stockholders already agreed to approve the merger?
 
A:
No. There are no other agreements between Parent, Merger Sub or other affiliates of the Sponsors, on the one hand, and any of our stockholders,
on the other hand, in which a stockholder has agreed to vote in favor of the approval of the merger proposal.
 
Q:
Where can I find more information about the Company?
 
A:
We file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.storecapital.com. The
information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this proxy statement or
any other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC. You can also request copies of these documents from us. See the section entitled
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
 
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
 
A:
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview,
telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees, for which they will not receive additional compensation.
We have engaged Alliance Advisors, LLC (“Alliance Advisors”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately

$25,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and we have agreed to indemnify Alliance Advisors against certain losses,
costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations holding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees, that are
beneficially owned by others to send or cause to be sent proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners and will reimburse
such holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing.

These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about the expected benefits of the merger, the expected timing and completion of
the merger and our future business, performance and opportunities. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements
contained herein are based on reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. Forward-looking statements
involve numerous risks and uncertainties, and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on
assumptions, data or methods which may be incorrect or imprecise, and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions
and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and
describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “project,” “may,” “plan,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “likely” or similar expressions. You should not rely on forward-looking statements since
they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect
actual results, performances or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not
limited to:
 
•
risks associated with our ability to obtain the stockholder approval required to consummate the merger and the risk that the closing of the
merger will not occur within the expected timeframe or at all;

unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the merger;
 
•
the response of customers, business partners and competitors to the announcement of the merger and/or potential difficulties in employee
retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the merger;
 
•
the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against the parties and others related to the merger agreement;
 
•
risks that the merger disrupts our current plans and operations or diverts the attention of our management or employees from ongoing
business operations;
 
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement and, under certain
circumstances, require us to pay the Company termination fee;
 
•
our restricted ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement;
 
•
real estate risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in local markets and competition for customers
in such markets;

actual or perceived threats associated with the pandemic of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) or other public health crises;
 
•
rental rates that are unable to keep up with the pace of inflation;
 
•
the performance and financial condition of our customers;
 
•
real estate acquisition risks, including our ability to identify and complete acquisitions and/or failure of such acquisitions to perform in
accordance with projections;
 
•
the competitive environment in which we operate;
 
•
decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates;
 
22Table of Contents
•
potential defaults (including bankruptcy or insolvency) on, or non-renewal of, leases by customers;
 
•
our ability to raise debt and equity capital on attractive terms;
 
•
financing risks, including the risks that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and
interest and that we may be unable to refinance our existing debt upon maturity or obtain new financing on attractive terms at all;
 
•
lack of or insufficient amounts of insurance;
 
•
potential natural disasters and other liabilities and costs associated with the impact of climate change;

possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of
properties presently owned or previously owned by us;

on Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act.
There can be no assurance that the merger will in fact be consummated in the expected time frame, on the expected terms or at all. While forward-
looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For a further discussion of these and other
factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form

MERGER PROPOSAL
We are asking our stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub.
For detailed information regarding the merger proposal, see the information about the merger and the merger agreement throughout this proxy
statement, including the information set forth in the sections entitled “The Merger” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the merger agreement is
attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement.
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled
to vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, but do not
indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 1, your shares will be voted in accordance with the
recommendation of our board of directors, which is “FOR” this Proposal 1. Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of
votes our stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your
shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will
have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Stockholder approval of the merger proposal is a condition to the completion of the merger. In the event the merger proposal does not receive
stockholder approval, the merger cannot be completed.
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, we are asking
our stockholders to vote at the special meeting on an advisory basis regarding the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. Information intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K concerning this
compensation, subject to certain assumptions described therein, is presented in the section entitled “The Merger—Quantification of Potential Payments
and Benefits.”
The stockholder vote on this advisory compensation proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our board of directors.
Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the
outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.
We are asking our common stockholders to vote “FOR” the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that STORE Capital Corporation stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the named executive officers of STORE Capital Corporation that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as disclosed
pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the heading “The Merger—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits” beginning on page
66 (which disclosure includes the Golden Parachute Compensation Table required pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).” 
Adoption of the above resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. If
you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares
“FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 2, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors,
which is “FOR” this Proposal 2. If you abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory
compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
Stockholder approval of the advisory compensation proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger.

Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal.

We are asking our stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve any adjournments of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal.
Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. If you properly authorize your

All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on October 24, 2022, are entitled to receive notice
of and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast one

for quorum purposes at the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares

The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you
abstain from voting or fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee on how to vote, such abstention or failure to vote will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present).
Accordingly, in order for your shares to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must either return the enclosed proxy card, authorize your
proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet or vote at the virtual special meeting.
Votes cast by proxy or at the virtual special meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of election for the special
meeting. The inspector of election will also determine the number of shares of common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy.

STORE CAPITAL Corp_20221104_DEFM14A_20428387_4540170.Pdf,How to Authorize a Proxy,"How to Authorize a Proxy
Holders of record of our common stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of the following methods:
 
•
mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail;
 
•
authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions included with your proxy
card; or
 
•
attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast.
Regardless of whether you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares of common stock as
described above as promptly as possible.
Under NYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the special meeting.
A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the broker, bank or other nominee has
not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular proposal but
has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if you own shares of our common stock through a broker, bank or other
nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker,
bank or other nominee provides to you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three
proposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of our common stock
following the directions contained in such voting instruction card. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further information
regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares of our common
stock. If you hold shares of our common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a
“legal proxy,” executed in your favor, from the broker, bank or other nominee (which may take several days). Because approval of the merger proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes of our common stock entitled to be cast on the
merger proposal, and because your broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposal, the failure to provide
your broker, bank or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal. Because the approval
of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal,
and because your broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your broker, bank
or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present).

If you authorize a proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted at the special meeting as you indicate on your proxy. If no instructions are
indicated when you authorize your proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors.
Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment
proposal.
You may revoke your proxy at any time, but only before the proxy is voted at the virtual special meeting, in any of three ways:
 
•
by delivering, prior to the date of the special meeting, a written revocation of your proxy dated after the date of the proxy that is being
revoked to Chad A. Freed, our Executive Vice President – General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, at 8377 East Hartford
Drive, Suite 100, Scottsdale, Arizona 85255;
 
•
by delivering to our Corporate Secretary a later-dated, duly executed proxy or by authorizing your proxy by telephone or by Internet at a
date after the date of the previously authorized proxy relating to the same shares of common stock; or
 
•
by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting.
Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy. If you own shares of common stock
through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may revoke or change previously granted voting instructions by following the instructions provided by the
broker, bank or other nominee that is the registered owner of the shares.
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting.",37,37

We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview,
telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees, for which they will not receive additional compensation. We have
engaged Alliance Advisors to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $25,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, and we have agreed to indemnify Alliance Advisors against certain losses, costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement. The following chronology
does not purport to catalogue every conversation among our board of directors, the transaction committee, members of our management or our
representatives and other parties.
Our board of directors and senior management regularly review our strategies, performance and objectives in light of the current business,
economic and capital markets environments, as well as trends and developments in the net-lease REIT sector and real estate industry more generally. As
part of these reviews, our board of directors and senior management have periodically considered various potential strategic and financial initiatives, all
with the goal of maximizing stockholder value, and have recognized various opportunities and challenges that we face as a public company, including,
among other things, management’s ability to generate accretive acquisition opportunities and optimize returns on its existing portfolio against the current
market backdrop.
On April 5, 2022, while attending an investor conference in New York, New York, Mary B. Fedewa, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a
member of our board of directors, and other members of our senior management, met with investors throughout the day, including representatives of GIC,
which has been a stockholder of the Company over the past five years and, as of the date hereof, holds approximately 0.6% of the outstanding shares of
our common stock. During the meeting with GIC, the members of our senior management discussed publicly available information, including our results of
operations and general business, investment and financing strategies. Following the meeting, representatives of GIC requested that the parties meet
again over the following days to continue the discussion. In advance of the meeting, GIC executed a limited non-disclosure agreement in which it agreed
to keep non-public information discussed at the meeting, if any, confidential.
On April 7, 2022, members of our senior management and representatives of GIC met for lunch and continued to discuss the net-lease real estate
sector and market conditions generally. No specific transactions or terms were discussed at the lunch meeting. Later that week, a representative of GIC
called Ms. Fedewa and requested an in-person meeting to learn more about our business, investment and financing strategies. In advance of the next
meeting, GIC executed a second limited non-disclosure agreement in which it agreed to keep non-public information, discussed at the meeting, if any,
confidential.
On April 13, 2022, representatives of GIC attended in-person investor presentations conducted by members of our senior management at our
corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. During the presentations, the members of our senior management and representatives of GIC engaged in a
discussion of our business, investment and financing strategies. Following the meeting, representatives of GIC expressed a general interest in a potential
business opportunity with us and requested that we provide GIC with non-public information to facilitate GIC’s review of the Company. No specific
transaction terms were discussed.
On April 19, 2022, members of our senior management and a representative of DLA Piper, our outside legal counsel, had a call with Tawn Kelley, the
chairman of our board of directors, to provide an update on the recent meetings with GIC and discuss GIC’s request for non-public information.
Subsequently, on April 19, 2022, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with GIC (which agreement contained customary standstill restrictions,
which restrictions terminate in the event we enter into a definitive agreement with a third party to effect a sale of the Company), following which we
provided GIC with limited, non-public property-level operating and financial information. Over the next several weeks, GIC conducted a due diligence
review of the Company and engaged in high-level discussions with Ms. Fedewa and other members of our senior management regarding the due
diligence information.
 
33Table of Contents
After the close of business on May 27, 2022, a representative of GIC telephoned Ms. Fedewa and informed her that, based on their due diligence
review, GIC would be interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of the Company. The representative of GIC did not discuss specific terms or propose a
price or other valuation of the Company. Ms. Fedewa relayed this conversation to Ms. Kelley.
On May 31, 2022, Ms. Fedewa received a letter, dated May 27, 2022, from GIC (the “May 31 letter” and the proposal set forth therein, the “May 31
proposal”). The May 31 letter stated that GIC had followed us for several years in its capacity as a holder of our common stock and was impressed by the
performance of the portfolio and our long-term track record of growth. In the May 31 letter, GIC proposed to acquire the Company in an all-cash
transaction at a price of $32.00 per share, which represented a premium of 20% over the closing price of our common stock of $26.74 on May 26, 2022. The
May 31 letter also stated that (1) GIC was prepared to conduct all due diligence and concurrently negotiate a definitive merger agreement over a period of
45 days and would be willing to discuss the inclusion of a customary “go-shop” provision in the agreement, (2) the transaction would be funded with a
combination of equity financing of approximately $6.0 billion and debt financing of approximately $8.3 billion (including assumable debt currently on our
balance sheet and new debt financing) and would not be subject to any financing condition and (3) the transaction would be subject only to customary
closing conditions for the acquisition of a public REIT. The May 31 letter also stated that GIC would welcome the opportunity, at the appropriate time, to
speak with the Company about go-forward management arrangements, including with respect to preserving the Company’s operating structure while
providing the funding necessary to enable the Company to continue to grow its portfolio and accelerate its real estate acquisition plans. The May 31
letter did not outline any other terms of the proposal. The May 31 letter was circulated to our board of directors, as well as our legal advisors. On the prior
trading day, May 27, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $27.29 per share.
Later on May 31, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
DLA Piper, to discuss the terms and conditions of the May 31 proposal. In reviewing the May 31 proposal, our board of directors noted that, while the
proposal represented a credible offer from a substantial and well-capitalized firm, our board of directors would need to begin a strategic review process
and engage one or more financial advisors to evaluate the financial aspects of the May 31 proposal and provide information regarding other
opportunities available to us that could potentially enhance stockholder value, including, among others, continuing to execute our long-term business
strategies as a standalone public company, pursuing other strategic or financial initiatives or engaging in a process to explore interest in a sale of the
Company (with both strategic and financial buyers). After discussion, our board of directors determined that it should further review and discuss the
May 31 proposal, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, at a future meeting.
In addition, at the meeting on May 31, 2022, our board of directors established an ad hoc advisory transaction committee (the “transaction
committee”) to assist our board of directors in considering the May 31 proposal. Tawn Kelley, Catherine D. Rice, Jawad Ahsan and David M. Edwards, all
of whom are non-employee, independent directors were appointed to the transaction committee. Throughout the evaluation and negotiation process over
the next few months, the members of the transaction committee conducted several formal meetings. In addition, the members of the transaction committee,
as well as our board of directors, periodically met in executive session with only the independent directors and outside legal counsel present. In light of
our receipt of the May 31 proposal, our board of directors determined it would be advisable for the Company to retain financial advisors to assist the
board and authorized the transaction committee to select and retain such financial advisors.
Later on May 31, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
DLA Piper, to continue to discuss the terms and conditions of the May 31 proposal, the board’s strategic review process and potential financial advisors,
including Evercore, Goldman Sachs and other candidates. The transaction committee also discussed, with the assistance of our senior management and
in consultation with our legal advisors, the process to engage financial advisors and the range of advisory fees typically payable in connection with the
sale of a public company. Based on this discussion and our
 
34
Table of Contents
extensive experience with numerous investment banking firms, the transaction committee determined that it would be advisable to engage two financial
advisors and authorized Ms. Fedewa to contact representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs regarding their candidacy to serve as our financial
advisors. The transaction committee noted that Evercore’s and Goldman Sachs’ respective engagements and other relationships with each of the
Company and GIC would need to be reviewed to determine whether there were any conflicts that would interfere with their ability to serve as independent
financial advisors. The transaction committee considered Evercore as a potential candidate to assist and advise our board of directors because of
Evercore’s qualifications, experience and reputation, relationship with the Company, substantial knowledge of the REIT sector and its involvement in
recent strategic transactions in the net-lease REIT sector. The transaction committee considered Goldman Sachs as a potential candidate to assist and
advise our board of directors because of Goldman Sachs’ qualifications, experience and reputation, long-standing relationship with the Company,
knowledge of the net-lease REIT sector and its involvement in recent acquisition transactions in the public REIT industry. At the conclusion of the
meeting, the members of the transaction committee met in executive session with the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss the transaction
committee’s role and responsibilities and the board’s strategic review process.
On June 3, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of DLA
Piper, to discuss the Company’s existing five-year strategic plan (the “five-year plan”). The transaction committee, with the assistance of our senior
management and in consultation with our legal advisors, reviewed and discussed the five-year plan, which included the financial projections (as defined
below under the section entitled “—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”) regarding our future operations for fiscal years ending December 31,
2022 through December 31, 2026. Our senior management reviewed with the transaction committee the assumptions underlying the financial projections,
including estimates of future capital costs, capitalization rates and interest rates, and highlighted certain challenges we could face as a standalone public
company, including the deteriorating credit markets and rising interest rate environment, in the context of evaluating and achieving the financial
projections. Following discussion and questions of senior management about the financial projections, the transaction committee confirmed that the
financial projections provided an appropriate framework to evaluate the May 31 proposal. Also at the meeting, Ms. Fedewa provided an update on her
recent discussions with representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs and discussed the expected roles and responsibilities of each firm. After
discussion, the transaction committee authorized our senior management to negotiate engagement letters with Evercore and Goldman Sachs and to
provide them the financial projections for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses. At the conclusion of the meeting,
the members of the transaction committee met in executive session with the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss the role of the transaction
committee and other topics related to the board’s strategic review process.
Later on June 3, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper. The representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs were introduced and described their respective experience
and qualifications to serve as financial advisors. The representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs also provided an outline of potential next steps in
the board’s strategic review process and various factors to consider in connection with the board’s evaluation of the May 31 proposal, the five-year plan
and other strategic and financial initiatives available to the Company. Our board of directors, with the assistance of our senior management and in
consultation with the representatives of Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, discussed, among other matters, (1) the current economic environment
and certain challenges facing the net-lease real estate sector generally and the Company in particular, (2) the five-year plan, including the financial
projections and their underlying assumptions, (3) GIC’s businesses, transaction history and capital sources, and (4) the potential next steps in the
strategic review process. Our board of directors confirmed that Evercore and Goldman Sachs should prepare a presentation regarding their preliminary
financial analyses with respect to the Company and certain financial aspects of the May 31 proposal for the next meeting of our board of directors. At the
conclusion of the meeting, the independent directors met in executive session with representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss, among other matters,
the duties of our board of directors in connection with the evaluation of the May 31 proposal, the
 
35
Table of Contents
presentations from Evercore and Goldman Sachs, the five-year plan (including the financial projections) and related matters.
On June 10, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss the May 31 proposal, the five-year plan and the board’s strategic review process. Representatives of
Evercore and Goldman Sachs discussed with the transaction committee their preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company and certain
financial aspects of the May 31 proposal, as well as other strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company, including remaining a standalone
public company or initiating a formal process to contact potential buyers, including other publicly traded REITs and financial sponsors, regarding a sale
of the Company. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs also reviewed certain financial risks to our long-term business strategies, including the
deteriorating credit markets and rising interest rate environment, and potential options for the Company to respond to the May 31 proposal. The
transaction committee continued to discuss, with the assistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial and legal advisors, the
advantages and risks of a proposed transaction with GIC, including, among other things, whether the May 31 proposal represented an attractive
valuation for stockholders when considered in light of the five-year plan and the transaction committee’s knowledge and understanding of our business,
operations, management, financial condition and prospects and the various challenges we could continue to face as a standalone public company. At the
conclusion of the meeting, the members of the transaction committee met in executive session with the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss
the May 31 proposal and related matters. Following extensive discussion, the transaction committee resolved to recommend to our board of directors that
we engage with GIC regarding the May 31 proposal.
At GIC’s request, on June 12, 2022, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of our board of directors, had a call with
representatives of GIC. During the call, representatives of GIC informed Evercore and Goldman Sachs that the 45-day due diligence and negotiation
period referenced in the May 31 letter would not begin until the parties came to an agreement in principle on valuation, subject to the negotiation of the
definitive merger agreement and other customary conditions.
On June 13, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss, among other matters, the five-year plan and the terms and conditions of the May 31 proposal.
Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs reviewed with our board of directors their preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company,
certain financial aspects of the May 31 proposal, other strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company and potential options for the
Company to respond to the May 31 proposal. The members of our senior management and our board of directors discussed certain risks related to the
execution of our business plan, including the potential for an economic slowdown, the impact of rising borrowing costs, and the discount to estimated
net asset value at which our common stock has recently traded, all of which have the potential to adversely impact our ability to fund future acquisitions
at an accretive cost of capital. Our board of directors also discussed, with the assistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial
and legal advisors, the best process for maximizing stockholder value if the Company were to be sold, including whether a competitive bidding process
would yield a higher price than GIC’s proposal and the use of a customary “go-shop” provision to facilitate competing bids after signing a definitive
merger agreement, as well as benefits and risks to our business posed by contacting other potential buyers before engaging with GIC, including the risk
that engaging with or contacting other potential buyers prior to signing a definitive merger agreement with GIC could jeopardize the availability of GIC’s
proposal. Our board of directors also discussed with our senior management and our financial and legal advisors other potential risks and considerations,
including, among other concerns, that market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt our business and risk employee turnover,
as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price volatility, and that there were a limited number of potential buyers with the
financial ability to acquire the Company (including as a result of rising interest rates and the deterioration in the credit markets). At the conclusion of the
meeting, our board of directors met in executive session with the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss the
 
36
Table of Contents
May 31 proposal and a potential counteroffer. After further discussion of the preliminary financial analyses presented by representatives of Evercore and
Goldman Sachs and the best path forward to maximize value for our stockholders, our board of directors determined to move forward with bilateral
negotiations with GIC and authorized the transaction committee to engage further with our financial advisors to develop and submit to GIC a counteroffer
with a price per share of at least $34.00 in cash.
Later on June 13, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to continue to discuss the May 31 proposal, as well as other strategic alternatives that might be available to the
Company, including remaining a standalone public company or initiating a formal sale process, and the benefits and risks related to each, including those
discussed at prior meetings of the transaction committee and our board of directors. After further discussion of the best path forward to maximize value
for stockholders, the transaction committee determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to pursue a transaction with
GIC with a price per share of at least $34.00 in cash, but that any definitive merger agreement with GIC must contain a customary “go-shop” provision or
other mechanism that would permit us to solicit and entertain potentially superior proposals from other bidders after executing a definite merger
agreement with GIC. The transaction committee then instructed the representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to submit a counteroffer to GIC with a
price per share of $34.00 in cash and to inform GIC that we would require that any definitive merger agreement include a customary “go-shop” provision.
On the prior trading day, June 10, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $26.39 per share.
Following the transaction committee meeting, on June 14, 2022, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the
transaction committee (as authorized by our board of directors), contacted representatives of GIC to inform them of our counteroffer with a price per share
of $34.00 in cash and a requirement that any definitive merger agreement between the parties include a customary “go-shop” provision. GIC did not
provide a definitive response to our counteroffer at this time.
Throughout the remainder of June and July 2022, we provided additional customary due diligence information to GIC and its advisors and made
members of our senior management and advisors available to such parties to address their questions.
On June 17, 2022, representatives of GIC contacted representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to inform them that GIC remained committed to
pursuing an acquisition of the Company, but, given the current state of the capital markets, that GIC would need additional time to develop a financing
package before formally responding to our counteroffer.
Later on June 17, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and a representative
of DLA Piper. The transaction committee discussed our financial advisors’ recent discussions with GIC, including GIC’s continuing commitment to pursue
an acquisition of the Company and its need for additional time to develop a financing package.
On July 5, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of Evercore,
Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs provided an update on their recent discussions with GIC, including
GIC’s continuing efforts to coordinate a debt financing package, and noted that, due to continuing market volatility, GIC had not formally responded to
our counterproposal. Our board of directors, with the assistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,
discussed, among other matters, the 45-day due diligence and negotiation period proposed by GIC, the time sensitive nature of the potential transaction
and the various possible outcomes of the negotiations with GIC. At the conclusion of the meeting, our board of directors met in executive session with
the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss the potential transaction and related matters.
On July 19, 2022, acting at the direction of our board of directors, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs had a meeting with
representatives of GIC and its advisors. During the meeting, the representatives of GIC
 
37
Table of Contents
informed Evercore and Goldman Sachs that GIC would like to bring in an equity partner to the potential transaction. Subsequently on July 20, 2022, at the
request of GIC, the Company and GIC entered into a confidentiality agreement with Oak Street, as a potential equity partner and co-bidder with GIC,
following which we provided Oak Street with access to the virtual data room containing our due diligence materials. Over the next few weeks, Oak Street
engaged in a due diligence review of the Company, including property-level information. In addition, on July 26, 2022, at the request of GIC, the Company
and GIC entered into a confidentiality agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (“Credit Suisse”) (an affiliate of Column Financial, Inc.), as a
potential source of debt financing to GIC and Oak Street, following which Credit Suisse engaged in a due diligence review of the Company, including
property-level information.
On July 26, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of DLA
Piper, to further discuss the formal engagement of Evercore and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors. The transaction committee reviewed the customary
written relationships disclosure related to the Company and GIC provided by each of Evercore and Goldman Sachs and distributed to the transaction
committee prior to the meeting. After discussion, including with the representatives of DLA Piper, the transaction committee determined that those
relationships would not interfere with either firm’s ability to serve as a financial advisor to the Company. The representatives of DLA Piper then reviewed
with the transaction committee the material terms of the proposed engagement letters with each of Evercore and Goldman Sachs. Following this
discussion, the transaction committee determined to formally engage Evercore and Goldman Sachs as our financial advisors and approved their
respective engagement letters. As authorized by the transaction committee, on July 27, 2022, we executed engagement letters with each of Evercore and
Goldman Sachs.
On July 28, 2022, a representative of GIC delivered to Ms. Fedewa separate non-binding proposal letters, dated as of July 28, 2022, from each of GIC
and Oak Street (together, the “July 28 letters” and the proposal set forth therein, the “July 28 proposal”). In the July 28 letters, GIC and Oak Street
proposed to acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.00 per share, which represented a premium of 14% over the closing price of
our common stock of $28.07 on July 27, 2022. While the July 28 letters reflected the same offer price per share as the May 31 proposal, due to the
continuing deterioration in the credit markets and rising interest rate environment, the offer set forth in the July 28 letters contained a substantially higher
equity commitment from GIC and Oak Street. In this regard, the July 28 letters stated that (1) GIC and Oak Street were prepared to conduct all due
diligence and concurrently negotiate a definitive merger agreement over a period of no more than 45 days and (2) the transaction would be funded with a
combination of equity financing of approximately $8.3 billion (reflecting an increase of approximately $2.3 billion in the overall equity commitment, as
compared to the equity commitment stated in the May 31 letter) and debt financing of approximately $5.9 billion (comprised of approximately $3.7 billion
of assumable debt currently on our balance sheet and approximately $2.2 billion of new debt financing currently under negotiation, reflecting a decrease
of approximately $2.3 billion in the overall amount of expected debt financing, as compared to the debt financing contemplated in the May 31 letter) and
would not be subject to any financing contingency. In addition, the July 28 letter from GIC noted GIC would be willing to discuss the inclusion of a
customary “go-shop” in the definitive merger agreement. The July 28 letters did not outline any other terms of the offer. The July 28 letters were circulated
to our board of directors, as well as our financial and legal advisors.
On July 29, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss the terms and conditions of the July 28 proposal. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs
discussed with the transaction committee their respective preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company and certain financial aspects of the
July 28 proposal. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs also discussed, among other matters, (1) Oak Street’s businesses, transaction history
and capital sources, (2) the status of the due diligence process, and (3) the significant changes in economic conditions since GIC submitted the May 31
proposal, including the continued deterioration of the credit markets, lack of available debt financing, rising interest rates and volatility in the capital
markets. The transaction committee continued to discuss, with the
 
38
Table of Contents
assistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial and legal advisors, whether the July 28 proposal represented an attractive
valuation for stockholders when considered in the context of the five-year plan and the various challenges we could face as a standalone public
company. Following extensive discussion, the transaction committee resolved to recommend to our board of directors that we submit another
counteroffer to GIC with a price per share of $33.00 in cash.
On July 31, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of Evercore,
Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss the terms and conditions of the July 28 proposal from GIC and Oak Street. Representatives of Evercore and
Goldman Sachs discussed with our board of directors their respective preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company and certain financial
aspects of the July 28 proposal. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs also discussed, among other matters, Oak Street’s businesses,
transaction history and capital sources and the significant changes in economic conditions since GIC submitted the May 31 proposal, including the
continued deterioration of the credit markets, lack of available debt financing, rising interest rates and volatility in the capital markets. Our board of
directors continued to discuss, with the assistance of our senior management and in consultation with our financial and legal advisors, whether the July
28 proposal represented an attractive valuation for stockholders when considered in the context of the five-year plan and the various challenges we could
face as a standalone public company. After further discussion of the best path forward to maximize value for stockholders, and consistent with the
recommendation of the transaction committee, our board of directors determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to
continue to pursue a transaction with GIC and Oak Street at a price per share of at least $33.00 in cash. Our board of directors then instructed the
representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to submit a counteroffer to GIC and Oak Street at a price per share of $33.00 in cash.
Later on July 31, 2022, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of our board of directors, contacted representatives
of GIC to inform them of our counteroffer at a price per share of $33.00 in cash. In response to our counteroffer, on July 31, 2022, the representatives of
GIC and Oak Street conveyed their “best and final” offer with a price per share of $32.25 in cash (the “final proposal”) and confirmed that any definitive
merger agreement between the parties would include a customary “go-shop” provision with a two-tier termination fee. GIC and Oak Street reaffirmed their
commitment to complete due diligence and negotiate a definitive merger agreement in 45 days and that there would be no financing contingency in the
agreement. GIC and Oak Street did not outline any other terms of the final proposal.
On August 1, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, to discuss the final proposal. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs reviewed with our board of
directors their respective preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company (as previously presented at the board meeting on the day before)
and certain financial aspects of the final proposal. In consultation with its financial advisors, our board of directors determined that GIC and Oak Street
would not improve upon the final proposal and that asking for additional improvement in the purchase price would put the transaction at risk and delay
the commencement of the 45-day period to complete due diligence and negotiate the definitive merger agreement. Our board of directors discussed,
among other things, whether the final proposal represented an attractive valuation of the Company when considered in light of the five-year plan and the
board’s knowledge and understanding of our business, operations, management, financial condition and prospects. Based on the discussion at this
meeting and previous board and transaction committee meetings, our board of directors concluded that the final proposal from GIC and Oak Street would,
if consummated, provide greater certainty of value (and less risk) to our stockholders relative to the potential trading price of our common stock after
accounting for the various challenges we could continue to face as a standalone public company. After considering our strategic alternatives to a
potential transaction with GIC and Oak Street, including continuing as a standalone public company, our board of directors authorized the representatives
of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to confirm to GIC and Oak Street an agreement in principle at a price per share of $32.25 in cash, in accordance with the
terms outlined in the final proposal, and instructed DLA Piper to begin negotiations of the definitive merger agreement and related documents.

Subsequently on August 1, 2022, as directed by our board of directors, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs confirmed to a
representative of GIC an agreement in principle at a price per share of $32.25 in cash and further confirmed that our board of directors was willing to move
forward with negotiating and finalizing a definitive merger agreement in accordance with the terms outlined in the final proposal. The representatives of
GIC agreed that this agreement in principle would commence the 45-day period to complete due diligence and negotiate the definitive merger agreement
and related documents.
From August 1, 2022 through the signing of the merger agreement on September 15, 2022, we continued to provide additional customary due
diligence information to GIC and Oak Street and their respective advisors, as well as Credit Suisse and its advisors, as their potential source of committed
debt financing, coordinated due diligence calls and made members of our senior management available to such parties to address their questions.
On August 3, 2022, DLA Piper provided an initial draft of the proposed merger agreement to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP
(“Skadden”), legal advisors to GIC. The draft merger agreement contemplated, among other things, (1) a customary all-cash merger, (2) a customary 30-
day “go-shop” period with a two-tier termination fee equal to 1.5% of the equity value of the merger if we terminated the merger agreement within 40 days
to accept a superior proposal received during the first 30 days after signing the merger agreement, and otherwise 3.0% of the equity value of the merger,
(3) a reverse termination fee equal to 10.0% of the equity value of the merger and a right to specifically enforce the merger agreement (subject to certain
customary terms and conditions), and (4) that we would be permitted to pay regular quarterly dividends to holders of our common stock in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger.
On August 19, 2022, Skadden provided initial comments from GIC and Oak Street on the draft merger agreement. The revised draft of the merger
agreement contemplated, among other things, (1) a customary all-cash merger, (2) a customary 30-day “go shop” period, with a two-tier termination fee
equal to 1.5% of the equity value of the merger if we terminated the merger agreement within 30 days to accept a superior proposal received during the
first 30 days after signing the merger agreement, and otherwise 3.0% of the equity value of the merger, (3) a reverse termination fee equal to 3.0% of the
equity value of the merger and a right to specifically enforce the merger agreement (subject to certain customary terms and conditions), (4) that we would
not be permitted to pay regular quarterly dividends to holders of our common stock during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and
the closing of the merger, other than those necessary to maintain REIT status (with the per share purchase price being decreased by an amount equal to
any such dividends), and (5) an additional closing condition in favor of Parent related to the parties’ receipt of the CFIUS approval.
Between August 20, 2022 and September 14, 2022, DLA Piper and Skadden exchanged several drafts of the proposed merger agreement and the
parties’ respective management teams and legal and financial advisors engaged in extensive negotiations regarding the terms of the proposed merger
agreement and other related transaction documents. During the course of these negotiations, areas of discussion and negotiation between the parties
included, among other things, (1) the representations and warranties to be made by the parties, (2) our obligations with respect to the operation of our
business during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger, (3) the scope of the restrictions applicable to
actions taken by us during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger (including the provisions related to our
ability to pay regular quarterly dividends to holders of our common stock during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing
of the merger), (4) the “go-shop” provisions related to our solicitation of competing acquisition proposals after the signing of the merger agreement, (5)
our obligations to cooperate with Parent’s debt financing and equity syndication efforts, (6) the conditions to completion of the merger, including
provisions related to the CFIUS approval, (7) the remedies available to each party under the merger agreement, including the triggers of the termination
fee payable to Parent and reverse termination fee payable to us (and the terms of the guaranty of certain payment obligations by an affiliate of GIC and by
Oak Street), and the amount of the reverse termination fee, (8) the provisions regarding our equity awards, employee benefit plans, severance and other
compensation matters, and (9) the proposed timing for the closing of the merger.

On August 31, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs provided an update on their recent discussions with GIC and
Oak Street, including the status of the due diligence and GIC’s approval processes and negotiation of a commitment letter for the debt financing, and
discussed next steps in the process. Representatives of DLA Piper then reviewed the material open points on the latest draft of the proposed merger
agreement, including our ability to pay regular quarterly dividends to holders of our common stock during the period between the signing of the merger
agreement and the closing of the merger, the size of the reverse termination fee and the proposed timing for the closing of the merger.
On September 2, 2022, Skadden provided an initial draft of the form of equity commitment letter from GIC and Oak Street.
On September 3, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and representatives of
Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper. Ms. Kelley, the chairman of our board of directors, provided a summary of the status of negotiations with GIC
and Oak Street and reviewed the following negotiated key business terms: (1) our ability to pay the regular quarterly dividend to holders of our common
stock for the quarter ending September 30, 2022, in an amount not to exceed $0.41 per share (which GIC and Oak Street had initially rejected), (2) a two-tier
termination fee equal to 1.5% of the equity value of the merger if we terminated the merger agreement within 35 days to accept a superior proposal
received during the first 30 days after signing the merger agreement (which five-day extension GIC and Oak Street initially rejected), (3) a reverse
termination fee of 5.5% of the equity value of the merger (an increase from the 3.0% initially proposed by GIC and Oak Street), and (4) the proposed timing
for the closing of the merger (including the earliest date for closing proposed by GIC and Oak Street given certain timing considerations related to their
debt financing packaging). Representatives of DLA Piper then reviewed with our board of directors their fiduciary duties in connection with a potential
sale of the Company and summarized the proposed terms of the draft merger agreement with GIC and Oak Street, including the key execution risks and
other open issues in the agreement, and suggested areas for further negotiation. Representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs next discussed with our
board of directors the current economic and financial market environments, our recent stock price performance, their respective preliminary financial
analyses with respect to the Company and certain financial aspects of the final proposal. Our board of directors, with the assistance of our senior
management and in consultation with our financial advisors, also reviewed and discussed the five-year plan, which had not changed since it was
originally presented to our board of directors in June 2022, except to include an additional year of financial projections for fiscal year ending December 31,
2027. Our board of directors then met in executive session with the representatives of DLA Piper to further discuss the terms of the potential transaction
and related matters. At the conclusion of the meeting, our board of directors authorized the representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to confirm to
GIC and Oak Street an agreement on the key business terms described above, and instructed DLA Piper to work to finalize the definitive merger agreement
and related documents reflecting those terms.
On September 5, 2022, representatives of GIC and Oak Street attended management presentations conducted by members of our senior
management (and attended by representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs as requested by the Company). There were no discussions with our senior
management regarding their future roles, compensation, retention or investment arrangements in connection with the proposed transaction during the
management presentations or at any time from the initial meetings between our management and GIC in April and through the filing of this proxy
statement. Following these management presentations, members of our senior management continued to participate in follow-up due diligence sessions
with GIC and Oak Street and their advisors. Representatives of Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper, as applicable, also regularly attended these due
diligence sessions as requested by the Company.

In the evening of September 14, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of our senior management and
representatives of Evercore, Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper. Members of our senior management and representatives of Evercore, Goldman Sachs and
DLA Piper updated our board of directors on the discussions with GIC and Oak Street since the last board meeting. Representatives of DLA Piper
reviewed with the directors their legal obligations in connection with their consideration and potential approval of the transaction with GIC and Oak
Street. Representatives of DLA Piper also provided an overview of the negotiation process to date with representatives of GIC and Oak Street, indicating
that negotiations with GIC and Oak Street were complete, and provided a presentation regarding the terms of the definitive merger agreement and related
transaction documents. Our board of directors noted that, although GIC’s and Oak Street’s proposals included general statements that the surviving
company would seek to continue our operating model, to date, GIC had not had discussions with our senior management regarding their future roles,
compensation, retention or investment arrangements in connection with the proposed transaction.
Representatives of Evercore then reviewed Evercore’s financial analyses summarized below under “—Opinions of Our Financial Advisors—
Opinion of Evercore.” Following its presentation, Evercore rendered to our board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion, dated September 14, 2022, that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications
and conditions described in Evercore’s written opinion, the merger consideration of $32.25 per share to be received by the holders of our common stock
(other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully
described below in the section “—Opinions of Our Financial Advisors—Opinion of Evercore.” Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed
Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses summarized below under “—Opinions of Our Financial Advisors—Opinion of Goldman Sachs.” Following its
presentation, Goldman Sachs rendered to our board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, dated
September 15, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set
forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $32.25 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of our
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in the section “—
Opinions of Our Financial Advisors—Opinion of Goldman Sachs.” Our board of directors were provided, prior to this meeting, with updated disclosures
from each of Evercore and Goldman Sachs regarding fees each had received or earned from the Company and each of GIC and Oak Street and their
respective affiliates.
Following extensive discussion, our board of directors unanimously (1) approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, (2) determined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (3) directed that the merger be submitted to the

of the merger agreement and related transaction documents and, during the early morning of September 15, 2022, the parties finalized, executed and

financial markets in New York on September 15, 2022, the merger was announced in a press release jointly issued by the Company, GIC and Oak Street.
The press release announcing the merger also noted that the merger agreement included a 30-day go-shop period that would expire on October 15, 2022.
On September 15, 2022, representatives of Evercore and Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of our board of directors, began contacting
potential counterparties that might consider entering into an alternative transaction with the Company in connection with the go-shop period.
During the go-shop period, Evercore and Goldman Sachs communicated with 15 potential counterparties that may have an interest in the net-lease
real estate sector and the financial ability to acquire the Company, consisting of four strategic parties and 11 financial sponsor parties. Of these parties,
we executed confidentiality agreements with two parties (which agreements contained customary standstill restrictions, but did not include “don’t-ask
don’t-waive” provisions), and subsequently provided non-public due diligence information about the Company and its properties to such parties. To
date, no party has made an acquisition proposal following the execution of the merger agreement. During the go-shop period, Evercore and Goldman
Sachs provided regular updates regarding the go-shop process to our board of directors.
The go-shop period expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on October 15, 2022.
Reasons for the Merger",39,49
STORE CAPITAL Corp_20221104_DEFM14A_20428387_4540170.Pdf,Reasons for the Merger,"Reasons for the Merger
In reaching its unanimous decision to determine and declare that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to recommend that our stockholders approve the merger, our board of directors consulted with
members of our management, as well as our financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors
which our board of directors viewed as supporting its unanimous decision:
 
•
the current and historical trading prices of our common stock, and the premium provided by the merger consideration of $32.25 per share;
 
•
the fact that the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount that provides our stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately
upon the closing of the merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent or greater value
from our long-term business plan;
 
•
the fact that our common stock has consistently traded at a discounted multiple as compared to our net-lease industry peer companies;
 
•
the various risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company, including our need to frequently raise capital due to the
capital-intensive nature of our business, and the difficulty and increasing cost of obtaining capital in a high interest rate environment;
 
•
the fact that the merger consideration was the result of arm’s-length negotiations;
 
•
the fact that the merger consideration reflects an increase over the initial offer and the right to pay the regular quarterly dividend for the
quarter ended September 30, 2022, and also reflects the Sponsors’ best and final offer;
 
•
our board of directors’ belief that there exists few other potential third parties with both interest in the net-lease space and with the financial
ability to acquire us in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock and current capital
markets uncertainties;
 
•
our board of directors’ belief that contacting other potential bidders before announcing a transaction would result in significant risks to us
and our business, including concerns that leaks or rumors regarding a potential transaction could disrupt our business, risk employee
turnover and cause turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price volatility;
 
43Table of Contents
•
our right to solicit potential third party purchasers prior to the no-shop period start date, to change, withhold, qualify or withdraw the
recommendation of our board of directors, and to terminate the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, in order to enter into a
definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a superior proposal, upon payment of the Company termination fee;
 
•
advice from our independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the two-tiered Company termination fee structure is
reasonable under the circumstances and not likely to preclude any other interested party from making an acquisition proposal;
 
•
the probability that the merger will be completed based on, among other things, the Sponsors’ substantial available capital and extensive
experience in the real estate industry, the absence of a financing contingency, the substantial Parent termination fee payable to us if the
merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, and our right under the merger agreement to seek specific performance and require
the Sponsors to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under certain circumstances;
 
•
the oral opinion of Evercore, subsequently confirmed in Evercore’s written opinion, dated September 14, 2022, to the effect that, as of the
date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s
written opinion, the merger consideration of $32.25 per share of common stock to be received by holders of shares of our common stock
(other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more
fully described below in the section entitled “—Opinions of Our Financial Advisors—Opinion of Evercore;”
 
•
the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, dated September 15, 2022, to the effect that,
as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’
written opinion, the $32.25 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in
the section “—Opinions of Our Financial Advisors—Opinion of Goldman Sachs;” and
 
•
the fact that the merger is subject to our receipt of the stockholder approval, and that our stockholders are free to vote against the merger
for any reason, including if a higher offer were to be made prior to the special meeting (in certain cases subject to the payment of the
Company termination fee if we subsequently were to enter into a definitive agreement relating to, or to consummate, any acquisition
proposal).
Our board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the merger agreement, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement:
 
•
our inability, after the no-shop period start date, to solicit competing proposals and the possibility that the Company termination fee
payable by us upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential bidders from
making an acquisition proposal;
 
•
the fact that, following the merger, we will no longer exist as an independent public company and that our existing stockholders will not
participate in any future earnings or growth;
 
•
the risk that an alternative transaction or different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial to our stockholders than the
proposed merger;
 
•
the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking
business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the merger; and
 
•
the fact that, under the terms of the merger agreement, after the payment of the regular quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended
September 30, 2022, we are not permitted to make, declare or pay any additional regular quarterly cash dividends or distributions.

While we have from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, we have not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed
internal projections as to future performance, earnings or other results beyond the then-current annual period due to, among other reasons, the
uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the merger, prior to the execution
of the merger agreement, our management prepared and provided to our board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger and our
financial advisors, Evercore and Goldman Sachs, for their use and reliance in connection with their financial analyses and opinions, certain non-public,

Important Information About the Financial Projections
The financial projections are included solely to give our stockholders access to certain information that was made available to our board of
directors and Evercore and Goldman Sachs and used by Evercore and Goldman Sachs in connection with their financial analysis and fairness opinions.
The financial projections have not been updated following September 14, 2022 to reflect our current views of our future financial performance, and should
not be treated as guidance with respect to projected results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 or any other period. The financial projections are
subjective in many respects and were prepared solely for our internal use, for Evercore and Goldman Sachs in connection with their financial analysis and
fairness opinions. The financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with
published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information or GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not compiled, examined, audited or performed any
procedures with respect to the financial projections, and has not expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this information or its
achievability. The inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by us that the
information is material.
Certain of the above financial data were not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including NOI, Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, levered free cash flow
and AFFO per share. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our financial results and believe that they enhance investors’
understanding of our financial performance and the comparability of our results to prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered
in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may
differ from others in the industry and our Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and levered free cash flow are not necessarily comparable with similar titles used by
other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Evercore or Goldman Sachs for purposes of their respective
opinions to our board of directors as described below in the section entitled “—Opinions of Our Financial Advisors” or by our board of directors in
connection with its consideration of the merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the financial
projections above.

Table of Contents
The financial projections, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables, estimates and assumptions that
necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, net acquisition volume and future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial
market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond our control. The financial projections were developed
under the assumption of continued standalone operation, do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on
which the financial projections were prepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the merger or any effects of the merger.
Further, the financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be consummated and should not be viewed as accurate
or continuing in that context. The financial projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Given that the
financial projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. Important factors that
may affect actual results and cause the financial projections to not be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to our
business (including our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business,
economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and other factors described in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” and the risks described in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, which reports can be found as described under “Where
You Can Find More Information.” The financial projections also reflect numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time they were
prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the financial
projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized above will be realized. Our stockholders are urged to review
our most recent SEC filings for a description of the reported and anticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital resources, including
in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.
The inclusion of the financial projections and accompanying narrative in the table above should not be regarded as an indication that we or our
affiliates or representatives consider the financial projections to be predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as
such. We and our affiliates and other representatives can provide no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the financial projections,
and we and our affiliates and representatives undertake no obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the financial projections to reflect
circumstances existing after the dates on which the financial projections were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that
any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying the financial projections are shown to be in error or are no longer appropriate. Some or all of the
assumptions that have been made in connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial
projections were prepared. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the financial projections, which were prepared as of an earlier
date. We and our affiliates and other representatives make no representation regarding our ultimate performance compared to the information contained in
the financial projections or that the financial projections will be achieved.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the financial projections, our stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if
any, reliance on the financial projections.
Opinions of Our Financial Advisors
Opinion of Evercore
Pursuant to an engagement letter, dated July 27, 2022, we engaged Evercore to act as our financial advisor in connection with the merger. As part of
this engagement, our board of directors requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be
received by holders of shares of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the merger. At a
 
47
Table of Contents
meeting of our board of directors held on September 14, 2022, Evercore rendered to our board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion, dated September 14, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s written opinion, the merger consideration of $32.25 per share to be received by holders
of shares of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated September 14, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as
Exhibit B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. We encourage you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety.
Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, our board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with
its evaluation of the merger and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of
shares of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the merger. The opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to our board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of our common stock should
vote or act in respect of the merger. Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial
strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore, among other things:
 
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that Evercore deemed to be relevant;
 
•
reviewed the financial projections (as defined above in the section entitled “—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”), as approved
for Evercore’s use by our board of directors;
 
•
discussed with our management their assessment of our past and current operations, current financial condition and prospects, and the
financial projections;
 
•
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of our common stock;
 
•
compared our financial performance and our stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded companies that
Evercore deemed relevant;
 
•
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated as of September 14, 2022, of the merger agreement, including the interim
operating covenants of the Company in the context of the potential closing date of the merger; and
 
•
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed appropriate.
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information
publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent
verification of such information (and assumed no responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and further relied upon
the assurances of the management of the Company that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate
or misleading. With respect to the financial projections, Evercore assumed, with the consent of our board of directors, that the financial projections were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company as to the future
financial performance of the Company and the other matters covered thereby. Evercore expressed no view as to the financial projections, or the
assumptions on which they were based (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving the financial projections).
 
48
Table of Contents
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the final executed merger agreement did not
differ from the draft merger agreement reviewed by Evercore, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the merger agreement
were true and correct, that each party would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the merger agreement and
that all conditions to the consummation of the merger would be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore further assumed, in all respects
material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the merger would be
obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the merger or
reduce the contemplated benefits to the holders of our common stock of the merger.
Evercore did not conduct a physical inspection of our properties or facilities and did not make or assume any responsibility for making any
independent valuation or appraisal of our assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities), nor
was Evercore furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate our solvency or fair value under any state or federal laws
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore’s opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to Evercore as of
September 14, 2022 and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could be evaluated as of that date. Subsequent
developments may affect Evercore’s opinion and Evercore does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders of our common
stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates), from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration. Evercore did not express
any view on, and its opinion does not address, the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any
other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid
or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration or
otherwise. Evercore was not asked to, nor did it express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement
or the merger, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated
by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the merger agreement. Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative merits of
the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business
decision of the Company to engage in the merger. In arriving at its opinion, Evercore was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any
third party with respect to the acquisition of any or all of the shares of our common stock or any business combination or other extraordinary transaction
involving the Company. Evercore’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to our board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the
merger, including as to how any holder of shares of our common stock should vote or act in respect of the merger. Evercore did not express any opinion
as to the prices at which shares of our common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets
on the Company or the merger or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company to pay its
obligations when they come due. Evercore is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and has assumed the accuracy and completeness of
assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.
Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with our board of directors on September 14, 2022 in
connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
Evercore. The order of the analyses described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by
Evercore. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data that
existed on or before September 13, 2022, the day before Evercore rendered its oral opinion to our board of directors, and is not necessarily indicative of
current market conditions.
 
49
Table of Contents
For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial conditions, industry sector
performance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond our control. The estimates
contained in Evercore’s analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by Evercore’s analyses
and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect
the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s
analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The following summary of Evercore’s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the
analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a
complete description of Evercore’s financial analyses. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore’s
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such
analyses.
Summary of Evercore’s Financial Analyses
Dividend Discount Analyses. Evercore performed dividend discount analyses to calculate the implied present value of the estimated dividends per
share, to be received by the holders of our common stock on a standalone basis, per the financial projections, to be distributed over the six months
ending December 31, 2022 and the fiscal years of 2023 through 2027, and the implied present value of estimated terminal values derived utilizing the
perpetuity growth rate method and the NTM exit multiple method. Evercore calculated an implied equity value per share range of our common stock as of
June 30, 2022 by discounting back to present value our projected total dividend payments to stockholders, per the financial projections, using mid-year
convention discounting and the terminal values calculated under the perpetuity growth rate method and the NTM exit multiple method. For each analysis,
Evercore utilized a cost of equity discount rate range (based on an estimated range of our cost of equity) of 9.0% to 11.0%.
Utilizing the perpetuity growth rate method, Evercore estimated terminal values based on varying cost of equity discount rates and perpetuity
growth rates, by applying perpetuity growth rates to the estimate of the 2027 dividend per share, per the financial projections. Evercore utilized a
perpetuity growth rate range of 3.5% to 4.5%, in each case based on its professional judgment and expertise. The dividend discount analysis utilizing the
foregoing approach resulted in an implied equity value per share range of $22.82 to $36.29.
Utilizing the exit multiple method, Evercore estimated terminal values based on exit multiples of the NTM AFFO per share estimate as of December
31, 2027, per the financial projections. Evercore utilized a NTM AFFO per share exit multiple range of 11.5x to 15.5x, in each case, based on its professional
judgment and expertise. The dividend discount analysis utilizing the foregoing approach resulted in an implied equity value per share range of $25.67 to
$35.03.

Selected Public Companies Trading Analyses. Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of the Company to corresponding
financial multiples and ratios for the following selected publicly traded companies in the triple-net lease REIT industry (which are referred to in this
section as the “selected companies”):
 
•
National Retail Properties, Inc.
 
50
Table of Contents
•
Spirit Realty Capital, Inc.
 
•
Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc.
Although none of these companies is directly comparable to the Company, Evercore selected these companies based on its professional judgment
because they are triple-net lease REITs with business characteristics that, for purposes of its analysis, Evercore considered similar to the business
characteristics of the Company.
For purposes of its analyses, for each of the selected companies and the Company, Evercore calculated:
 
•
price per share as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2023 AFFO per share (“Price/2023E AFFO”); and
 
•
total enterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus the sum of debt (net of cash), and other applicable adjustments such as
adjustments for preferred stock and minority interest) as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA (“TEV/2023E
Adjusted EBITDA”).
For each of the selected companies and the Company, Evercore reviewed, among other information, stock price to Wall Street research analyst
consensus as published by S&P Capital IQ (“SNL”) (“Street consensus”), estimated AFFO per share for calendar year 2023, and aggregate total
enterprise value to Street consensus estimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for calendar year 2023.
Financial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, public filings and other publicly available
information. For the Company, Evercore additionally calculated Price/2023E AFFO and TEV/2023E Adjusted EBITDA based on the financial projections.
The multiples and ratios for each of the selected companies were calculated using their respective closing prices on September 13, 2022 and were based
on the most recent publicly available information and Street consensus estimates as of September 13, 2022, which represents the closing price for shares
of our common stock and the selected companies’ common stock on the day prior to the rendering of Evercore’s opinion.
The results of these calculations were as follows:
 
Selected Companies
Price /
2023E
AFFO
TEV /
2023E

EBITDA
National Retail Properties, Inc.
13.7x
16.0x
Spirit Realty Capital, Inc.
11.2x
13.0x
Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc.
13.8x
13.4x
Based on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore (1) applied a Price/2023E AFFO
multiple reference range of 11.0x to 15.0x to our estimate of 2023 AFFO per share, as reflected in the financial projections, and (2) applied a TEV/2023E
Adjusted EBITDA multiple reference range of 13.0x to 16.0x to our estimate of 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, as reflected in the financial projections. Evercore
then derived corresponding ranges of implied equity values per share as set forth below, which Evercore compared to the proposed merger consideration
of $32.25 per share.

Share
Price / 2023E AFFO
$
24.62 - $33.57
TEV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA
$
25.58 - $35.30
In evaluating the selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market conditions
affecting the selected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected companies’ financial, business and operating characteristics.
Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of these analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, these analyses involve complex considerations and
judgments regarding many factors that could affect the relative values of the selected companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected companies.

Table of Contents
Other Financial Analyses. The analyses and data described below were presented to our board of directors for informational and reference
purposes only and did not provide the basis for, and were not otherwise material to, the rendering of Evercore’s opinion.
Precedent Transaction Analysis. Evercore reviewed publicly available information related to selected precedent acquisition transactions involving
the triple-net lease REIT industry announced since 2012. Based on the multiples it derived from the selected precedent transactions and based on its
professional judgment and experience, Evercore selected a reference range of one calendar-year forward AFFO per share multiples of 13.0x to 15.0x.
Evercore then applied the multiple reference ranges to our estimate of 2023 AFFO per share, as reflected in the financial projections, and derived
corresponding ranges of implied equity values per share of our common stock of $29.09 to $33.57.
Premiums / Discounts to Net Asset Value. For the Company and each of the selected companies, Evercore reviewed stock price premiums and
discounts to the Street consensus estimate of net asset value (“NAV”) per share. Based on the premiums and discounts derived for the Company and the
selected companies, and its professional judgement and experience, Evercore applied a range of premiums to the Street consensus estimate of NAV per
share, as of September 13, 2022, for the Company to derive an implied per share equity value. Evercore selected a range of premiums of 0% to 15% and
derived corresponding ranges of implied equity values per share of our common stock of $28.96 to $33.30. Additionally, Evercore evaluated the proposed
merger consideration of $32.25 relative to the estimate of Green Street of our NAV per share, as of September 13, 2022, of $24.85.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets. Evercore reviewed selected publicly available stock price targets of research analysts’ estimates known to
Evercore as of September 13, 2022, the day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to our board of directors, for shares of our common stock. As
of September 13, 2022, the range of selected equity research analyst price targets per share of our common stock was $25.00 to $37.00. The mean price
target of research analysts’ estimates known to Evercore, as of September 13, 2022, was $31.32 per share and the median price target, as of the same date,
was $31.00 per share. Public market price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for shares
of our common stock, and these target prices and the analysts’ earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties,
including factors affecting our financial performance and future general industry and market conditions.
52-Week Trading Range. Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of our common stock during the 52-week period ended September 13,
2022, noting that the low and high intraday prices during such period ranged from $24.48 to $36.13 per share of our common stock, respectively.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of Evercore’s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by
Evercore to our board of directors. In connection with the review of the merger by our board of directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible
to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering the analyses as a
whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the
results of all of the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of
its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and experience after considering the results of
all of the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have
deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the
 
52
Table of Contents
view of Evercore with respect to the actual value of the shares of our common stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not
equaling the total of the figures shown. Further, Evercore’s analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies used, including judgments and
assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of the Company or its advisors.
Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to our board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the merger consideration to be received by holders of our common stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates). These
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which such business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates
contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested
by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and
Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such estimates.
Evercore’s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of our board of directors (in its capacity as
such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger. The issuance of Evercore’s opinion was approved by an opinion committee of Evercore.
Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to our board of directors or management or that any specific amount of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the merger for the holders of our common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of our engagement letter with Evercore, we have agreed to pay Evercore an aggregate transaction fee that is estimated, based
on the information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $31 million, of which $3 million was payable upon the delivery of
Evercore’s opinion, and the balance of which will become payable upon the consummation of the merger. We have also agreed to reimburse Evercore for
its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify Evercore against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates provided financial advisory or other services to us, for which
Evercore and its affiliates earned capital markets fees and commissions of less than $1.0 million. During the two-year period prior to the date of its
opinion, Evercore and its affiliates provided financial advisory or other services to GIC, for which Evercore and its affiliates received fees of less than
$47.0 million, and none of which fees related to the merger or involved the Company. During the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore
and its affiliates provided financial advisory or other services to Blue Owl, for which Evercore and its affiliates earned capital markets fees and
commissions of less than $2.0 million, and none of which fees related to the merger or involved the Company. Evercore or its affiliates may provide
financial advisory or other services to the Company, Parent, GIC, Oak Street and/or Blue Owl in the future, and in connection with any such services
Evercore or its affiliates may receive compensation.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of customers, including corporate
finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In
connection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in
which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect
transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial
instruments of or relating to the Company, Parent and its affiliates, GIC, potential parties to the merger and their respective affiliates or persons that are
competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates.

recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides fairness opinions in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and
valuations for corporate and other purposes.
Opinion of Goldman Sachs
Pursuant to an engagement letter, dated July 27, 2022, we engaged Goldman Sachs to act as our financial advisor in connection with the merger. At
a meeting of our board of directors held on September 14, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered to our board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in its written opinion, dated September 15, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $32.25 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated September 15, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with Goldman Sachs’ opinion, is attached as Exhibit C to this
proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and opinion were provided for the
information and assistance of our board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger and the opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of shares of our common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:
 
•
the merger agreement;
 
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five years ended December 31, 2021;
 
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company;
 
•
certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders;
 
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
 
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by our
board of directors, which are referred to herein as the “financial projections” (as defined and summarized above in the section entitled “—
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”).
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of our senior management regarding their assessment of our past and current business
operations, financial condition and future prospects, reviewed the reported price and trading activity for shares of our common stock, compared certain
financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded,
reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the real estate investment industry, and performed such other studies and
analyses and considered such other factors, including Sections 2.3(a) and 5.1(b)(ii) of the merger agreement, as Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of our board of directors, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs,
without assuming any
 
54
Table of Contents
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of our board of directors that the financial
projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of our management. Goldman Sachs did
not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of our or any of our subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-
balance-sheet assets and liabilities) and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained without any adverse effect
on the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed that the merger would be consummated on the
terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful
to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger, or the relative merits of the
merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting
matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from third parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business
combination with, the Company or any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to
the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock, as of the date of its opinion, of the $32.25 in cash per share of common
stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs does not express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any
other term or aspect of the merger agreement or merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement
or entered into or amended in connection with the merger, including, the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith
by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of our officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons, in connection with the merger, whether
relative to $32.25 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of our common stock would
trade at any time, or as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the merger, or as to the
impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations
when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or
reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of the opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and its
opinion were provided for the information and assistance of our board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger and such opinion
does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of our common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to our board of directors in connection with Goldman
Sachs’ rendering to our board of directors the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared, using publicly available data obtained from SNL, certain
financial information for the Company to corresponding financial information and public market multiples for the selected publicly traded REITs listed
below in the net-lease segment (which are referred to in this section as the “selected companies”). Although none of the selected companies is directly
comparable to the Company, the selected companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of
analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of the Company.
For each of the Company and the selected companies, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared:
 
•
the closing price per share, on September 13, 2022, as a multiple of the NTM AFFO for such company (the “Current P/NTM AFFO”);
 
•
the average of each company’s historical price to NTM AFFO multiples for the one year and five years ended September 13, 2022 (the “Last
1 Year Average P/NTM AFFO” and the “Last 5 Years Average P/NTM AFFO,” respectively); and
 
•
the median of each of the selected companies’ average price to NTM AFFO multiples for such periods.
The multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs for the Company and the selected companies are as follows:

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present
values per share of our common stock, based on theoretical future prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for our common stock.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share of our common stock as of December 31 of each of 2023, 2024 and 2025 by
applying illustrative price to NTM AFFO multiples ranging from 11.5x to 15.5x to estimates of our AFFO per share for each of fiscal years 2024, 2025, and
2026, respectively, as reflected in the financial projections. By applying a discount rate of 9.0%, reflecting an estimate of our cost of equity, Goldman
Sachs discounted to present value, as of June 30, 2022, and summed both the
 
57
Table of Contents
theoretical future values per share of common stock it derived for each applicable year and the estimated dividends to be paid per share of common stock
on a stand-alone basis through the end of the applicable year as reflected in the financial projections, to yield illustrative present values per share of our
common stock ranging from $25.33 to $34.41.
The illustrative price to NTM AFFO multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by Goldman Sachs using its professional judgement and
experience, taking into account the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under “—Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.”
Goldman Sachs derived the discount rate used in the foregoing analysis by application of the capital asset pricing model (“CAPM”), which requires
certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the U.S. financial markets generally.
Illustrative Levered Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the financial projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative levered discounted
cash flow analysis on the Company to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of our common stock.
Using discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%, reflecting estimates of our cost of equity, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative present
values per share of our common stock, by discounting to present value as of June 30, 2022, (1) the estimates of the levered free cash flow to be generated
by the Company for the period from July 1, 2022 to December 31, 2027, as reflected in the financial projections, and (2) a range of illustrative terminal
values for the Company as of December 31, 2027, calculated by applying a range of terminal year multiples of 11.5x to 15.5x to our estimated terminal year
AFFO, as reflected in the financial projections (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from (0.5)% to 3.4%). Goldman Sachs derived such
discount rates by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial
metrics for the U.S. financial markets generally. The range of terminal year multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment
and experience, taking into account the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under “—Selected Publicly Traded Companies
Analysis.”
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative present values per share of our common stock by adding the ranges of present values it calculated for
the levered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described above, and then dividing the result by the implied total number of fully diluted
shares of common stock estimated to be outstanding as of September 13, 2022, calculated based on equity information provided by our senior
management. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative present values per share of our common stock of $25.10 to $34.75.
Premia Paid Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the premia paid in all-cash acquisition
transactions of publicly traded REITs in the United States announced since 2017 through September 13, 2022 with a transaction value of greater than $1
billion.
For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the minimum, 25th percentile, median, mean, 75th percentile
and the maximum premia of the price paid in these transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to the announcement of
the transaction. This analysis indicated a minimum premium of 5.1%, a 25th percentile premium of 15.4%, a median premium of 22.4%, a mean premium of
29.5%, a 75th percentile premium of 30.3% and a maximum premium of 123.5%. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs then applied an illustrative premia
range of 15.4% to 30.3%, corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles premia described above, to the undisturbed closing price per share of our
common stock of $27.11 as of September 13, 2022, the day prior to the date of our board of directors’ approval of the merger, and calculated a range of
implied values per share of our common stock of $31.28 to $35.32.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without
 
58
Table of Contents
considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness
determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered
by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results
of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or the merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to our board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the $32.25 in cash per share of
common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon projections of future results are not necessarily indicative
of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently
subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company,
Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasts.
The consideration of $32.25 in cash per share of our common stock was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and
Parent and was approved by our board of directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to our board of directors during our negotiations with Parent in
connection with the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to our board of directors or
that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to our board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by our board of directors
in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion to our board of directors and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, attached as Exhibit C to this proxy statement.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment
management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and
employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any
time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including GIC and Oak Street, which have
(either directly or through an affiliate) entered into their respective equity commitment letters in favor of Parent and Merger Sub, and with respect to
certain obligations, the Company, in connection with the merger agreement, Blue Owl, their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, or
any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial
advisor to the Company in connection with, and have participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger. Goldman Sachs expects to receive
fees for its services in connection with the merger, the principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger, and we have agreed to
reimburse certain of its expenses arising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Goldman Sachs’ engagement.
Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which its
Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a joint book-running manager with respect to our

provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Blue Owl and/or its affiliates from time to time for which its Investment Banking
Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as joint bookrunner with respect to the public offering by Blue Owl

Sachs may also have co-invested with GIC, Blue Owl and their affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of
GIC and Blue Owl from time to time and may do so in the future.
We selected Goldman Sachs as our financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to the terms of our engagement letter with Goldman Sachs, we have agreed to pay Goldman
Sachs an aggregate transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $31 million,
of which $28 million is contingent upon completion of the merger. In addition, we agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities
under the federal securities laws.

Financing of the Merger
General
Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the merger, Parent expects to assume the non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes
outstanding under our STORE Master Funding debt program and the outstanding indebtedness under our public unsecured notes. Parent has also
informed us that it expects the outstanding indebtedness under our traditional non-recourse mortgage notes, unsecured revolving credit facility, private
placement unsecured notes and unsecured bank term loans to be prepaid or remain outstanding. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $2.3
billion in aggregate principal amount of consolidated secured indebtedness outstanding, including approximately $2.1 billion in non-recourse net-lease
mortgage notes and approximately $141.8 million in non-recourse mortgage notes. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $2.6 billion in
aggregate principal amount of consolidated unsecured indebtedness outstanding, including $223 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility,
$1.8 billion under our unsecured notes and $600 million under our unsecured bank term loans.
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be
approximately $10.8 billion, including the funds needed to:
 
•
pay an aggregate of approximately $9.1 billion to the holders of our common stock, including the holders of restricted stock and
performance units (other than excluded stock);
 
•
assume, repay or refinance our existing indebtedness in connection with the consummation of the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement; and
 
•
pay all fees, expenses and other obligations required to be paid or satisfied in connection with the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.
Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the following: (1) the equity financing in an aggregate amount of approximately
$8.2 billion; and (2) the debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $2.6 billion.
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition to the closing of the merger. We have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to
provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and customary in
connection with the arrangement of debt financing, the assumption of indebtedness and other transactions. For more information, see the sections
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Financing Cooperation” and “—Conditions to the Merger.”
Equity Financing
On September 15, 2022, an affiliate of GIC and Oak Street each entered into their respective equity commitment letters (together, the “equity
commitment letters”) with Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to which an affiliate of GIC and Oak Street committed to contribute (or cause to be
contributed) to Parent up to approximately $8.2 billion in cash in the aggregate (the “equity commitment”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the equity commitment letters. The equity commitments are subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others, the consummation
of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement substantially concurrently with or immediately following the funding of the equity commitment,
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the merger and the availability of the debt financing to be
funded at the closing.
In addition, an affiliate of GIC and Oak Street have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of their respective equity commitment letters, to
guarantee certain payment obligations of Parent, including the obligation to pay the Parent termination fee (as described in more detail under “The
Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”), certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations and certain obligations to pay our expenses and
costs (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) relating to any legal
 
61
Table of Contents
proceeding brought by us against Parent if Parent fails to pay the Parent termination fee or such expenses and costs, together with interest, if we prevail
in such legal proceeding (the “payment obligations”). The payment obligations of each of the Sponsors are subject to a cap in an amount equal to such
Sponsor’s specified percentage share of the Payment Obligations, if and when due pursuant to the merger agreement.
Debt Financing
Parent has informed us that it has received, in connection with the entry into the merger agreement, a debt commitment letter, originally dated as of
September 15, 2022 and amended as of September 30, 2022, from Column Financial, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (as the same may be amended
or supplemented pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, collectively with the related redacted fee letters, the “debt commitment letter”), providing
for the debt financing in an aggregate principal amount equal to $2.6 billion, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment
letter, and that it may seek to obtain additional debt financing in connection with the merger. The lenders’ obligations to provide the debt financing under
the debt commitment letter are subject to customary conditions, including, among others, the receipt of certain specified financial statements, the
execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the debt financing and the closing of the merger immediately prior to, or substantially
concurrently with, the funding of the debt financing. The debt commitment under the debt commitment letter expires on April 7, 2023, unless extended in
writing by the parties.
Equity Syndication
Following the no-shop period start date, the Parent Parties, the Sponsors and their respective affiliates, may, at Parent’s sole expense, solicit,
negotiate and enter into investment agreements with potential equity investors in Parent and/or a direct or indirect subsidiary or holding company of
Parent (the “equity syndication”). The merger agreement provides that no equity investor may be included, directly or indirectly, in the equity
syndication if the contemplated investment by such equity investor results or would be reasonably likely to result (other than, in each case, in de minimis
respects) in: (1) the imposition of new, or additional, conditions to the closing, diminution of the likelihood of the closing occurring, or adverse impact on
the debt financing, (2) any delay of the closing (including any delay in filing for, or obtaining, the CFIUS approval), or (3) any adverse impact on the
likelihood of receiving any required consents from any governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Subject to certain terms and conditions in the merger agreement, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and will cause each of our
subsidiaries and our and their respective representatives to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, to the Parent Parties cooperation reasonably
requested and customary in connection with the equity syndication. Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to reimburse us for any out-of-pocket costs
incurred by us and our subsidiaries in connection with the equity syndication and indemnify us and our subsidiaries and affiliates and representatives
from and against any and all documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements,
awards and liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the equity syndication and any information utilized in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the entry into or consummation of the equity syndication, the equity commitment letters will remain in full force and effect, and the
equity syndication will not in any way reduce or otherwise limit the aggregate commitment or any obligations or liability under the equity commitment
letters of the parties thereto.
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to approve the merger and the other proposals described above, our stockholders
should be aware that our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered
them, among other matters, in reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger, the merger agreement and
 
62
Table of Contents
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, the transaction committee, which was composed exclusively of non-employee,
independent directors, considered these interests, among other matters, in reaching its decisions related to the merger, the merger agreement and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including during executive sessions of the transaction committee without management
present. These interests are discussed below.
For purposes of this section, the “executive officers” include our current executive officers, Mary B. Fedewa, Sherry L. Rexroad, Chad A. Freed,
Craig A. Barnett, Tyler S. Maertz, Lori Markson and David Alexander McElyea and our former executive officers, Catherine Long and Christopher H. Volk.
Although Ms. Long and Mr. Volk are no longer executive officers of the Company due to their ceasing employment in November 2021 and December 2021,
respectively, we have included in this section information with respect to each of Ms. Long and Mr. Volk because they were executive officers during the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and will receive compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. This section does not include
information with respect to Einar A. Seadler because, while he was a member of our board of directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, he
left our board on February 17, 2022 and will not receive any compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger.
Treatment of Compensatory Awards
Restricted Stock. The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding award of restricted
stock granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and repurchase rights thereon will lapse,
and thereafter all shares of our common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and will
have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration, less required withholding taxes.
Performance Units. The merger agreement provides that, effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, outstanding awards of
performance units granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan will automatically become earned and vested as further described below under the
section entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits,” and thereafter will be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such
cancelled vested performance units will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive as of the merger effective time, in
consideration for the cancellation of such vested performance unit and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the merger
consideration and (2) the number of so-determined earned performance shares subject to such vested performance units, without interest, less required
withholding taxes. In addition, on the closing date, we will pay each holder of performance units an amount equivalent to all cash dividends that would
have been paid on the number of so-determined earned shares of our common stock subject to such performance units as if they had been issued and
outstanding from the date of grant up to, and including, the merger effective time, less required withholding taxes.
Value of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would become payable to each of our named executive
officers, see “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits” below. The estimated value of the payments that will be made to the executive officers
at the merger effective time in respect of their outstanding shares of restricted stock and performance units is approximately $31.0 million, which is based
on the aggregate number of shares of restricted stock and performance units held by the executive officers as of October 24, 2022. The estimated value of
the payments that will be made to our non-employee directors at the merger effective time in respect of their outstanding shares of restricted stock is
approximately $1.6 million, which is based on the number of shares of restricted stock held by the non-employee directors as of October 24, 2022. These
estimated values are based on the merger consideration of $32.25 per share and assume that all shares of restricted stock and performance units held by
the executive officers and non-employee directors as of October 24, 2022, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this filing, remain outstanding as
of the merger effective time and each of them does not receive any additional equity awards between such date and the merger effective time. In addition,
the estimate includes an amount equivalent to all

cash dividends that would have been paid on the number of earned shares of common stock subject to the performance units as if such shares had been
issued and outstanding from the date of grant up to, and including, the merger effective time.
Employment Agreements
We are party to an employment agreement with each of our current executive officers, which provide for the severance benefits described below in
the event of certain terminations of employment or a change in control of the Company. The severance benefits payable to each executive officer will be
subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants described below. The following descriptions of the terms of the employment agreements with our
current executive officers are intended as a summary only and, with respect to our named executive officers, are qualified in their entirety by reference to
the employment agreements filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on
February 25, 2022, and the employment agreement that was filed as an exhibit to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022,
which was filed with the SEC on May 6, 2022.
Executive Severance Benefits. The employment agreements with the executive officers provide that, if the employment of an executive officer is
terminated by the Company without “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason” (each as defined in the applicable employment agreement), the
executive officer will be eligible to receive the following benefits in addition to the executive officer’s accrued obligations (as defined in the applicable
employment agreement):
 
•
an amount equal to the cash bonus at the target percentage for which the executive officer is eligible for the year in which the termination of
employment occurs, prorated for the portion of such year during which the executive officer was employed by the Company;
 
•
an amount equal to two times the sum of (1) the executive officer’s annual base salary in effect on the date of the termination and (2) the
greater of (a) the average cash bonus received by the executive officer for the last two completed fiscal years or (b) the cash bonus at the
target percentage (calculated on the basis of a full fiscal year) for which the executive officer was eligible during the last completed fiscal
year;
 
•
monthly reimbursement for COBRA health insurance for a period of 12 months following the executive officer’s termination of employment,
in an amount equal to (1) the monthly COBRA health insurance premium minus (2) the monthly health insurance premium the executive
officer would have paid under our health plan had the executive officer not terminated employment; and
 
•
accelerated vesting of all of the executive officer’s unvested shares of restricted stock.
Golden Parachute Excise Tax. The employment agreements with each of our executive officers provide that if the payments and benefits provided
to the executive officer in connection with the merger would be subject to an excise tax by reason of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, such benefits
and payments will be reduced to the extent necessary to prevent any portion of the executive officer’s merger-related payments and benefits from
becoming subject to such excise tax, but only if, by reason of that reduction, the net after-tax benefit received by the executive officer exceeds the net
after-tax benefit the executive officer would receive if no reduction was made. None of the employment agreements provide for indemnification or “gross-
up” payments for golden parachute excise tax liabilities.
Restrictive Covenants. Each employment agreement also contains customary restrictive covenants, including confidentiality, non-competition and
non-solicitation provisions, that apply during the term of the executive officer’s employment with the Company and for 12 months thereafter.

Value of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would become payable to each of our
named executive officers upon a severance-qualifying termination, see “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits” below.
Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
The merger agreement provides that from and after the merger effective time, the Surviving Entity will (and the Parent will cause the Surviving
Entity to) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the merger effective time is, or at any time prior to the merger effective time was, a trustee,
director or officer of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (each an “Indemnified Party”), for any and all costs and expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, which will be advanced as they are incurred; provided, that the Indemnified Party will have made an
undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification under the merger
agreement), judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or legal proceeding (whether civil or criminal) in which such Indemnified Party may
be involved or with which he or she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or as a participant other than as a named party, including
as a witness) (an “Indemnified Party Proceeding”), (1) by reason of such Indemnified Party being or having been such trustee, director or officer or
otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of us or any of our subsidiaries at, or at any time prior to, the merger effective
time or (2) arising out of such Indemnified Party’s service in connection with any other corporation or organization for which he or she serves or has
served as a trustee, director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of the Company (including in any capacity with respect to any
employee benefit plan) at, or at any time prior to, the merger effective time, in each of (1) or (2), whether or not the Indemnified Party continues in such
position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the merger effective time (including any
Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification
or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, subject to certain limitations set forth in the merger
agreement. Additionally, the Surviving Entity will (and the Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to) fulfill and honor in all respects our obligations
pursuant to specified agreements in effect as of the date of the merger agreement between the Company and any indemnified person and any
indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in our or our subsidiaries’ organizational
documents as in effect on the date of the merger agreement.
The parties have agreed not to terminate or modify the obligations described above regarding indemnification of indemnified persons in such a
manner as to adversely affect such indemnified persons, and such obligations must be assumed by any successor entity to the Surviving Entity as a
result of any consolidation or merger or transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of its properties and assets.
Subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, we will, effective at the merger effective time, extend coverage under our
officers’ and directors’ liability insurance by obtaining prepaid extended reporting period coverage for our existing officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance policies, or with other insurers on terms and conditions no less favorable to the insureds than such existing insurance, which provides
coverage for an aggregate period of six years from and after the merger effective time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the merger effective time; provided, however, neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity will be obligated to pay an aggregate amount for such
extended reporting insurance in excess of 300% of the amount per annum that we paid for such insurance in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (the
“maximum amount”). If the aggregate amount for such extended reporting insurance would exceed the maximum amount, then we will obtain the most
advantageous such insurance available at an aggregate amount equal to the maximum amount. We will reasonably cooperate with and consult Parent
prior to the purchase of such insurance.

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information
about certain compensation for each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. Solely for purposes of the table
below, it is assumed that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination immediately following the merger effective time. In
addition, while Ms. Long and Mr. Volk no longer serve as executive officers of the Company, they are required to be included in the table below pursuant
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments described below, see the discussion under “—Interests of Our
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” above.
The following table sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that may be paid or become payable to each of our named executive officers in
connection with the merger pursuant to all applicable compensation plans or agreements, assuming that the merger effective time occurred on February 1,
2023, which is the earliest date the closing will take place (unless otherwise agreed in writing by Parent) and the assumed date of the merger effective time
solely for purposes of this merger-related compensation disclosure and that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination
immediately following the merger effective time. The amounts in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below, and do not reflect any reduction in payments pursuant to the
employment agreements to the extent necessary to prevent any portion of each named executive officer’s merger-related payments and benefits from
becoming subject to excise tax by reason of Section 4999 of the Code. The actual value to be received by our named executive officers may be greater or
less than the amounts presented below.

For our current executive officers, this figure represents the prorated cash bonus and cash severance payment in accordance with the employment
agreements. The aggregate amount is payable to each of the named executive officers in a single lump sum no later than 62 days after the
executive’s employment termination date. The amounts included in this column with respect to the prorated cash bonus and the cash
 
66Table of Contents
severance payment are conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment, whether or not in connection with a change in control. The cash
severance payment, as further described above under the section entitled “—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Employment Agreements,” is an amount equal to two times the sum of (a) the executive officer’s annual base salary in effect on the date of the
termination and (b) the greater of (i) the average cash bonus received by the executive officer for the last two completed fiscal years or (ii) the cash
bonus at the target percentage (calculated on the basis of a full fiscal year) for which the executive officer was eligible during the last completed
fiscal year.
The amounts set forth in the table below are the estimates of the prorated cash bonus and cash severance payment that each named executive
officer will receive. For purposes of this table, (a) the prorated cash bonus is based on each executive officer’s target cash bonus for 2022 and (b)
the cash severance payment is based on each executive officer’s base salary for 2022 and the average of (x) the executive officer’s cash bonus for
2021 and maximum cash bonus for 2022.

The treatment of compensatory awards at the merger effective time is a “single-trigger” benefit contingent upon the occurrence of the merger.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement (a) performance units that were granted in 2020 will vest with respect to approximately 53% of the
maximum number of shares of our common stock subject to the award, (b) performance units that were granted in 2021 will vest with respect to 50%
of the maximum number of shares of our common stock subject to the award, and (c) performance units that were granted in 2022 will vest with
respect to approximately 33% of the maximum number of shares of our common stock subject to the award. The amounts set forth in the table above
and the table below are estimates of the value each named executive officer will receive in respect of his or her outstanding compensatory awards.
These estimates assume that all shares of restricted stock and performance units held by each named executive officer as of October 24, 2022, the
latest practicable date prior to the date of this filing, remain outstanding as of the merger effective time, that each named executive officer does not
receive any additional compensatory awards between such date and the merger effective time, and disregards any vesting of compensatory awards
that may occur prior to the merger effective time. These amounts were calculated based on the number of shares subject to the portion of the award
that would accelerate and the merger consideration of $32.25 per share. In addition, the estimates include an amount equivalent to all cash
dividends that would have been paid on the number of earned shares of common stock subject to the performance units as if such shares had been
issued and outstanding from the date of grant up to, and including, the merger effective time. For further details regarding the value of accelerated
compensatory awards, see “—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Compensatory Awards” above.

This amount represents the estimated payments the Company will reimburse for each of our current executive officers with respect to premiums
under COBRA for health benefits for 12 months following the named executive officer’s termination of employment, such that the cost of health
benefits premiums to the executive would be limited to the amount the executive would have paid under our health plan had the executive officer
not terminated employment. The value of the perquisites/benefits reported in this column assume that such coverage continues for the full 12
months.
The amounts included in this column are conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment, whether or not in connection with a change in
control. For further details regarding the perquisites and benefits, see “—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Employment Agreements” above.

The total amounts do not reflect any reductions to “parachute payments” (as defined by Section 280G of the Code) pursuant to each named
executive officer’s employment agreement, that may be economically beneficial to the named executive officers in order to avoid the excise tax
imposed on individuals receiving excess parachute payments under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.
(5)
Ms. Long retired from her positions effective November 8, 2021 and left the employment of the Company effective November 12, 2021.
(6)
Mr. Volk, our former Chief Executive Officer, became Executive Chair effective April 15, 2021. His employment with the Company and service as a
member of our board of directors terminated effective December 27, 2021.
Regulatory Matters
Unless Parent agrees otherwise, the merger will not be completed until the parties have obtained the CFIUS approval. We are unaware of any other
material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required for the execution of the merger agreement or the completion of the
merger, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland, and
the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
Litigation Related to the Merger
As of November 3, 2022, three lawsuits have been filed by purported stockholders of the Company in connection with the merger. On October 28,
2022, October 31, 2022 and November 1, 2022, respectively, purported stockholders of the Company filed lawsuits against the Company and the current
members of our board of directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuits are captioned O’Dell v. STORE
Capital Corp. et al., No. 1:22-cv-09273 (filed October 28, 2022), Klein v. STORE Capital Corp. et al., No. 1:22-cv-09310 (filed October 31, 2022) and
Grossman v. STORE Capital Corp. et al., No. 1:22-cv-09357 (filed November 1, 2022).
The complaints generally allege, among other things, that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company in connection with the merger fails
to disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The alleged
omissions generally relate to (1) certain financial projections prepared by the Company, (2) certain financial analyses of the Company’s financial advisors
and (3) certain statements concerning the sales process. Plaintiffs in each pending lawsuit seek, among other things, an injunction barring the merger or,
in the alternative, rescission of the merger to the extent it is already implemented, and an award of damages.
Although the ultimate outcome of the matters cannot be predicted with any certainty, we believe that each of these lawsuits is without merit.
Additional lawsuits arising out of the merger may also be filed in the future.

STORE CAPITAL Corp_20221104_DEFM14A_20428387_4540170.Pdf,Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to common stockholders whose shares are
surrendered in the merger in exchange for the right to receive the merger consideration as described herein. This discussion is based on current law, is for
general information only and is not tax advice. This discussion is based on the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations, and administrative and judicial
interpretations thereof, each as in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change or to different interpretations, possibly with retroactive
effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. We have not requested, and do not
plan to request, any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), concerning our tax treatment or the tax treatment of the merger, and the
statements in this proxy statement are not binding on the IRS or any court. We can provide no assurance that the tax consequences contained in this
discussion will not be challenged by the IRS, or if challenged, will be sustained by a court.
This discussion does not address (1) U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes, (2) state, local or non-U.S. taxes, (3) tax reporting requirements, or
(4) withholding taxes under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as FATCA). This discussion assumes that
shares of our common stock are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does
not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances or to persons that
are subject to special tax rules and does not address the tax consequences of the merger to holders of restricted stock, performance units, or other awards
received as compensation. In addition, this discussion does not address the tax treatment of special classes of common stockholders, including, for
example:
 
•
banks and other financial institutions;
 
•
insurance companies;
 
•
regulated investment companies;
 
•
REITs;
 
•
tax-exempt entities or persons holding our common stock in a tax-deferred or tax advantaged account;
 
•
persons acting as nominees or otherwise not as beneficial owners;
 
•
mutual funds;
 
•
subchapter S corporations;
 
•
dealers in securities or currencies;
 
•
traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings;
 
•
persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
 
•
persons holding our common stock as part of a hedge or conversion transaction or as part of a “straddle” or a constructive sale;
 
•
U.S. expatriates;
 
•
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
 
•
holders that are subject to “applicable financial statement” rules under Section 451(b) of the Code;
 
•
holders who acquired our common stock as compensation;
 
•
holders that are properly classified as a partnership or otherwise as a pass-through entity under the Code;
 
•
non-U.S. governments;
 
69Table of Contents
•
qualified foreign pension funds, as defined in Section 897(l) of the Code;
 
•
qualified stockholders, as defined in Section 897(k) of the Code; and
 
•
“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax.
If any entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of its
partners or members generally will depend upon the status of the partner or member and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a
partnership or a member of a limited liability company or other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that entity is
holding our common stock, you should consult your tax advisor. Moreover, each holder should consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income
tax consequences to it of the merger in light of its own particular situation, as well as any consequences of the merger to such holder arising under the
laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.
For purposes of this section, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
•
a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state or political subdivision thereof;
 
•
a trust (1) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and with respect to which one or more “United
States persons” (as defined under the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions or (2) that has a valid election in effect
under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person; or
 
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.
As used in this section, a “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is not a U.S. holder or an entity treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not binding on the IRS. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not
assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any described herein.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RULES APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER AND DISPOSING OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND TO REITS
GENERALLY ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND COMPLEX. HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS
REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL,
STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS, AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS, IN LIGHT OF THEIR
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
Tax Treatment of the Merger
The merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a taxable sale by the Company of all of
its assets to Merger Sub in return for the merger consideration and the assumption of the Company’s liabilities, followed by a deemed liquidation of the
Company under Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code. We will be deemed to have distributed the merger consideration to our stockholders in
connection with the deemed liquidation. The liquidating distribution will be treated as a dividend for purposes of the dividend paid deduction to the
extent of our earnings and profits and thus will be sufficient to satisfy our requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income for the taxable year of
the merger.

Table of Contents
Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Our Common Stock
General
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for their shares pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of our common stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between:
 
•
the amount of cash received in exchange for our common stock; and
 
•
the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common stock.
Gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of shares, with a block consisting of shares acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction. Assuming that the shares constitute capital assets in the hands of the U.S. holders, this gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the merger the shares have been held for more than one year. An individual U.S. holder will be subject
to tax on net capital gain at a reduced maximum U.S. federal income tax rate (20% under current law). Additionally, a 3.8% Medicare unearned contribution
tax will apply to any gain recognized by individuals, trusts and estates whose income exceeds certain threshold levels. Capital gains of corporate U.S.
holders generally are taxable at the regular tax rate applicable to corporations. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized in the exchange is subject to
limitations under the Code. In addition, the IRS has the authority to prescribe, but has not yet prescribed, regulations that would apply a tax rate of 25%
to a portion of capital gain realized by a non-corporate stockholder on the sale of REIT shares that would correspond to the REIT’s “unrecaptured section
1250 gain.”
Special Rule for U.S. Holders Who Have Held our Common Stock for Less than Six Months
A U.S. holder who has held our common stock for less than six months at the time of the merger, taking into account the holding period rules of
Sections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss on the exchange of our common stock in the merger, will be treated as recognizing a
long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received from us, or such holder’s share of any designated retained capital gains, with
respect to such shares.
Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Our Common Stock
General
The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to a non-U.S. holder will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt of the
merger consideration is treated as a distribution from us to our stockholders that is attributable to gain from the sale of “United States real property
interests.” The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it intends to (1) take the position that under current law, unless an exception applies, a non-U.S.
holder’s receipt of a liquidating distribution from a REIT (which would include the receipt of cash in exchange for Company shares in the merger, which,
as noted above, will be treated as a deemed liquidation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is generally subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to
the extent attributable to gain from the sale of United States real property interests and (2) issue regulations that will be effective for transactions
occurring on or after June 13, 2007, clarifying this treatment. As a result, the following paragraphs provide alternative discussions of the tax
consequences that would arise to the extent the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 does or does not apply. Notwithstanding the discussion in the
following paragraphs, we intend to take the position that the cash received in exchange for our common stock will be subject to tax in accordance with
Notice 2007-55, subject to the 10% exception described below. In general, the provisions governing the taxation of distributions by REITs can be less
favorable to non-U.S. holders than the taxation of sales or exchanges of REIT shares by non-U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the application of these provisions.

Distribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests
To the extent the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and to the extent cash received by non-U.S. holders in the merger is attributable
to gain from the deemed sale of our United States real property interests (which we expect to be a substantial portion of such cash), then, subject to the
10% exception described below, such amount will be treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S.
holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and the non-U.S. holder would generally
be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return reporting such income). A corporate non-U.S. holder will also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax
(or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty). In addition, 21% of any such amounts paid to a non-U.S. holder will be
required to be withheld and remitted to the IRS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a non-U.S. holder has not owned more than 10% of our common stock
at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the merger and our common stock is treated as “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable
Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market located in the United States, the tax treatment described above would not apply, in which case
we intend to take the position that such non-U.S. holder would instead be subject to the rules described below in the section entitled “—Taxable Sale of
Our Common Stock.” We believe that our common stock is, and will be at the effective time of the merger, treated as regularly traded on an established
securities market in the United States.
Taxable Sale of Our Common Stock
To the extent the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 does not apply (or, in the event a holder qualifies for the 10% exception described above),
then subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a non-U.S. holder should not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on any gain or loss
from the merger unless: (1) the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if an
applicable income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States; (2) the
non-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other requirements are met;
or (3) such shares constitute “United States real property interests” in the non-U.S. holder’s hands under FIRPTA.
A non-U.S. holder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States will generally be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and the non-U.S. holder would generally be required to file a U.S.
federal income tax return reporting such income). In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such
lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described in clause (1) of the previous paragraph.
A non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and who meets certain
other requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the merger, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. In addition, the
non-U.S. holder may be subject to applicable alternative minimum taxes.
If a non-U.S. holder’s shares constitute United States real property interests under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by such holder in the merger will
be treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and the non-U.S. holder would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return
reporting such income). A non-U.S. holder’s shares of common stock generally will not constitute U.S. real property interests if either (1) we are a
“domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the merger effective time, or (2) both (a) shares of our common stock are treated as regularly
traded on an established securities market at the date of the merger and (b) the non-U.S. holder has held 10% or less of the total fair market value of that
class of shares at all times during the shorter of (i) the five-year period ending with the effective time of the merger and (ii) the non-U.S. holder’s holding
period for the shares. As discussed above,
 
72
Table of Contents
we believe that our common stock will be regularly traded on an established securities market. A “qualified investment entity” includes a REIT. Assuming
we qualify as a REIT, we will be a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the merger effective time if non-U.S. holders held directly or
indirectly less than 50% in value of our stock at all times during the five-year period ending with the merger effective time. While we believe that we have
been and currently are “domestically controlled” as of the date of this proxy statement, no assurances can be given that the actual ownership of our
shares has been or will be sufficient for us to qualify as a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the merger effective time.
Income Tax Treaties
If a non-U.S. holder is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States, the non-U.S. holder may be able to reduce or
eliminate certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above, such as the branch profits tax. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax
advisor regarding possible relief under an applicable income tax treaty.
U.S. Withholding Tax
As described above, it is not entirely clear whether the receipt of the merger consideration by a non-U.S. holder will be treated as a sale or exchange
of our common stock (in the event Notice 2007-55 does not apply) or as a distribution from us that is attributable to gain from the deemed sale of our
United States real property interests in the merger (in the event Notice 2007-55 does not apply). Accordingly, we intend to withhold U.S. federal income
tax at a rate of 21% from the portion of the merger consideration that is, or is treated as, attributable to gain from the sale of United States real property
interests and paid to a non-U.S. holder unless such holder qualifies for the 10% exception described above.
A non-U.S. holder may be entitled to a refund or credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, with respect to any amount
withheld pursuant to FIRPTA; provided, that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding withholding tax considerations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, and information reporting may apply to the cash received pursuant to the exchange of our common
stock in the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a holder who:
 
•
in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on an
IRS Form W-9 or successor form;
 
•
in the case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes an applicable IRS Form W-8 or successor form; or
 
•
is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with other applicable rules and certification requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld under these rules may be credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability and may entitle the holder to a refund if required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Possible Legislative Changes—Possible Change in Tax Rates
This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of
the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences (including applicable
tax rates) different from those

Table of Contents
summarized above. We cannot assure you that a change in law, including the possibility of major tax legislation, possibly with retroactive application, will
not significantly alter the tax consequences (including applicable tax rates) that we describe herein. We have not sought and do not plan to seek any
ruling from the IRS with respect to statements made and the conclusions reached in the above discussion, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or
a court will agree with our statements and conclusions.
THE FOREGOING DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
MERGER AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. THEREFORE, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX

Common Stock
At the merger effective time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than
excluded stock) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration, without
interest. Each share of excluded stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and no consideration will be paid, nor will any right inure or be made with respect thereto in connection with or as a consequence of the merger. If
we declare and pay a dividend to holders of shares of our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the incurrence
of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the merger consideration will be decreased by an
amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend.
Restricted Stock
Effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding award of restricted stock granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan
will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and repurchase rights thereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of our common stock
represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger agreement and subject to the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the merger consideration, less required withholding taxes.
Performance Units
Effective immediately prior to the merger effective time, outstanding awards of performance units granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan will
automatically become earned and vested , as further described above in the sections entitled “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” and “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits,” and thereafter will be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder
of any such cancelled vested performance units will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive as of the merger effective
time, in consideration for the cancellation of such vested performance unit and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the
merger consideration and (2) the number of so-determined earned performance shares subject to such vested performance units, without interest, less
required withholding taxes. In addition, on the closing date, we will pay each holder of performance units an amount equivalent to all cash dividends that
would have been paid on the number of so-determined earned shares of our common stock subject to such performance units as if they had been issued
and outstanding from the date of grant up to, and including, the merger effective time, less required withholding taxes.

Prior to the merger effective time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to us, cash in an
amount sufficient in the aggregate to enable the exchange agent to make payments of the merger consideration to holders of shares of our common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time. At the merger effective time, Parent and/or Merger Sub will deposit with the Surviving Entity
cash in the amount necessary, together with the other funds of the Surviving Entity, to make the payments to the holders of restricted stock and
performance units, other than payments in respect of accrued and unpaid cash dividends to the holders of performance units, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Entity to make such payments through the Surviving Entity’s payroll within five business days after the merger effective time, or at such later
time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
Within five business days after the merger effective time, Parent and the Surviving Entity will cause the exchange agent to, in accordance with, and
as required by the exchange agent’s customary procedures, mail to each holder of record of certificates that, immediately prior to the merger effective time,
represented outstanding shares of our common stock, whose shares of common stock were converted into the right to receive or be exchanged for the
merger consideration, a form of letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates previously representing such shares
of common stock in exchange for payment therefor. Upon surrender to the exchange agent of such certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of a certificate
as described below), together with a properly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such certificates will promptly receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash to which such holder (or transferee) is entitled pursuant to the merger agreement. Exchange of book-entry shares or book-entry units
representing shares of our common stock will be effected in accordance with the exchange agent’s customary procedures with respect to securities
represented by book entry.
If any certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the exchange agent and the taking of such actions as may be reasonably requested
by the exchange agent, including, if required by the Surviving Entity or the exchange agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount
as indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to such certificates, the merger consideration, as applicable, payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the merger agreement, the exchange agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the cash amount payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the merger agreement.
Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity, any affiliate thereof and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold,
or cause to be deducted and withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the merger agreement to any person such amount as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, and such amounts so deducted and withheld will be treated as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

effective time on our records. If, after the merger effective time, certificates representing such shares of common stock are presented to the Surviving
Entity for transfer, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in the merger agreement.
On or after the first anniversary of the merger effective time, the Surviving Entity will be entitled to cause the exchange agent to deliver to the
Surviving Entity any funds made available by Parent to the exchange agent which have not been disbursed to holders of certificates, and thereafter such
holders will be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Entity with respect to the cash amounts payable upon surrender of their certificates. Neither
the exchange agent nor the Surviving Entity will be liable to any holder of a certificate for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property or escheat law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of the certificates, book-entry shares or book-entry units
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any governmental entity will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,

defined below) has occurred and our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with our outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make a change in recommendation would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors
under applicable law. In addition, at any time prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, if we have not breached certain obligations under the merger
agreement (other than, in the case of certain obligations, any breach that has a de minimis effect), our board of directors may make a change in
recommendation and/or terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the

implementation of a superior proposal in response to (1) after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the cut-off time, an acquisition proposal from
an excluded party or (2) after the no-shop period start date, an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal that, in each case of clauses (1) and (2),
our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with our outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes a superior proposal and that, in light of such acquisition proposal, a failure to make a change in recommendation and/or to cause us
to terminate the merger agreement would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law, after having complied (other than
any non-compliance that has a de minimis effect) with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to the merger
agreement, and such acquisition proposal is not withdrawn.
Our board of directors may make a change in recommendation and/or terminate the merger agreement in accordance with the foregoing paragraph if:
 
•
we have delivered to Parent a prior written notice (a “notice of change in recommendation”) that includes a statement that our board of
directors intends to take such action, the identity of the person or group of persons making the superior proposal, as applicable, and the
material terms and conditions of the superior proposal or intervening event, as applicable, that is the basis of such action, including, if
applicable, copies of any written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements related to the superior proposal, as applicable (it
being agreed that the delivery of the notice of change in recommendation will not constitute a change in recommendation);
 
•
during the five business day period following Parent’s receipt of the notice of change in recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m., Eastern
time, on such fifth business day (a “notice of change period”), we have made our representatives reasonably available for the purpose of
engaging in negotiations and have negotiated, and have caused our representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) regarding such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, so that, in the case of a
superior proposal, such superior proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal, or, in the case of an intervening event, in order to
obviate the need to make such change in recommendation; and
 
•
after the expiration of the notice of change period, our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and after taking into account any changes to the merger agreement
that the Parent Parties have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by the third bullet point
above or otherwise, that (1) in the case of an acquisition proposal, the superior proposal giving rise to the notice of change in
recommendation continues to constitute a superior proposal and the failure to make a change in recommendation and/or enter into such
alternative acquisition agreement would be inconsistent with the duties of our board of directors under applicable law and (2) in the case of
an intervening event, the failure of our board of directors to effect a change in recommendation would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable law.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “intervening event” means any material change in circumstances that, in each case, occurred or arose after
the date hereof that materially affects the business, assets or operations of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which (1) was not known to or
reasonably foreseeable by, or, if known, the material consequences of which were not known to or reasonably foreseeable by, our board of directors prior
to the execution of the merger agreement and (2) becomes known to our board of directors prior to the stockholder approval; provided, however, that
none of the following will constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been, an intervening event: (a) the receipt of, or the existence or
terms of, an acquisition proposal or acquisition inquiry or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof; (b) any matter relating to the Parent Parties,
the Sponsors or their respective affiliates; or (c) the fact that, in and of itself, we meet or exceed any internal or public projections or forecasts or estimates
of revenues, earnings or other financial results for any period (provided, that the underlying causes thereof will not be excluded by this clause (c)).

Table of Contents
Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such a superior proposal will require a new notice of change in
recommendation, and we will be required to comply again with the requirements described above; provided, however, that the notice of change period
will be reduced to three business days following receipt by Parent of any such new notice of change in recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m., Eastern
time, on such third business day.
Nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits us, our board of directors or our representatives from:
 
•
taking and disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a “stop,
look and listen” statement pending disclosure of our or its position thereunder; provided, that any such disclosure does not contain an
express change in recommendation;
 
•
disclosing to our stockholders any factual information regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations or the fact that an
acquisition proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such acquisition proposal or the material terms of such acquisition
proposal, in each case, that our board of directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) is required under applicable law (it being understood that disclosure under this bullet will not limit or otherwise affect our
obligations or the obligations of our board of directors (or any committee thereof) under the merger agreement and no such disclosure will,
taken by itself, be deemed to be a change in recommendation); or
 
•
communicating in writing with any third party (or the representatives of such person) that makes any acquisition proposal or acquisition
inquiry to the extent necessary to direct such third party to the provisions of the merger agreement;
provided, however, that in the case of each of the three bullets above, (1) our board of directors will not make any change in recommendation except in
accordance with the provisions of the merger agreement and (2) any such statement or disclosure made by our board of directors (or a committee thereof)
pursuant to any of the foregoing three bullets will be subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and nothing in the foregoing three
bullets will be deemed to permit us or our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) to effect a change in recommendation.

however, that Parent will pay all filing fees payable in connection with obtaining the CFIUS approval. In the event that any party fails to obtain any such

of their respective affiliates to: (1) enter into any agreement or undertaking that requires the holding of direct or indirect equity interests of the Company
through proxy holders or in a voting trust; (2) diminish in any material respect the scope of Parent’s information rights with respect to the Company (other

proceedings with respect to the CFIUS approval). In addition, in connection with seeking the CFIUS approval, in no event will either Sponsor or its
affiliates be required to provide to any governmental entity any material non-public information with respect to itself or its affiliates or material non-public

actions necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened commencement of any legal proceeding, the issuance of
any order, or any other action, by or on behalf of CFIUS that would delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the merger

agreement providing for the sale, divesture, license, hold separate or other disposition, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the merger effective

employees, Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to (1) cause to

record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting, our stockholders who object to the merger do not have any
appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger. In addition, holders of our common stock may
not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in
connection with the merger because, as permitted by the MGCL, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such rights unless our
board of directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the board, determines that the rights apply. Our board of directors has made no such
determination. However, our stockholders can vote against the merger proposal.

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of September 15, 2022, by and among Ivory Parent, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), Ivory REIT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger
Sub” and, together with Parent, the “Parent Parties”), and STORE Capital Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the “Company”). Capitalized terms used
but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in Section 1.1.
RECITALS
A. The parties wish to effect a business combination in which the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger
Sub surviving the Merger pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the
“DLLCA”) and, pursuant to which each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”)
(other than the Excluded Shares (as defined below)) shall be converted into the right to receive cash as set forth herein, upon the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.
B. The board of directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) has unanimously (i) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions (as defined below), (ii) determined and declared that this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions
substantially upon the terms set forth in this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and directed that the
Merger be submitted for consideration at a special meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders of
Company Common Stock approve the Merger.
C. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as an inducement to each party’s willingness to enter into this Agreement,
an Affiliate (as defined below) of G Sponsor (as defined below) and OS Sponsor (as defined below), together with its affiliates, managed funds and
accounts, are each entering into an equity financing commitment letter in favor of the Parent Parties and, with respect to the guarantee of certain
obligations of the Parent Parties under this Agreement, in favor of the Company (together, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments
thereto as of the date of this Agreement, the “Equity Commitment Letters”), pursuant to which such entities have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, to invest in, or pay to, Parent the respective amounts set forth therein.
D. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as an inducement to each party’s willingness to enter into this Agreement,
the Parent has delivered an executed copy of (i) a commitment letter, dated as of September 15, 2022, among Parent and the Debt Financing Sources (as
defined below) party thereto (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, the “Debt Commitment Letter” and, together with the Equity
Commitment Letters, the “Financing Commitment Letters”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions therein, the Debt Financing

Financing Sources party thereto, related to the Debt Financing (as defined below) (collectively, the “Fee Letters” and, together with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the “Debt Financing Documents”; and the Debt Financing Documents, together with the Equity Commitment Letters, the “Financing
Commitments”), with the fee letters customarily redacted with respect to fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic provisions (including “flex”

Debt Financing Sources to reduce the amount of funding to be provided at and for the Closing under the Debt Financing from the amount set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, or the conditions on which such funding is available at Closing, in the case of each of the foregoing,

September 14, 2022
The Board of Directors
STORE Capital Corporation
8377 East Hartford Drive, Suite 100

Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that STORE Capital Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”), with Ivory Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), and Ivory REIT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity (the
“Transaction”). As a result of the Transaction, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company
Common Stock”), other than shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Transaction and then held by the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, or any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to receive $32.25 per share in cash (the “Merger
Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received
by holders of the Company Common Stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the Transaction is fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
 
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we deemed to be relevant;
 
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by management of the
Company, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Management Projections”);
 
(iii)
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of the Company, the current
financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Management Projections;
 
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;
 
(v)
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded
companies that we deemed relevant;
 
(vi)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated as of September 14, 2022, of the Merger Agreement, including the interim
operating covenants of the Company in the context of the potential closing date of the Transaction; and
 
(vii)
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information
publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent
verification of such information (and
 
B-1Table of Contents

STORE Capital Corporation

have not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further relied upon the assurances of the
management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With
respect to the Management Projections, we have assumed with your consent that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and the
other matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Management Projections or the assumptions on which they are based (including their views
on the risks and uncertainties of achieving the Management Projections).
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the final executed Merger Agreement will
not differ from the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by us, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are
true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all
conditions to the consummation of the Transaction will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. We have further assumed, in all respects
material to our analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will
be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the
Transaction or reduce the contemplated benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Transaction.
We have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and have not made or assumed any responsibility for
making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and
liabilities) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the
Company under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made
available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is
understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders of the Company
Common Stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates), from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration. We do not
express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection
therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature
of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative
to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term
or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Transaction, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Transaction, or any term or aspect of any
other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Our
opinion does not address the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the
Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction. In arriving at our opinion, we were not
authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any third party with respect to the acquisition of any or all of the Company Common Stock or any
business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of
Directors or to any other persons in respect of the Transaction, including as to how any holder of shares of the Company Common Stock should vote or
act in respect of the Transaction. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Company Common Stock will trade at any time, as
to the potential effects of volatility

in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the Transaction or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the
Company or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations when they come due. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have
assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which is
payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction. The Company has also
agreed to reimburse our expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two year period prior to the
date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have provided financial advisory services to the Company and received fees for the rendering of
these services. In addition, during the two year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have provided financial advisory
services to each of GIC and Blue Owl Capital Inc., affiliates of Parent, and certain of their respective affiliates, regarding matters unrelated to the Company
and received fees for the rendering of these services. We may provide financial advisory or other services to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates in the future, and in connection with any such services we may receive compensation.
Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for our and their own accounts and the accounts of customers,
including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity, placement agent, asset management and related
activities. In connection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and/or our or their respective employees, as well as
investment funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or
otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or
other financial instruments of or relating to the Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates or persons that are competitors, customers or
suppliers of the Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates.
Our financial advisory services and this opinion are provided for the information and benefit of the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in
connection with its evaluation of the proposed Transaction. The issuance of this opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore Group
L.L.C.
This opinion may not be disclosed, quoted, referred to or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except
with our prior written approval, except the Company may reproduce this opinion in full in any document that is required to be filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and required to be mailed by the Company to its stockholders relating to the Transaction.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of the
Company Common Stock (other than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates) in the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
 
Very truly yours,

Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (including, for these purposes, by taking no position
with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company’s stockholders) within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer; (vi) publicly propose or publicly announce an intention to take any of the foregoing actions (any action
described in clause “(i)” through clause “(vi)” being referred to as a “Change in Recommendation”); or (vii) approve, adopt, declare advisable or
recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, stock
purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other Contract (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in compliance with Section 5.2(a)) contemplating an Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Transactions (any such agreement, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) or otherwise resolve or agree to do so.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may: (i) make a Change in Recommendation if an

Table of Contents
Intervening Event has occurred and the Company Board (or an authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company
Board’s duties under applicable Law; or (ii) if the Company has not breached Section 5.2(e) or this Section 5.2(f) (other than, in the case of this Section
5.2(f) any breach that has a de minimis effect) and has not breached the other subsections of this Section 5.2 in any material respect, make a Change in
Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) in response to, (A) after the date hereof and prior to the Cut-Off Time, an
Acquisition Proposal from an Excluded Party, or (B) after the No-Shop Period Start Date, an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that, in
each case of clauses (A) and (B), the Company Board (or an authorized committee thereof) determines in the good faith, after consultation with the
Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal and that, in light of such Acquisition Proposal, a failure to make
a Change in Recommendation and/or to cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) would be inconsistent with the
Company Board’s duties under applicable Law, after having complied (other than any non-compliance that has a de minimis effect) with, and giving effect
to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to Section 5.2(g), and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn.
(g) The Company Board shall only be entitled to effect a Change in Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii) as permitted under Section 5.2(f) if: (i) the Company has delivered to Parent a prior written notice (a “Notice of Change in Recommendation”)
that includes a statement that the Company Board intends to take such action, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior
Proposal, as applicable, and the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, that is the basis of such
action, including, if applicable, copies of any written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements related to the Superior Proposal, as
applicable (it being agreed that the delivery of the Notice of Change in Recommendation by the Company shall not constitute a Change in
Recommendation); (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period following Parent’s receipt of the Notice of Change in Recommendation and ending at 11:59
p.m., Eastern time, on such fifth (5th) Business Day (a “Notice of Change Period”), the Company shall have made its Representatives reasonably
available for the purpose of engaging in negotiations and shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, or, in the case of an Intervening Event, in order to obviate the need
to make such Change in Recommendation; (iii) after the expiration of the Notice of Change Period, the Company Board (or an authorized committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and after taking into account any
changes to this Agreement that the Parent Parties have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (ii)
above or otherwise, that (A) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Change in Recommendation
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a Change in Recommendation and/or enter into such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s duties under applicable Law, and (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the
Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial terms
or any other material amendment of such a Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Change in Recommendation, and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.2(g); provided, however, that the Notice of Change Period shall be reduced to three (3)
Business Days following receipt by Parent of any such new Notice of Change in Recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on such third
(3rd) Business Day.
(h) The Company agrees that all references to the Company or the Company Board in this Section 5.2 shall include its Representatives, all
references to the Company in this Section 5.2, shall include the Company Board and any breach of this Section 5.2 (other than immaterial breaches) by the
Company Board or any Representatives of the Company or the Company Board will be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder; provided that any such disclosure does not contain an express

material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, in each case, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) is required under applicable Law (it being understood that disclosure under this clause (ii) shall not limit or otherwise affect

deemed to be a Change in Recommendation); or (iii) communicating in writing with any Third Party (or the Representatives of such Person) that makes

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare a proxy statement in preliminary
form for the Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the “Proxy
Statement”) and, after consultation with, and approval by, Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), file the preliminary
Proxy Statement with the SEC and Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation of the foregoing and shall

circulate amended or supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. The Company shall respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement; provided that, prior to responding to any comments of the SEC, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to consult and review such response and the Company shall consider in good faith any
comments on such response reasonably proposed by Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate, and shall cause their Affiliates to cooperate, with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including
promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates as may

contain the Company Board Recommendation, except to the extent that the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have effected a Change in
Recommendation, as permitted by and determined in accordance with Section 5.2. Parent shall ensure that such information supplied by it and its
Affiliates in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting or filed with the SEC (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
 
A-48Table of Contents
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response and shall consider Parent’s comments in good faith. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not on the
date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub or their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.
(b) If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers, trustees or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, which, pursuant to
the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other party hereto, and cooperate in the filing with the
SEC of an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by applicable Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company’s stockholders. All documents that the Company is responsible for filing with
the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. For purposes of Section 3.23, Section 4.12 and this Section 5.3, any information concerning or related to the Company, its
Affiliates or the Stockholders Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company and any information concerning or related to Parent or its
Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

Statement and (ii) the conclusion of any SEC review of the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Company’s Organizational Documents, duly set a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders

matters requiring stockholder approval; provided that the Company shall not be required to convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting prior to the No-
Shop Period Start Date; provided, further, that notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Stockholders Meeting after consultation with Parent (A) with the consent of Parent, (B) for the absence of a quorum, (C) to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock within a reasonable amount of time in

case of clause (C), excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law) and (y) one hundred twenty (120) days after the original
record date for the Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Company’s stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable upon the earlier of (i) receiving notification that the SEC is not reviewing the
preliminary Proxy Statement and (ii) the conclusion of any SEC review of the preliminary Proxy Statement. Unless the Company Board or any committee
thereof has withdrawn the Company Board Recommendation in compliance with Section 5.2, the Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend
to holders of the Company Common Stock that they vote in favor of the Merger so that the Company may obtain the Company Stockholder Approval
and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the

Company Stockholder Approval (including by soliciting proxies from the holders of the Company Common Stock and taking all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to proxy solicitation results
as reasonably requested by Parent. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 7, (i) the Company shall not submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the obligation of the Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting

respective Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting.

(ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain the CFIUS Approval; (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals required from
Third Parties in connection with the Transactions; and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other actions necessary

Section 5.4(c), (A) without the prior written consent of Parent, in no event shall the Company pay any fee, penalty or other consideration, make any
commitment or incur any Liability to any Person for any consent or approval in connection with the Transactions, and (B) in no event shall any of the
Parent Parties or any of their Affiliates be required to pay any fee, penalty or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any Liability to any
Person for any consent or approval in connection with the Transactions; provided, however, that Parent shall pay all filing fees payable in connection

reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company, Parent and their respective Affiliates and businesses that result, or which would
reasonably be expected to result, after the Merger Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.

investment in the Company (including any “portfolio company”, as such term is generally understood in the private equity industry, of either Sponsor or
their respective Affiliates, but not including the Acquired Companies); or (v) commence or participate in any action, suit or other Legal Proceeding (other
than regulatory proceedings with respect to the CFIUS Approval). In addition, in no event will either Sponsor or their respective Affiliates be required to
provide to any Governmental Entity in connection with seeking the CFIUS Approval any material non-public information with respect to itself or its
Affiliates or material non-public information with respect to its and its Affiliates’ portfolio holdings (including whether or not any such holdings exist),
other than material non-public information (x) required to be provided to CFIUS under the DPA or customarily requested by any such Governmental
Entity as part of seeking and obtaining approvals from CFIUS, and (y) which either Sponsor has previously provided in

cause such Sponsor to use its reasonable best efforts within the constraints imposed on it and its Affiliates by applicable Law and its and its Affiliates’
organizational documents and consistent with its and its Affiliates’ internal policies and past practices, to provide such information and, in the absence of
being able to provide such information, to enter into good faith discussions with the Company and the Government Entity to provide other information,
within the constraints imposed on it and its Affiliates by applicable Law and its and its Affiliates’ organizational documents and consistent with its and
its Affiliates’ internal policies and past practices, that attempts to address the topic(s) of inquiry then being made by such Governmental Entity.
(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, within one (1) day after the date hereof, the parties shall jointly contact the Staff Chairperson of CFIUS
to inform CFIUS of the Merger and the other Transactions, the identity of counsel to the parties and that a notice will be filed pursuant to the DPA. In
connection with obtaining the CFIUS Approval in accordance with the DPA, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to: (i) submit to CFIUS a draft
joint voluntary notice as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof); (ii) provide
any information requested by CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the Merger and the other
Transactions within the timeframes set forth in the DPA; and (iii) submit to CFIUS a final joint voluntary notice as promptly as practicable following the
date that CFIUS provides comments to the draft notice. In addition, the Parent Parties shall cooperate in good faith with CFIUS and use their reasonable
best efforts to undertake promptly any and all actions necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened
commencement of any Legal Proceeding, the issuance of any Order, or any other action, by or on behalf of CFIUS that would delay, enjoin, prevent,
restrain or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, including by (A) proffering and consenting and/or agreeing to
an Order or other agreement providing for the sale, divesture, license, hold separate or other disposition, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the

to proffer and consent and/or agree to any Order or other agreement providing for the sale, divesture, or other disposition, contemporaneously with or
subsequent to the Merger Effective Time, of any property or properties of the Acquired Companies, or effect any such sale, divestiture, or other
disposition of any property or properties of the Acquired Company to the extent that any such properties or properties required to be so sold, divested,

the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter, annual base rent and interest greater than 3.0% of the Company’s aggregate annual base rent and interest as of

Proceeding of an Order permitting the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions but requiring any of the properties of the Acquired
Companies to be sold, divested or disposed of thereafter shall not be deemed a failure to satisfy any condition specified in Article 6.
(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in Section 5.4(a), subject to applicable Law, each party shall: (i) give the other
parties prompt written notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of (and provide copies of) any communication to or from any
other Governmental Entity and keep the other parties reasonably informed regarding any substantive communications to or from a Third Party, in each
case regarding the Mergers or other Transactions. Each party hereto will have the right to review in advance, and each party will consult and cooperate
with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation,

Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted in writing to any
Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.
(e) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or Legal Proceeding is commenced challenging the Merger or
any of the other Transactions and such litigation, action or Legal Proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent the
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, the Parent Parties and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve any such
litigation, action or Legal Proceeding and each of the Parent Parties or the Company shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to contest any such litigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,

Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in the events set out in clauses

provision of access to information or personnel by electronic means if, and to the extent, physical access is not reasonably feasible as a result of COVID-
19 or any COVID Measures or would not be permitted under applicable Law. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall affect or be deemed to

(a) The Company shall bind, effective at the Merger Effective Time, extended coverage under the Company’s officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance by obtaining prepaid “tail”/extended reporting period coverage for the Company’s existing officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policies
(accurate and complete copies of which have been made available to Parent), or with other insurers on terms and conditions no less favorable to the
insureds than such existing insurance, which provides such Persons currently covered by such insurance with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6)
years from and after the Merger Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Merger Effective Time;
provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.9(a), neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to pay an
aggregate amount for such “tail” insurance in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date
hereof (the “Maximum Amount”) and if such aggregate amount for such “tail” insurance would exceed the Maximum Amount, then the Company shall
obtain the most advantageous “tail” insurance available at an aggregate amount equal to the Maximum Amount; provided, further, that the Company
shall reasonably cooperate and consult with Parent prior to the purchase of such “tail” insurance. If Parent can procure such “tail” insurance on superior
terms or on equivalent terms, with insurers of equal or better A.M. Best financial strength ratings and outlooks and with full continuity, but at a lower net
price, as compared to any such insurance that may be procured by the Company, then Parent may obtain such insurance bound and effective as of the
Merger Effective Time, in which case the Company shall not obtain such insurance. Should Parent wish to exercise this option to place the tail insurance,
it must both provide the Company with notice of its intent to exercise this option and provide the complete terms (including the runoff

endorsement) of all such proposed policies to the Company, no later than twenty-five (25) days prior to the Merger Effective Time for review and approval
by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). For clarity, any such insurance placed by Parent shall (i) not insure Parent, (ii) not
require any warranty or similar statements, and (iii) have full continuity for the pre-Merger Effective Time period. The Surviving Entity shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Entity to) maintain such insurance in full force and effect for its full term and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(b) From and after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify and
hold harmless each individual who at the Merger Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Merger Effective Time was, a trustee, director or officer of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (each an “Indemnified Party”) for any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses of legal counsel, which shall be advanced as they are incurred; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have made an undertaking to repay
such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.9(b)), judgments, fines,
penalties or liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with or arising out of any action, suit or Legal Proceeding (whether civil or criminal) in which such Indemnified Party may be involved or with
which he or she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or as a participant other than as a named party, including as a witness) (an
“Indemnified Party Proceeding”) (A) by reason of such Indemnified Party’s being or having been such trustee, director or officer of any of the Acquired
Companies or otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of any of the Acquired Companies at, or at any time prior to, the
Merger Effective Time, or (B) arising out of such Indemnified Party’s service in connection with any other corporation or organization for which he or she
serves or has served as a trustee, director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of the Company (including in any capacity with
respect to any employee benefit plan) at, or at any time prior to, the Merger Effective Time, in each of (A) or (B), whether or not the Indemnified Party
continues in such position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the Merger Effective
Time (including any Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any
other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that Parent and the
Surviving Entity shall not be (x) liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or (y) obligated under this Section 5.9(b) to pay the fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel (selected by a plurality of
the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single Legal Proceeding except to the extent that, on
the advice of any such Indemnified Party’s counsel, two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such Legal
Proceeding; and (ii) fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (1) each indemnification agreement set forth on Section
5.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and in effect as of the date hereof between the Company and any Indemnified Party; and (2) any
indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Acquired
Companies as in effect on the date hereof. Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by Indemnified Parties
in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided under this Section 5.9. Parent’s and the Surviving Entity’s obligations under the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from and after the Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that all
rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such claim.
(c) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Entity, then, and in each such case Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

that any such individual may have under any Organizational Documents, by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity
under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Indemnified

such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9). Nothing in
this Agreement, including this Section 5.9, is intended to, shall be construed to, or shall release, waive or impair any rights to any insurance claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Acquired Companies or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies, or impair or limit any other

the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes
closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event
such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
invalid or unenforceable term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the provisions set forth in Section 7.3(c), Section 8.1, Section 8.5,
Section 8.6, this Section 8.8, Section 8.11 and Section 8.12 (in each case as they relate to the Debt Financing Source Parties) shall be construed as an
integral provision of this Agreement and that such provisions shall not be severable in any manner that diminishes the rights or increases the liability of
any Debt Financing Source Party.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for
any such harm. The parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1 and any dispute over the right
to termination has been finally resolved, (i) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set
forth in Section 8.5 to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than the Parent
Parties obligation to effect the Closing, which shall be governed by the next sentence), without bond or other security being required, this being in
addition to any remedy to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions, including the Merger, and without that right, none of the Company or the Parent Parties would have entered into this Agreement. The
parties hereto further agree that unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1 and any dispute over the right to
termination has been finally resolved, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy to specifically
enforce the Parent Parties’ obligations to effect the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein in the event that (A) the conditions set forth in
Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided that each such condition is then
capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived and (B) the Debt Financing is available to be funded at the Closing and has been
funded or will be funded if the Equity Financing is funded, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, (C) Parent has failed
to consummate the Closing at the time when it was required under Section 2.3, and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if
specific performance were granted and the Debt Financing and Equity Financing were funded, then the Closing would occur in accordance with Section
2.3 (such clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), together, the “Specific Performance Conditions”). Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other of such parties has an adequate remedy at Law or that
any such injunction or award of specific performance or other equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy for any reason; provided that solely with
respect to the equitable remedy to specifically enforce the Parent Parties’ obligation to effect the Closing, the Parent Parties may oppose the granting of
specific performance only on the basis that one of the Specific Performance Conditions has not been satisfied. The parties hereto further agree that (x)
following the Company’s termination of this Agreement in

to enforce specifically the Parent Parties’ surviving obligations herein, including with respect to the payment of monetary damages under Section 7.2 or
the payments to which the Company is entitled under Section 7.3(c), and (ii) following Parent’s termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.1, Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 8.5 to enforce specifically the
Company’s surviving obligations herein, including with respect to the payment of monetary damages under Section 7.2 or the payment to which Parent is
entitled under Section 7.3(b); provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, while the Company may pursue a grant of specific
performance prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, following a termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to seek a grant of specific performance
to cause the Closing to occur.
(b) The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 8.11, a party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) for breach of any of the
provisions of this Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 8.11
are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 8.11 shall require any party to institute any Legal Proceeding for (or
limit any party’s right to institute any Legal Proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.11 prior to or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under Article 7 (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this
Section 8.11 or anything set forth in this Section 8.11 restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 7
or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other than the final sentence of this Section 8.11(c)), the maximum
aggregate Liability of the Parent Parties for monetary losses, damages, costs or expenses in connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letters and the Transactions shall be limited to an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Recovery Costs

in connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters or the Transactions or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or
in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise. In no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates seek nor shall the Company permit to be sought on behalf of the Company any monetary
damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, from any officer, director, agent or employee of the Parent Parties, any direct
or indirect holder of any equity interests or securities of the Parent Parties or any direct or indirect director, officer, employee, partner, Affiliate, member,

and subject to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters). Except for the liabilities and obligations of the parties to the Equity Commitment Letters, the
Debt Commitment Letter and any other agreements pursuant thereto under any of the foregoing agreements to which they are parties and except for

out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or the Transactions or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or
the Transactions or the negotiation, execution, performance, or breach of this Agreement (other than, in each case, the liabilities and obligations of the
parties to the Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter, and any other agreements pursuant thereto and under any of the foregoing

of itself and its Affiliates, hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such Non-Recourse Party.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, except as provided in the Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt
Commitment Letter and any other agreements pursuant thereto, (i) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands,
or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party

agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise;

representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters, in
connection with a valid Order requiring Parent to specifically perform the Closing of the Transactions under this Agreement, the Company may enforce
the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.11(c) and any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters (and without limiting the
Company’s remedies thereunder), the Company may seek to cause Parent to enforce the terms of such Equity Commitment Letters to cause the other
parties thereto to provide funds to Parent to permit Parent to satisfy (i) any Order or award of damages in favor of the Company obtained by the Company
in accordance with Section 7.2, and/or (ii) payment by Parent of the Parent Termination Fee, Parent Expenses and/or Recovery Costs, in each case, solely
to the extent provided therein and in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and for the avoidance of
doubt, (A) nothing in this Section 8.11(c) shall limit in any way the Company’s right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy in
accordance with Section 8.11(a), and (B) nothing in this Section 8.11 nor Section 7.3 shall limit in any way any fraud remedies or the remedies of the parties
