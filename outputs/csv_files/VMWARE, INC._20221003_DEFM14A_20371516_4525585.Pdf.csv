"VMWARE, INC._20221003_DEFM14A_20371516_4525585.Pdf",QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the
transactions, the merger agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all
questions that may be important to you as a VMware stockholder. Please refer to the section titled “Summary” and
the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, the annexes to this proxy
statement/prospectus and the documents referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus, which you should read
carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus without charge by following the instructions under the section titled “Where You Can Find
More Information.”
Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
A:
VMware, Inc. (referred to as VMware) is sending these materials to VMware stockholders to help them decide
how to vote their shares of VMware common stock with respect to (i) the adoption of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of May 26, 2022, by and among Broadcom Inc. (referred to as Broadcom), VMware, Verona
Holdco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of VMware (referred to as Holdco), Verona Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Holdco (referred to as Merger Sub 1), Barcelona Merger Sub 2, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Broadcom (referred to as Merger Sub 2) and Barcelona Merger Sub 3, LLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Broadcom (referred to as Merger Sub 3, and collectively, with Merger Sub 2, as Broadcom Merger
Subs), which agreement provides for the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom (such agreement, as it may be
amended from time to time, is referred to as the merger agreement), a copy of which is included as Annex A to
this proxy statement/prospectus, and approval of the first merger and the second merger (each as defined
below), (ii) the adoption of an amendment to VMware’s certificate of incorporation (referred to as the charter
amendment) to eliminate the personal liability of VMware’s officers for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as an officer, except to the extent such an exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (referred to as the DGCL) and (iii) the other proposals to be
considered at the special meeting of VMware stockholders to be held on November 4, 2022 (referred to as the
special meeting).
This document constitutes both a proxy statement of VMware and a prospectus of Broadcom. It is a proxy
statement because VMware is soliciting proxies from its stockholders. It is a prospectus because Broadcom will
issue shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (referred to as Broadcom common stock), in
exchange for shares of VMware Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (referred to as VMware
common stock or VMware shares) in the transactions (as defined below) if the transactions are completed.
Q:
What are the transactions?
A:
VMware has agreed to be acquired by Broadcom under the terms of the merger agreement, which is further
described in this proxy statement/prospectus. If the merger agreement is adopted by VMware stockholders and
the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, the following transactions
(collectively referred to as the transactions) will be consummated:
•
Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware (referred to as the first merger), with VMware surviving the
first merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco;
•
following the effective time of the first merger, VMware, the surviving company of the first merger, will be
converted into a Delaware limited liability company (referred to as the LLC conversion);
•
following the effective time of the LLC conversion, Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into Holdco (referred
to as the second merger), with Holdco surviving the second merger and becoming a wholly owned
subsidiary of Broadcom; and
•
following the effective time of the second merger, Holdco, the surviving company of the second merger, will
merge with and into Merger Sub 3 (referred to as the third merger), with Merger Sub 3 surviving the third
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Are there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the merger
agreement proposal?
A:
Yes. You should read and carefully consider the risks set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” beginning on
page 27. You should also read and carefully consider the risks related to Broadcom and VMware contained in the
documents that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.
Q:
What will I receive for my shares if the transactions are completed?
A:
Immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger, the merger consideration is subject to proration so
that 50% of VMware common stock issued and outstanding will be converted into cash consideration and 50%
will be converted into stock consideration.
At the effective time of the second merger, you will be entitled to receive, at your election and subject to
proration, for each share of VMware common stock that you hold (i) $142.50 in cash, without interest (referred to
as the cash consideration) or (ii) 0.25200 shares of Broadcom common stock (referred to as the stock
consideration and together with the cash consideration, the merger consideration). You will receive cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Broadcom common stock that you would otherwise be entitled to receive.
You may elect a different form of merger consideration for each share you own. You may elect to receive (i)
solely the cash consideration, (ii) solely the stock consideration or (iii) if you own more than one share, a
combination of the cash consideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the
remaining number of shares. Whether you receive your elected merger consideration will depend on the election
of other VMware stockholders and a proration mechanism. For example, if you elect to receive solely the cash
consideration or solely the stock consideration, and all other VMware stockholders make the same election, the
consideration you receive will vary to the maximum extent possible compared to your original election. In such
instance, you would receive the cash consideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware common
stock and the stock consideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware common stock. The following
examples illustrate the proration mechanism in the case of an oversubscription of either the cash consideration
or the stock consideration (both if you elect solely the oversubscribed form of merger consideration and if you
elect a combination of the cash consideration and the stock consideration). Note that for illustrative purposes,
the following examples do not round shares to the nearest whole number.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the cash consideration, and
80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect
to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,
you will receive cash in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common
stock in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 55 shares
and the stock consideration for 45 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive
cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the
outstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 34.375 of your
shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 65.625 of your shares of
VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the stock consideration, and
80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding
VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,
you will receive cash in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common
stock in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 45 shares
and the stock consideration for 55 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive
Broadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the
outstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 65.625 of your
shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 34.375 of your shares of
VMware common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The proration of the merger consideration will not be known until immediately prior to or following the effective
time of the second merger. VMware stockholders who do not make an election will be treated as having elected
to receive cash consideration or stock consideration in accordance with the proration methodology in the
merger agreement.
On May 25, 2022 (the last full trading day before the announcement of the transactions), the closing stock price
per share of Broadcom common stock was $531.63, which, after giving effect to the exchange ratio of 0.25200,
has an implied value of approximately $133.97 per share. Based on this price, with respect to the stock
consideration and the cash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the transactions, VMware
stockholders that receive the cash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock and receive
the stock consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock would receive total merger
consideration with an implied value of approximately $138.24 per share.
On September 30, 2022 (the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus),
the closing stock price per share of Broadcom common stock was $444.01, which, after giving effect to the
exchange ratio of 0.25200, has an implied value of approximately $111.89 per share. Based on this price, with
respect to the stock consideration and the cash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the
transactions, VMware stockholders that receive the cash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware
common stock and receive the stock consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock would
receive total merger consideration with an implied value of approximately $127.20 per share.
The implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Broadcom common stock
fluctuates because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Broadcom common stock.
As a result, the value of the stock consideration that VMware stockholders will receive upon completion of the
transactions could be greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus, at the time of the VMware special meeting or on the date on which VMware
stockholders make their election. Accordingly, you should obtain current stock price quotations for Broadcom
common stock and VMware common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to the merger agreement
proposal. Broadcom common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AVGO” and
VMware common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “VMW.”
For additional information regarding the consideration to be received in the transactions, see the section titled
“The Transactions-Merger Consideration.”
Q:
What happens if I am eligible to receive a fraction of a share of Broadcom common stock as part of the stock
consideration?
A:
If the aggregate number of shares of Broadcom common stock that you are entitled to receive as part of the
stock consideration otherwise would include a fraction of a share of Broadcom common stock, you will receive
cash in lieu of that fractional share. See the section titled “The Transactions-Exchange of Shares; Elections as to
Form of Consideration.”
Q:
How and when do I make my merger consideration election?
A:
You will receive an election form following the VMware special meeting. You will make your cash and/or stock
election by properly completing, signing and returning the election form. In addition, if you hold stock
certificates representing VMware common stock, you must return your stock certificates (or guaranty of delivery
of such certificates) to the exchange agent in connection with the transactions. If you do not send in the
election form with such stock certificates, if applicable, by the election deadline, you will be treated as though
you had not made an election. Carefully review and follow the instructions accompanying the election form. If
you own VMware common stock in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish
to make an election, you should follow the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee
when making your election.
The mailing of the election form will occur at least 20 business days prior to the anticipated election deadline,
which is expected to be 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the
3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
exchange agent is located) on the date that is five business days prior to Broadcom’s good faith estimate of the
closing date or such other date as may be mutually agreed to by the parties. Broadcom and VMware will publicly
announce the anticipated election deadline at least three business days prior to the election deadline.
Do NOT submit any stock certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) with your proxy card.
For more details on the election procedures, see “The Transactions-Exchange of Shares; Elections as to Form of
Consideration.”
Q:
What do I do if I want to revoke my election?
A:
You may change or revoke your election at any time during the election period, by written notice to the exchange
agent prior to the election deadline or by withdrawal of your VMware stock certificates (or of the guarantee of
delivery of such stock certificates), if applicable, previously deposited with the exchange agent prior to the
election deadline.
Q:
What happens if I do not make a valid merger consideration election?
A:
If you do not return a properly completed election form by the election deadline, your shares of VMware
common stock will be considered “non-election” shares and will be converted into the right to receive the cash
consideration or the stock consideration according to the allocation procedures specified in the merger
agreement. Generally, in the event one form of merger consideration (i.e., cash or shares of Broadcom common
stock) is undersubscribed (referred to as the undersubscribed consideration), “non-election” shares will be
allocated the undersubscribed consideration.
Q:
If I make a valid merger consideration election, could I receive a form of merger consideration that I did not
elect to receive?
A:
If, after the “non-election” shares have been allocated any undersubscribed consideration, there still remains
undersubscribed consideration, then shares of VMware common stock electing the oversubscribed form of
merger consideration will be allocated the undersubscribed consideration pursuant to the proration and
adjustment procedures. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that you will receive your elected form of merger
consideration for all of your shares of VMware common stock. In the event proration is necessary, electing
shares will be allocated the undersubscribed consideration only after the undersubscribed consideration is
allocated to “non-election” shares.
Q:
How will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled?
A:
After receiving the proper documentation from you, following the completion of the second merger, the
exchange agent will provide to you the cash consideration and/or stock consideration to which you are entitled.
More information on the documentation you are required to deliver to the exchange agent may be found in the
section titled “The Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
Q:
What will happen to VMware as a result of the transactions?
A:
If the transactions are completed, VMware, as the surviving corporation of the first merger, will be converted to a
limited liability company in the LLC conversion and will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Broadcom as a result of the second merger. As a result of the transactions, VMware will no longer be a publicly
held company and VMware common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered
under the Exchange Act.
Q:
What are the closing conditions that must be satisfied to complete the transactions and can the parties waive
the closing conditions?
A:
There are a number of conditions to the closing of the transactions. For a summary of the conditions that must
be satisfied or waived prior to the consummation of the transactions, see the section titled “The Merger
Agreement-Conditions to the Transactions.” The closing conditions can be waived by the applicable parties to
the extent permitted by applicable law, but no party is required to waive any closing conditions.
4
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If the parties were to waive any closing conditions-such as the condition that: (i) the shares of Broadcom
common stock to be issued to VMware stockholders in the second merger be approved for listing on The
Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance, (ii) the representations and warranties of
VMware and Broadcom must be true and correct as of the closing, subject to certain materiality or material
adverse effect qualifiers, or (iii) no material adverse effect has occurred on the other party that is continuing-
such waiver may have an adverse effect on VMware and Broadcom and their respective stockholders. For a
summary of the potential risks relating to the transactions, see the section titled “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to
the Transactions.”
Q:
When are the transactions expected to be completed?
A:
Broadcom and VMware currently expect the transactions to be completed during Broadcom’s fiscal year 2023,
subject to the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common
stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement, the expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any
extensions thereof) applicable to the transactions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (referred to as the HSR Act), the receipt of the clearances and approvals applicable to the
transactions under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, and the satisfaction
or waiver of the other closing conditions contained in the merger agreement. However, Broadcom and VMware
cannot predict the actual date on which the transactions will be completed because completion is subject to
conditions beyond their control and it is possible that such conditions could result in the transactions being
completed earlier or later or not being completed at all. See the sections titled “The Transactions-Regulatory
Clearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions” and “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the
Transactions.”
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on?
A:
You are being asked to vote upon the following proposals:
1.
Proposal 1-The Merger Agreement Proposal: the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is
further described in the sections titled “The Transactions” and “The Merger Agreement” and a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, and to approve the first merger and the
second merger;
2.
Proposal 2-The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal: the proposal to approve on an advisory (non-
binding) basis the compensation that may be paid or become payable to VMware’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions;
3.
Proposal 3-The Adjournment Proposal: the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if
necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement
proposal; and
4
Proposal 4-The Charter Amendment Proposal: the proposal to approve and adopt the charter
amendment, which is further described in the section titled “Proposal 4: The Charter Amendment Proposal,”
and the full text of which is set forth in the proposed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
VMware (with additions shown as underlined and deletions shown as struck through), which is attached to
this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G.
Q:
How does the VMware board of directors recommend that I vote at the special meeting?
A:
The VMware board of directors unanimously recommends that VMware stockholders vote “FOR” the merger
agreement proposal, “FOR” the charter amendment proposal and “FOR” each of the other proposals described
in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, please
submit your proxy as soon as possible so that your shares of VMware common stock will be represented and
voted at the special meeting. Please follow the instructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting
instruction card provided by the record holder if your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee.
5
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Should I send in my VMware stock certificates now?
A:
No. Please do not send in your VMware stock certificates with your proxy. You should submit your VMware
stock certificates with your election form. If a VMware stockholder who holds VMware common stock in
certificated form does not submit its, his or her stock certificate(s) with the election form, such VMware
stockholder will be sent materials after the transactions close to effect the exchange of such stockholder’s
VMware common stock for the merger consideration. See “The Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment
Procedures.”
Q:
When and where is the special meeting of the VMware stockholders?
A:
The special meeting will be held on November 4, 2022, beginning at 8:30 a.m., Pacific time, unless postponed to a
later date, via live audio webcast at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VMW2022SM. You will need the 16-
digit control number provided on your proxy card or voting instruction card in order to participate in the special
meeting.
Q:
Who can vote at the special meeting?
A:
Only VMware stockholders who held shares of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2022, the
record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. VMware’s
official stock ownership records will conclusively determine whether a stockholder is a “holder of record” as of
the record date.
Q:
How many votes do I have?
A:
You are entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the special meeting for each share of
VMware common stock you hold or beneficially own as of the close of business on the record date. As of the
close of business on the record date, there were 424,475,071 shares of VMware common stock outstanding and
owned by stockholders (i.e., excluding shares of VMware common stock held in treasury by VMware) held by
3,779 holders of record.
Q:
What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?
A:
The presence of holders of shares representing at least a majority of the total outstanding shares of VMware
common stock on the record date entitled to vote at the special meeting, represented virtually or by proxy,
constitute a quorum. Stockholders choosing to abstain from voting and broker “non-votes” will be treated as
present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but will not be counted as votes cast “FOR”
any matter.
Q:
What vote is required to approve each proposal to be considered at the VMware special meeting?
A:
The votes required for each proposal are as follows:
1.
Proposal 1-The Merger Agreement Proposal: The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock entitled to vote on the merger
agreement proposal is required to approve the merger agreement proposal.
2.
Proposal 2-The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal: The affirmative vote of holders of at least a
majority of the shares of VMware common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy,
and entitled to vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is required to approve, on an advisory
(non-binding) basis, the merger-related compensation proposal.
3.
Proposal 3-The Adjournment Proposal: The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the shares
of VMware common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote on
the adjournment proposal is required to approve the adjournment proposal.
4.
Proposal 4-The Charter Amendment Proposal: The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of holders of at
least 67% of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock entitled to vote on the charter amendment
proposal is required to approve the charter amendment proposal.
6
TABLE OF CONTENTS
As of September 30, 2022, the record date, VMware directors and executive officers, as a group, owned and were
entitled to vote 169,663,338 shares of VMware common stock, or approximately 40.0% of the outstanding shares
of VMware common stock. VMware currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote their
shares in favor of the merger agreement proposal and each of the other proposals described in this proxy
statement/prospectus, although none of them are obligated to do so, other than Michael S. Dell with respect to
the merger agreement proposal and the adjournment proposal.
Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of (i) Michael S. Dell (the current chairman and a
member of the VMware board of directors) and Susan Lieberman Dell Separate Property Trust (together with
Michael S. Dell referred to as the MSD stockholders) and (ii) Silver Lake Partners IV, L.P., Silver Lake Technology
Investors IV, L.P., Silver Lake Partners V DE (AIV), L.P., Silver Lake Technology Investors V, L.P., SL SPV-2, L.P.
and Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (the foregoing entities listed in this clause (ii) collectively referred to as the SL
stockholders) entered into letter agreements with Broadcom (referred to as the voting agreements) pursuant to
which each such party agreed, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the voting
agreements, to vote the shares of VMware common stock held by such party in favor of the merger agreement
proposal. See the section titled “The Voting Agreements.”
As of September 30, 2022, the record date, an aggregate of 211,328,833 shares of VMware common stock, or
approximately 49.8% of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock, were subject to the voting
agreements, copies of which are attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annexes B and C.
Q:
How are proxies counted and what results from a failure to vote, abstention or broker non-vote?
A:
Proposal 1-The Merger Agreement Proposal: If you are a VMware stockholder on the record date and take any
action other than voting (or causing your shares to be voted) “FOR” the merger agreement proposal, it will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger agreement proposal. For example, if you fail to instruct your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger
agreement proposal.
Proposal 2-The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal: If you are a VMware stockholder on the record date
and (i) participate in the special meeting virtually but fail to vote or (ii) mark your proxy card or voting
instruction card to abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger-related compensation
proposal. If you do not (i) participate in the special meeting virtually or by proxy, and do not vote or (ii) instruct
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote your shares, it will have no effect on the merger-related
compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
Proposal 3-The Adjournment Proposal: If you are a VMware stockholder on the record date and (i) participate
in the special meeting virtually but fail to vote or (ii) mark your proxy card or voting instruction card to abstain, it
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adjournment proposal. If you do not (i) participate in the
special meeting, virtually or by proxy, and do not vote or (ii) instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee
how to vote your shares, it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
Proposal 4-The Charter Amendment Proposal: If you are a VMware stockholder on the record date and take
any action other than voting (or causing your shares to be voted) “FOR” the charter amendment proposal, it will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the charter amendment proposal. For example, if you fail to instruct
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote ”AGAINST” the
charter amendment proposal.
Q:
What will happen if the merger-related compensation proposal is not approved?
A:
The merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only and not binding on VMware or Broadcom, whether
or not the transactions are completed. The vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is separate and
apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the first merger and the second merger and not a
condition to the completion of the transactions. If the transactions are completed, the merger-related
compensation that is the subject of this proposal may be paid to VMware’s named executive officers in
accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if the VMware
stockholders fail to approve this proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under applicable stock exchange rules, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee cannot vote your shares of
VMware common stock on “non-routine” matters without your instructions. If you do not provide these
instructions, a “non-vote” occurs with respect to those matters. The merger agreement proposal, the merger-
related compensation proposal, the adjournment proposal and the charter amendment proposal will be
considered “non-routine” matters.
Accordingly, if you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee instructions on how to vote your
shares of VMware common stock at the special meeting, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee generally
will not be permitted to vote your shares on any of the proposals at the special meeting. VMware strongly
encourages you to provide voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee so that your vote
will be counted on all matters.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and in “street name”?
A:
If your shares of VMware common stock are registered directly in your name with the transfer agent of VMware,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Co., you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares.
As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote or to grant a proxy for your vote directly to VMware or
to a third party to vote at the special meeting.
If your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of
shares held in “street name,” and, for the purposes of this proxy statement/prospectus, a beneficial owner, and
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares.
If you are a beneficial owner, you have a right to direct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to
vote the shares held in your account. The availability of Internet or telephonic voting will depend on the
nominee’s voting process. Please check with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and follow the voting
procedures your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee provides. You are invited to participate in the special
meeting; however, you may not vote your shares virtually at the special meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy
from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares
at the special meeting.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting, including multiple copies of this
proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your
VMware common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card
for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are
registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please submit each separate proxy
card or voting instruction card that you receive by following the instructions set forth in each separate proxy
card or voting instruction card.
Q:
What do I do if I am a VMware stockholder and I want to revoke my proxy?
A:
Stockholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time prior to the voting at the special meeting in any of
the following ways:
•
signing and delivering a new proxy relating to the same shares and bearing a later date than the original
proxy;
•
sending a signed, written notice of revocation, which is dated later than the date of the proxy and states
that the proxy is revoked, to Attention: Secretary, VMware, Inc. Legal Department, 3401 Hillview Avenue,
Palo Alto, California 94304; or
•
participating in the special meeting and voting virtually. Participation in the virtual special meeting will not,
however, in and of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior proxy.
Beneficial owners of shares held in “street name” may change their voting instructions only by following the
directions received from their bank, brokerage firm or other nominee for changing their voting instructions.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of VMware common stock before the special meeting?
A:
The record date is earlier than both the date of the special meeting and the closing of the transactions. If you
transfer your shares of VMware common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you
9
TABLE OF CONTENTS
will, unless the transferee requests a proxy from you, retain your right to vote at the special meeting but will
transfer the right to receive the merger consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. In order
to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares upon completion of the transactions.
Q:
Do VMware stockholders have appraisal rights?
A:
Yes. VMware stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the
second merger, provided they follow the procedures and satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL. VMware stockholders do not, however, have appraisal rights in connection with the first merger. For more
information regarding appraisal rights, see the section titled “Appraisal Rights of VMware Stockholders.” In
addition, a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex F to this proxy statement/prospectus. Failure
to strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL may result in your waiver of, or inability to, exercise appraisal
rights.
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
VMware will pay for the proxy solicitation costs related to the special meeting. VMware has engaged D.F. King
to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. VMware estimates that it will pay D.F. King a fee of
approximately $17,500, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. VMware will also reimburse banks, brokerage
firms, custodians, trustees, nominees and fiduciaries who hold shares for the benefit of another party for their
expenses incurred in sending proxies and proxy materials to beneficial owners of VMware common stock.
VMware’s directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies in person by telephone or over the Internet.
They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
Q:
How can I find more information about Broadcom and VMware?
A:
You can find more information about Broadcom and VMware from various sources described in the section titled
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Who can answer any questions I may have about the special meeting or the proxy materials?
A:
If you have any questions about the special meeting, the transactions, the proposals or this proxy
statement/prospectus, would like additional copies of the proxy statement/prospectus, need to obtain proxy
cards or other information related to this proxy solicitation or need help submitting a proxy or voting your shares

The Transactions and the Merger Agreement (see pages 47 and 94)
The terms and conditions of the transactions are contained in the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. VMware encourages you to read the merger agreement carefully and in
its entirety, as it is the legal document that governs the transactions.
The merger agreement provides that, through a series of transactions including the first merger and the second

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with Delaware law:
•
Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware (referred to as the first merger), with VMware surviving the
first merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco;
•
following the effective time of the first merger, VMware, the surviving company of the first merger, will be
converted (referred to as the LLC conversion) into a Delaware limited liability company;
•
following the effective time of the LLC conversion, Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into Holdco (referred
to as the second merger), with Holdco surviving the second merger and becoming a wholly owned
subsidiary of Broadcom; and
•
following the effective time of the second merger, Holdco, the surviving company of the second merger, will
merge with and into Merger Sub 3 (referred to as the third merger), with Merger Sub 3 surviving the third
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The first merger, the second merger, the third merger and the LLC conversion are collectively referred to as the
transactions. The parties chose the structure described and depicted above to enable the transactions to qualify for
the Intended Tax Treatment (as defined below), and to preserve VMware as a corporate entity in Broadcom’s
corporate structure following the closing of the transactions.
At the effective time of the first merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time of the first merger will be converted into one share of common stock of Holdco, and each
outstanding VMware equity award will be converted into a Holdco award that relates to a number of shares of
Holdco common stock that is equal to the number of shares of VMware common stock that were subject to such
award prior to such conversion.
For more information, see the section titled “The Merger Agreement-Effects of the Transactions.”
Merger Consideration (see page 50)
At the effective time of the second merger, each issued and outstanding share of VMware common stock (other than
shares (i) owned or held in treasury by VMware or by Merger Sub 2 or in the treasury of VMware as the surviving
company in the first merger (referred to as cancelled shares), (ii) owned by stockholders that did not vote in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the first merger and the second merger and have validly made a
demand for appraisal and not validly withdrawn such demand or otherwise lost their rights of appraisal with respect
to such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (referred to as dissenting shares) and (iii) owned by any wholly
owned subsidiary of VMware (referred to as excluded shares)) will be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder of such share and subject to proration, $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.25200 of a share of
Broadcom common stock. No fractional shares of Broadcom common stock will be issued in the second merger, and
holders of VMware common stock will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom common stock.
The merger consideration is subject to proration so that 50% of VMware common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger will be converted into cash consideration and 50% will be
converted into stock consideration. A holder of VMware common stock may elect to receive (i) solely the cash
consideration, (ii) solely the stock consideration or (iii) if the holder of VMware common stock owns more than one
share, a combination of the cash consideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the
remaining number of shares. The election will be subject to the election of other holders of VMware common stock
and a proration mechanism. For example, if you elect to receive solely the cash consideration or solely the stock
consideration, and all other VMware stockholders make the same election, the consideration you receive will vary to
the maximum extent possible compared to your original election. In such instance, you would receive the cash
consideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware common stock and the stock consideration in exchange
for 50% of your shares of VMware common stock. The following examples illustrate the proration mechanism in the
case of an oversubscription of either the cash consideration or the stock consideration (both if you elect solely the
oversubscribed form of merger consideration and if you elect a combination of the cash consideration and the stock
consideration). Note that for illustrative purposes, the following examples do not round shares to the nearest whole
number.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the cash consideration, and
80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect
to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,
you will receive cash in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common
stock in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 55 shares
and the stock consideration for 45 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive
cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the
outstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 34.375 of your
shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 65.625 of your shares of
VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the stock consideration, and
80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock, 15% of the
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make
an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and
Broadcom common stock in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 45 shares
and the stock consideration for 55 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive
Broadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the
outstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 65.625 of your
shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 34.375 of your shares of
VMware common stock.
A holder of VMware common stock who does not make an election will be treated as having elected to receive cash
consideration or stock consideration in accordance with the proration methodology in the merger agreement, which is
described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement-Effect of the Transactions-Proration and Allocation of Merger
Consideration.”
On May 25, 2022 (the last full trading day before the announcement of the transactions), the closing stock price per
share of Broadcom common stock was $531.63, which, after giving effect to the exchange ratio of 0.25200, has an
implied value of approximately $133.97 per share. Based on this price, with respect to the stock consideration and the
cash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the transactions, VMware stockholders that receive the
cash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock and receive the stock consideration for 50% of
their shares of VMware common stock would receive total merger consideration with an implied value of
approximately $138.24 per share.
On September 30, 2022 (the most recent practicable date prior to the date prior to the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus), the closing stock price per share of Broadcom common stock was $444.01, which, after giving
effect to the exchange ratio of 0.25200, has an implied value of approximately $111.89 per share. Based on this price,
with respect to the stock consideration and the cash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the
transactions, VMware stockholders that receive the cash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common
stock and receive the stock consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock would receive total
merger consideration with an implied value of approximately $127.20 per share.
The implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Broadcom common stock fluctuates
because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Broadcom common stock. As a result, the
value of the stock consideration that VMware stockholders will receive upon completion of the second merger could
be greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, at the time of the VMware special meeting or on the date on which VMware stockholders make
their election. Accordingly, Broadcom and VMware encourage you to obtain current stock price quotations for
Broadcom common stock and VMware common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to the merger
agreement proposal. Broadcom common stock and VMware common stock trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market
and the New York Stock Exchange, respectively, under the symbols “AVGO” and “VMW,” respectively.

The record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting is
September 30, 2022 (referred to as the record date). Only VMware stockholders who held shares of record as of the

“holder of record” as of the record date.
Required Vote
•
Proposal 1-The Merger Agreement Proposal. The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock entitled to vote on the merger
agreement proposal is required to approve the merger agreement proposal.

As of the record date, VMware directors and executive officers, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote
169,663,338 shares of VMware common stock, or approximately 40.0% of the outstanding shares of VMware common
stock. VMware currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of
approving the merger agreement proposal, the charter amendment proposal and each of the other proposals
described in this proxy statement/prospectus, although none of them are obligated to do so, other than Michael S.
Dell with respect to the merger agreement proposal and the adjournment proposal.
Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of (i) the MSD stockholders and (ii) the SL
stockholders have agreed to vote all of the shares of VMware common stock held by them (representing in the
aggregate approximately 49.8% of the total outstanding shares of VMware common stock as of the record date) in
favor of the merger agreement proposal, as described in more detail in the section titled “The Voting Agreements.”
VMware’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the VMware Board of Directors (see page 57)
At its May 26, 2022 meeting held to evaluate the transactions, the VMware board of directors unanimously (i)
determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best interests, of
VMware and the VMware stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the VMware
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii) approved the execution and delivery
by VMware of the merger agreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements contained therein
and the consummation of the transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement and (iv) resolved to recommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.
Additionally, the VMware board of directors has approved, adopted, authorized and declared advisable the charter
amendment.
The VMware board of directors unanimously recommends that VMware stockholders vote “FOR” the merger
agreement proposal, “FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal, “FOR” the adjournment proposal, and
“FOR” the charter amendment proposal.
In evaluating the transactions and the merger agreement and arriving at its determination, the VMware board of
directors consulted with VMware’s senior management, VMware’s financial advisors, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
(referred to as Goldman Sachs) and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (referred to as J.P. Morgan), and VMware’s outside
legal counsel, and considered a number of substantive factors, both positive and negative, and potential benefits and
detriments of the transactions to VMware and its stockholders, as described in more detail in the section titled “The
Transactions-VMware’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the VMware Board of Directors.”

Opinion of Goldman Sachs (see page 65)
Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May 26,
2022, to the VMware board of directors that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the
various limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to
the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated May 26, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion
for the information and assistance of the VMware board of directors in connection with its consideration of the
transactions. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of VMware common stock
should vote with respect to the transactions or any other matter.
Opinion of J.P. Morgan (see page 73)
J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May 26, 2022,

Interests of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions (see page 80)
When considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors with respect to the transactions, you
should be aware that VMware’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the transactions that are
different from, or in addition to, those of VMware stockholders more generally. The VMware board of directors was
aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger
agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions and
in recommending that VMware stockholders vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal. These interests include,
among others, the treatment of outstanding VMware equity awards in connection with the transactions and certain
potential severance payments in connection with the transactions and a qualifying termination of employment upon
or following the transactions, as described in more detail in the section titled “The Transactions-Interests of
VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions.”
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (see page 85)
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the transactions are intended to be treated as follows: (i) the first merger and
the LLC conversion, taken together, are intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a)
(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as the Code) and (ii) the second merger and the
third merger, taken together, are intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code (clauses (i) and (ii) together, collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). VMware’s obligation to
complete the transactions is conditioned upon the delivery by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel to VMware
(referred to as Gibson Dunn) (or other nationally recognized tax counsel or Big 4 accounting firm as may be
reasonably acceptable to VMware), of its opinion that the transactions will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment
(referred to as the Tax Opinion).
Provided the transactions qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the
transactions to a U.S. holder (as defined in the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Consequences”) of VMware common stock will depend primarily on whether such holder exchanges its shares of
VMware common stock solely for shares of Broadcom common stock, solely for cash, or for a combination of shares
of Broadcom common stock and cash:
•
U.S. holders of VMware common stock who exchange their shares of common stock solely for shares of
Broadcom common stock generally will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange, except with respect to
cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Broadcom common stock.
•
U.S. holders of VMware common stock who exchange their shares of common stock solely for cash
generally will recognize gain or loss on the exchange. Such gain or loss generally will be equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
shares of VMware common stock surrendered.
•
U.S. holders of VMware common stock who exchange their shares of common stock for a combination of
shares of Broadcom common stock and cash generally will recognize gain, but not loss, on the exchange. If
the sum of the fair market value of the Broadcom common stock and the amount of cash received by a U.S.
holder in exchange for such holder’s shares of VMware common stock exceeds the tax basis in the shares
of VMware common stock, such holder generally will recognize taxable gain on the exchange equal to the
lesser of the amount of such excess and the amount of cash received in the exchange.
Under certain circumstances, a holder of shares of VMware common stock could be treated as receiving a dividend in
an amount up to the cash consideration received by that holder in the transactions. If the applicable withholding
agent is unable to determine whether such cash consideration should be so treated, a holder of VMware common
stock that is not a U.S. holder may be subject to United States withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as
may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of cash payable to such holder in the
transactions.
Each VMware stockholder should read the discussion under the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences” and should consult his, her or its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax considerations of the
transactions to such holder.
Accounting Treatment of the Transactions (see page 85)
The transactions will be accounted for as a business combination, with Broadcom using the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations, and, accordingly, will
generally result in the recognition of VMware assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. However, as of the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets
acquired (including intangible assets, such as completed technology, customer relationships and customer lists, and
trademarks and trade names) and liabilities assumed have been performed based on publicly available benchmarking
information as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market participant assumptions, as there are
limitations to the type of information that can be exchanged between Broadcom and VMware at this time. Until the
transactions are complete, Broadcom will not have complete access to all the relevant information. Differences
between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and there can be no assurances
that the final valuations will not result in material changes to this preliminary purchase price allocation. The excess of
the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information will be allocated to goodwill. A final determination of these fair values will reflect
appraisals prepared by independent third-parties and will be based on the actual tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities that exist as of the acquisition date. The actual allocation of the consideration transferred may differ from
the allocation assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and may result in
adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions (see pages 89 and 90)
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters. The transactions are subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which
prevents VMware and Broadcom from completing the transactions until required information and materials are
furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (referred to as the DOJ) and the Federal Trade
Commission (referred to as the FTC) and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires. VMware and
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Broadcom submitted the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act on June 10, 2022. On July 11, 2022
VMware and Broadcom each received a request for additional information, often referred to as a “second request,”
from the FTC under the HSR Act.
Foreign Regulatory Clearances. The completion of the transactions is subject to clearance under the antitrust laws
of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, and the parties will file or have filed merger notifications
pursuant to antitrust and competition laws with the appropriate regulators in the European Union and certain other
jurisdictions. The parties must observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearances
or consents pursuant to certain of these foreign laws before completing the transactions.
Other state or foreign antitrust, competition and foreign investment authorities may take action under the laws of
their jurisdictions, which could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the transactions. For more information
about regulatory approvals relating to the transactions, see the sections titled “The Transactions-Regulatory
Clearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions” and “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the
Transactions.”
Although the parties expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, the parties cannot
assure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the
granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the
completion of the transactions, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or
obligations or enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the
transactions not being satisfied.
Expected Timing of the Transactions
Broadcom and VMware currently expect the transactions to be completed during Broadcom’s fiscal year 2023, subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement by the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock, the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the receipt of approvals or clearances required under the
antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. However, Broadcom and VMware cannot predict
the actual date on which the transactions will be completed because completion is subject to conditions beyond their
control and it is possible that such conditions could result in the transactions being completed earlier or later or not
being completed at all. See the sections titled “The Merger Agreement-Efforts to Obtain Regulatory Approvals” and
“The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Transactions.” Also, see the section titled “The Transactions-Regulatory
Clearances and Approvals Required for the Transaction.”
Treatment of VMware Equity Awards (see pages 101 and 102)
Treatment of Stock Options
At the effective time of the second merger, each outstanding and in-the-money VMware stock option will become
vested and will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each net option share
subject to such stock option, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the stock consideration,
less applicable tax withholding. For this purpose, net option shares are calculated as the number of shares of VMware
common stock having a value equal to the in-the-money value of the stock option based on the value of the merger
consideration, with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the volume weighted
average sale price of Broadcom common stock over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the second to last
trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the second merger (referred to as the Broadcom trading price).
Treatment of Restricted Stock Units
At the effective time of the second merger:
•
each outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee director will become vested
and will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each share of VMware
common stock subject to such award, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the
stock consideration;
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
each outstanding time-based VMware restricted stock unit award that is not held by a non-employee
director will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange
ratio calculated as the sum of (i) 50% of the stock consideration and (ii) 50% of the cash consideration
divided by the Broadcom trading price; and
•
each outstanding performance-based VMware restricted stock unit award will be converted into a
Broadcom restricted stock unit award using the same formula described in the above bullet, provided that
(i) for each such award granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit plan, performance
goals will be deemed achieved (1) at the actual level with respect to performance periods completed prior to
the closing of the transactions, or (2) at target level with respect to performance periods not completed
prior to the closing of the transactions and (ii) for each such award that was granted under the VMware
total shareholder return (TSR) performance stock unit plan, performance will be measured at the closing of
the transactions based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals based on the
value of merger consideration (with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based
on the Broadcom trading price).
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, VMware, the VMware board of directors or the compensation
committee of the VMware board of directors, as applicable, will take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of
VMware’s employee stock purchase plan, as amended (referred to as the ESPP), to terminate the ESPP effective as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger, contingent upon the occurrence of the second merger,
and to provide that, (i) no offering or purchase period will be continued or commenced under the ESPP, except for any
offering or purchase period under VMware’s ESPP that was in effect on the date of the merger agreement (referred to
as the current ESPP offering period); (ii) no new participants may elect to participate in the ESPP during the current
ESPP offering period; and (iii) no participant may increase the participant’s payroll deductions with respect to the
current ESPP offering period. The final exercise date under the current ESPP offering period shall be the earlier of (A)
the normal exercise date for the current ESPP offering period and (B) five business days prior to the effective time of
the second merger (such earlier date is referred to as the final exercise date). Each ESPP participant’s accumulated
contributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase shares of VMware common stock in accordance with the terms
of the ESPP as of the final exercise date, which shares will be treated in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement, and as promptly as practicable following the purchase of such shares in accordance with this sentence,
VMware will return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account after such
purchase.
Listing of Broadcom Common Stock; Delisting of VMware Common Stock (see page 93)
It is a condition to the consummation of the transactions that the shares of Broadcom common stock to be issued to
VMware stockholders in the second merger be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to
official notice of issuance. As a result of the second merger, shares of VMware common stock will cease to be listed
on the New York Stock Exchange.
Appraisal Rights of VMware Stockholders (see page 160)
VMware stockholders who do not vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement proposal, who continuously
hold their shares of Holdco common stock received in connection with the first merger through the effective time of
the second merger and who otherwise comply precisely with the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
will be entitled to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of VMware common stock, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, if the second merger is completed. The “fair value” of your shares of VMware common
stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of
the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement.
VMware stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares must so advise VMware by
submitting a written demand for appraisal in the form described in this proxy statement/prospectus prior to the vote
to approve the merger agreement proposal, and must otherwise follow the procedures prescribed by Section 262 of
the DGCL. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of VMware common stock held of record in the name of
another person, such as a nominee or intermediary, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps
summarized in this proxy statement/prospectus and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights.
21
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex F to this proxy statement/prospectus. You are encouraged
to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising
appraisal rights, VMware stockholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice
of legal counsel and their financial advisors. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions may result in the loss of
appraisal rights.
Go Shop; No Solicitation of Other Offers by VMware (see page 110)
The merger agreement provides that from the date thereof until 11:59 p.m. Pacific time, on July 5, 2022 (referred to as
the no-shop period start date), VMware and its subsidiaries and their respective representatives may solicit,
encourage or facilitate any acquisition proposal and any proposal, inquiry or offer that could be reasonably expected
to lead to, result in or constitute an acquisition proposal, including providing information regarding VMware to any
person pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, and engaging in discussions or negotiations with
respect to such acquisition proposal.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the no-shop period start date and except as permitted under
the prior paragraph, VMware has agreed not to solicit, encourage or facilitate any competing acquisition proposals
for VMware, enter into discussions or negotiations with any third parties regarding any competing acquisition
proposals for VMware or enter into any agreements with a third party regarding any competing acquisition proposals
for VMware.
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, from and following the no-shop period start date, if VMware receives an
unsolicited competing acquisition proposal, prior to VMware stockholders adopting the merger agreement at the
special meeting, that the VMware board determines to be superior to the transactions or reasonably be expected to
lead to a proposal that is superior to the transactions, subject to certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement,
VMware is permitted to engage in discussions and negotiations with the party that sent the competing acquisition
proposal (and its representatives, advisors and financing sources) and furnish non-public information to that party
(and its representatives, advisors and debt financing sources).
Under the terms of the merger agreement and subject to certain conditions set forth therein (including the payment of
a $1.5 billion termination fee or $750 million termination fee, as applicable), prior to VMware stockholders adopting the
merger agreement at the special meeting, VMware may terminate the merger agreement to accept a competing
acquisition proposal that the VMware board of directors has determined to be superior to the transactions from a
financial point of view. See “The Merger Agreement-Go Shop; No Solicitation of Other Offers by VMware” and “The
Merger Agreement-Change of Recommendation; Match Rights.”
Litigation Relating to the Transactions (see page 92)
In connection with the transactions, five complaints have been filed as individual actions in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York and one complaint has been filed as an individual action in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaints are captioned as follows: (1) Stein v.
VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06307 (filed July 25, 2022); (2) O’Dell v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06352 (filed July 26,
2022); (3) Whitfield v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06527 (filed August 1, 2022); (4) Waterman v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-
cv-06533 (filed August 2, 2022); (5) Laufer v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-5146 (filed September 9, 2022); and (6)
Chapman v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-7735 (filed September 11, 2022) (collectively referred to as the Complaints).
The Complaints generally allege that this proxy statement/prospectus misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly
material information. The Complaints assert violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder against VMware and the members of the VMware board of directors. The Complaints seek,
among other things, an injunction enjoining the consummation of the transactions, direction that a registration
statement is disseminated, including certain additional information, rescission or rescissory damages in the event the
transactions are consummated; declaration that defendants violated Section 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act,
as well as SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder; direction that defendants account for all damages suffered as a
result of any misconduct; costs of the action, including plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees; and other relief
the court may deem just and proper. In
22
TABLE OF CONTENTS
addition to the Complaints, beginning on July 20, 2022, certain purported stockholders of VMware sent demand
letters (referred to as the Demands, and together with the Complaints, the Matters) alleging similar deficiencies
regarding the disclosures made in this proxy statement/prospectus, and seek additional disclosures to address those
purported deficiencies.
VMware cannot predict the outcomes of the Matters. VMware management believes that the Matters are without
merit and intends to vigorously defend against the Matters and any subsequent similar demands or filed actions. If
additional similar complaints are filed or demands sent, absent new or significantly different allegations, VMware will
not necessarily disclose such additional filings or demands.
Conditions to the Transactions (see page 117)
The respective obligations of VMware, Holdco, Merger Sub 1, Broadcom and Broadcom Merger Subs to consummate
the transactions are subject to the satisfaction (or waiver if permitted under the merger agreement) of customary
conditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement by VMware’s stockholders by the affirmative vote of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock, the expiration or termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act and the receipt of approvals or clearances required under the antitrust laws of the
European Union and certain other jurisdictions.
The obligations of Broadcom and Broadcom Merger Subs to consummate the transactions are also subject to the
absence of a VMware material adverse effect (as defined in the section titled “The Merger Agreement-
Representations and Warranties”) after the date of the merger agreement that is continuing, the accuracy of VMware,
Holdco and Merger Sub 1 representations and warranties and compliance by VMware, Holdco and Merger Sub 1 with
its obligations and agreements under the merger agreement, as described in the section titled “The Merger
Agreement-Representations and Warranties.”
The merger agreement does not include a financing condition.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the parties are required to close the transactions on the third business day
following the date on which the closing conditions to the transactions are satisfied. However, if the closing date
would occur within 35 days of the end of Broadcom’s fiscal year or any other fiscal quarter, Broadcom may, upon
written notice to VMware, choose to defer the closing of the transactions to the first business day of its next fiscal
year or fiscal quarter, respectively (or to another date agreed to between VMware and Broadcom). See the section
titled “The Merger Agreement-Closing; Effective Time.”
Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 120)
Among other customary circumstances, Broadcom or VMware may terminate the merger agreement if:
•
any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction,
decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions;
•
the effective time of the second merger has not occurred on or before February 26, 2023 (which we refer to
as the outside date); however, (i) if, on the outside date, all of the conditions to the transactions (other than
those conditions relating to antitrust approvals or no injunction (to the extent the relevant injunction or
order is in respect of, or any such law is, the HSR Act or any other antitrust law) or those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied or waived on the closing date (if such conditions would be satisfied or
validly waived were the closing of the transactions to occur at such time)) shall have been satisfied or
waived, then the outside date may be extended, by either VMware or Broadcom by providing written notice
five business days prior to the outside date, for a period of three months, (ii) if, on the outside date, as
extended, all of the conditions to the transactions (other than those conditions relating to antitrust
approvals or no injunction (to the extent the relevant injunction or order is in respect of, or any such law is,
the HSR Act or any other antitrust law) or those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived on the closing date of the transactions (if such conditions would be satisfied or validly waived were
the closing of the transactions to occur at such time)) shall have been satisfied or waived, then the outside
date may be further extended, by either VMware or Broadcom by providing written notice five business
days prior to the as extended outside date, for a period of three months, (iii) if, on the outside date, as
extended, all of the conditions to the transactions (other than those conditions relating to antitrust
approvals or no injunction (to the extent the relevant
23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
injunction or order is in respect of, or any such law is, the HSR Act or any other antitrust law) or those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived on the closing date of the transactions (if such
conditions would be satisfied or validly waived were the closing of the transactions to occur at such time))
shall have been satisfied or waived, then the outside date may be further extended, by either VMware or
Broadcom by providing written notice five business days prior to the as extended outside date, for a period
of three months and (iv) this right to terminate will not be available to any party whose action or failure to
fulfill any obligation was a proximate cause of the failure of the effective time of the second merger to occur
prior to the outside date and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of the merger
agreement; and
•
the special meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) has concluded and the
VMware stockholders have not adopted the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of at least a majority
of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock.
Termination Fee and Expenses (see page 122)
VMware must pay Broadcom a termination fee of $1.5 billion if the merger agreement is terminated in certain
circumstances including VMware entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, an adverse
recommendation change or a willful breach in a material respect of VMware’s non-solicitation obligations under the
merger agreement, unless VMware terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to a superior proposal prior to the no-shop period start date, in which case VMware will be required to pay
Broadcom a lower termination fee in the amount of $750 million.
Broadcom must pay VMware a termination fee of $1.5 billion if the merger agreement is terminated in certain
circumstances including as a result of certain required regulatory clearances not being obtained by the outside date.
All other expenses relating to the transactions will generally be paid by the party incurring the expense.
Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of Broadcom and VMware (see page 143)
Upon the completion of the transactions, VMware stockholders receiving shares of Broadcom common stock will
become stockholders of Broadcom, and their rights will be governed by the governing corporate documents of
Broadcom in effect at the effective time of the second merger, which are different from VMware’s governing corporate
documents, as further described in the section titled “-Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of Broadcom
and VMware.”
Charter Amendment (see page 46)
VMware is asking its stockholders to approve the charter amendment, which eliminates the personal liability of
VMware’s officers for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as an officer, except to the extent such an
exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL.
The VMware board of directors has approved, adopted, authorized and declared advisable the charter amendment.
The VMware board of directors unanimously recommends that VMware stockholders vote “FOR” the charter
amendment proposal.
Risk Factors (see page 27)

In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus,
including, among other things, the matters addressed in the section titled “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements,” VMware stockholders should carefully consider the following risks before deciding
whether to vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal and the other proposals described in this proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition, VMware stockholders should read and consider the risks associated with each
of the businesses of Broadcom and VMware because these risks will relate to Broadcom following the completion of
the transactions. Descriptions of some of these risks can be found in Broadcom’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and VMware’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 28, 2022 and, in each case, any amendments thereto, as such risk factors may be updated or supplemented
in each company’s subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. You should also consider the other information in
this proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. See the section titled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Risks Relating to the Transactions
Because the stock election exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted for stock price changes and the
market price of Broadcom common stock has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, VMware stockholders
cannot be sure of the value of the consideration they will receive.
Upon completion of the second merger, each issued and outstanding share of VMware common stock (other than (i)
cancelled shares, (ii) dissenting shares and (iii) excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the stockholder and subject to proration, $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.25200 of a share of
Broadcom common stock. Each VMware stockholder may elect to receive (i) solely the cash consideration, (ii) solely
the stock consideration or (iii) if the VMware stockholder owns more than one share, a combination of the cash
consideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the remaining number of shares.
The market price of Broadcom common stock at the time of completion of the transactions may vary significantly from
the market price of Broadcom common stock on the date the merger agreement was executed, the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, the date of the VMware special meeting and the date on which VMware stockholders make
their election. Because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Broadcom common stock, the
value of the stock consideration that VMware stockholders receive upon completion of the transactions may be
higher or lower than the value of the stock consideration on such earlier dates. In addition, as discussed below, the
merger consideration will be subject to proration. Accordingly, VMware stockholders will not know or be able to
calculate at the time of the VMware special meeting the market value of the stock consideration they will receive upon
completion of the transactions.
If a VMware stockholder makes a stock election and the market value of Broadcom common stock falls between the
time of the election and the time the merger consideration is actually received, the value of the merger consideration
received may be less than the value of the merger consideration such stockholder would have received under a cash
election. Conversely, if a VMware stockholder makes a cash election and the market value of Broadcom common
stock rises between the time of the election and the time the merger consideration is actually received, the value of
the merger consideration received may be less than the value of the merger consideration such stockholder would
have received under a stock election. Additionally, the consideration received by VMware stockholders may be
subject to proration, such that a VMware stockholder that makes a cash election may receive stock consideration for
some of their shares of VMware common stock, the value of which will be subject to the uncertainty described above.
Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic
conditions, changes in Broadcom’s and VMware’s respective businesses, operations and prospects, market
assessments of the likelihood that the transactions will be completed, the timing of the transactions, regulatory
considerations and other risk factors set forth or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. Many
of these factors are beyond Broadcom’s and VMware’s control. VMware stockholders are urged to obtain current
market quotations for Broadcom common stock and VMware common stock when they make their elections.
27TABLE OF CONTENTS
VMware stockholders may not receive all consideration in the form they elect, and the form of consideration that
they receive may have a lower value or different tax consequences than the form of consideration that they elect
to receive.
VMware stockholders’ consideration will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware
common stock entitled to receive the cash consideration and the total number of shares of VMware common stock
entitled to receive the stock consideration, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of
VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger.
Accordingly, some of the merger consideration a VMware stockholder receives may differ from the type of
consideration selected and such difference may be significant. This may result in, among other things, tax
consequences that differ from those that would have resulted if the VMware stockholder had received solely the form
of consideration elected. A discussion of the proration mechanism can be found under the section titled “The
Transactions-Merger Consideration” and a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
transactions can be found under the section titled “The Transactions-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences.”
Completion of the transactions is subject to the conditions contained in the merger agreement and if these
conditions are not satisfied or waived, the transactions will not be completed.
The obligations of Broadcom and VMware to complete the transactions are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a
number of conditions, including, among others, the adoption of the merger agreement by VMware’s stockholders by
the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock, the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the receipt of approvals or clearances required under the
antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. For a more complete summary of the required
regulatory approvals and the closing conditions, see the sections titled “The Transactions-Regulatory Clearances
and Approvals for the Transactions” and “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Transactions.”
Although Broadcom and VMware have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to
complete the transactions as promptly as practicable, many of the closing conditions are not within Broadcom’s or
VMware’s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these
conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to February 26, 2023, which deadline may be extended to November 26,
2023 under certain circumstances, it is possible that the merger agreement will be terminated. The failure to satisfy all
of the required conditions could delay the completion of the transactions for a significant period of time or prevent it
from occurring. Any delay in completing the transactions could cause Broadcom not to realize some or all of the
benefits that it expects to achieve if the transactions are successfully completed within their expected timeframe.
There can be no assurance that the closing conditions will be satisfied or waived or that the transactions will be
completed. See the risk factor titled “-Failure to complete the transactions could negatively affect the stock price and
the future business and financial results of VMware,” below.
In the event that the parties determine to waive any of the conditions to the closing of the transactions, such
decision may have an adverse effect on Broadcom and VMware and their respective stockholders. For example, if
Broadcom and VMware waive the condition that the shares of Broadcom common stock to be issued to VMware
stockholders in the second merger must be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and close the
transactions, the shares of Broadcom common stock issued to VMware stockholders at the closing would not be
listed on a stock exchange until The Nasdaq Global Select Market has approved the listing application, and the ability
of VMware stockholders to trade such shares would be adversely affected. By way of further example, if VMware
waives the condition that there be no material adverse effect on Broadcom that has occurred and is continuing, the
value of the consideration received by VMware stockholders could be materially diminished.
In addition, upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, including the termination by
either party because certain required regulatory clearances either are not obtained before the outside date or are
denied, Broadcom would be required to pay VMware a reverse termination fee of $1.5 billion. For additional
information, see the section titled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee and Expenses.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The transactions are subject to the expiration of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals,
consents or clearances from regulatory authorities in the United States, the European Union and certain other
jurisdictions that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Broadcom, VMware or following
the completion of the transactions, Broadcom or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the transactions.
Before the transactions may be completed, any waiting period (or extension thereof) applicable to the transactions
must have expired or been terminated, and any approvals, consents or clearances required in connection with the
transactions must have been obtained, in each case, under the HSR Act and under the antitrust laws of the European
Union and certain other jurisdictions. In addition, the transactions may be reviewed under antitrust statutes or
foreign direct investment regimes of other governmental authorities, including U.S. state laws. In deciding whether to
grant the required regulatory approval, consent or clearance, the relevant governmental entities will consider the
effect of the transactions on competition within their relevant jurisdiction.
effect of the transactions on competition within their relevant jurisdiction.
The terms and conditions of the approvals, consents and clearances that are granted may impose requirements,
limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of Broadcom’s business following the completion of the
transactions. Under the merger agreement, Broadcom and VMware have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain such approvals, consents and clearances and therefore may be required to comply with conditions, terms,
obligations or restrictions imposed by governmental authorities. There can be no assurance that such conditions,
terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the transactions or imposing
additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of Broadcom following the completion of the
transactions. In addition, neither Broadcom nor VMware can provide assurance that any such conditions, terms,
obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the transactions. See the sections titled “The
Transactions-Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions” and “The Merger Agreement-
Conditions to the Transactions.”
The transactions could cause VMware’s spin-off from Dell Technologies, Inc. to become a taxable transaction,
which would result in material indemnification obligations on the part of VMware (which, following the
consummation of the transactions, will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Broadcom).
Under current U.S. federal income tax law, an acquisition of a corporation that was a distributing or controlled
corporation in a spin-off intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code can render the
spin-off taxable to the distributing corporation and, if applicable, its shareholders if such acquisition is deemed to
occur pursuant to a “plan” that includes the spin-off or violates the “device” prohibition. The tax matters agreement
(referred to as the tax matters agreement) entered into by Dell Technologies, Inc. (referred to as Dell), VMware and
certain other parties in connection with VMware’s spin-off from Dell in 2021 (referred to as the VMware spin-off),
governs VMware’s and Dell’s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities
(including taxes, if any, resulting from a failure of the VMware spin-off to qualify as a tax-free transaction under
Section 355 of the Code) and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and
other tax proceedings, cooperation with respect to the tax matters and other matters regarding taxes.
The tax matters agreement generally provides that VMware is responsible for any taxes imposed on Dell or any of its
affiliates (or any of its shareholders that are required to be paid or reimbursed by Dell or any of its affiliates) resulting
from a failure of the VMware spin-off to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code if such failure
is attributable to acquisitions of VMware stock or assets, issuances of stock by VMware, changes in ownership of
VMware stock and certain other specified actions or omissions by VMware, in each case, following the VMware spin-
off. In addition, the tax matters agreement prohibits VMware from taking certain actions (including sales of
substantially all of the assets of VMware, mergers involving VMware and certain acquisitions of VMware stock)
during the two-year period following the VMware spin-off, unless VMware provides Dell with an opinion of counsel
or Internal Revenue Service (referred to as the IRS) private letter ruling confirming that such action will not cause the
VMware spin-off to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code.
In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, VMware provided Dell with an opinion from Gibson Dunn,
counsel to VMware, to the effect that the transactions will not result in the VMware spin-off failing to qualify as a tax-
free transaction under Section 355 of the Code. Moreover, the merger agreement includes a representation by
VMware to Broadcom that such opinion has not been revoked, substantively modified or withdrawn (unless an
acceptable replacement opinion has been received), and Broadcom’s obligation to consummate the transactions is
conditioned on such representation being true and correct in all respects as of
29
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing of the transactions, as though made on and as of the closing
of the transactions. Broadcom may, in its sole discretion, waive the condition relating to the accuracy of this
representation. If (i) there were a breach of VMware’s representation regarding the opinion, (ii) Broadcom were to
waive the condition relating to the accuracy thereof, and (iii) VMware did not obtain an IRS private letter ruling
confirming that the transactions will not cause the VMware spin-off to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction under
Section 355 of the Code, Dell could seek to enjoin the consummation of the transactions. The opinion of Gibson
Dunn is based on, among other things, various assumptions and the accuracy of representations made by VMware,
Broadcom, Dell and certain other persons in connection with the VMware spin-off and the execution of the merger
agreement. If any of these assumptions or representations were, or were to become, inaccurate or incomplete, the
opinion may be invalid. No ruling from the IRS is being sought regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the transactions, and an opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the IRS will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions in the opinion of counsel or that a
court will not sustain such a challenge.
Regardless of whether the condition in the merger agreement relating to the accuracy of VMware’s representation
regarding the opinion required by the tax matters agreement is satisfied or waived by Broadcom, if the VMware spin-
off were determined to be taxable as a result of the transactions, Dell, its affiliates and, potentially, its stockholders
would incur significant tax liabilities and, under the tax matters agreement, VMware (which, following the
consummation of the transactions, will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Broadcom) may be required to indemnify
Dell and its affiliates for any such tax liabilities, which would be material.
VMware’s directors and executive officers have interests in the transactions and the charter amendment that may
be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder of VMware more generally.
When considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors that VMware stockholders approve the
merger agreement proposal, the merger-related compensation proposal and the charter amendment proposal, VMware
stockholders should be aware that directors and executive officers of VMware have certain interests in the
transactions and the charter amendment proposal that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
VMware stockholders more generally. With respect to the merger agreement proposal and the merger-related
compensation proposal, these interests generally include, among others, treatment of outstanding VMware equity
awards in connection with the transactions and certain potential severance payments in connection with the
transactions and a qualifying termination of employment upon or following the transactions. See the section titled
“The Transactions- Interests of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” for a more detailed
description of these interests. With respect to the charter amendment proposal, these interests include the
protections afforded by the charter amendment with respect to the elimination of personal liability of VMware’s
officers for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as an officer, except to the extent such an exemption from
liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL. The VMware board of directors was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the charter amendment and in evaluating and
negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the consummation of
the transactions, and in recommending that VMware stockholders vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal.
The merger agreement limits VMware’s ability to pursue alternatives to the transactions and may discourage
other companies from trying to acquire VMware.
The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for VMware to sell its business to a party other
than Broadcom. These provisions include a general prohibition on VMware soliciting any company takeover
proposal or offer for a competing transaction following the expiration of the go-shop period, which expired on July 5,
2022. In addition, upon termination of the merger agreement, VMware is required to pay Broadcom a termination fee
of $1.5 billion if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances including VMware entering into a
definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, an adverse recommendation change or a willful breach in a
material respect of VMware’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement.
Although the go-shop provision was intended to provide VMware the ability to conduct a reasonable market check
on the adequacy of the merger consideration payable to VMware stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement, it is
possible that the go-shop provision, the no-shop provision or the other provisions of the merger agreement could
discourage a potential acquiror that might have had an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of VMware from
considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
per share cash or market value than the consideration Broadcom proposes to pay in the transactions or might result
in a potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire VMware than it might otherwise
have proposed to pay because of the termination fee that may become payable to Broadcom in certain circumstances
described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee and Expenses.”
The merger agreement subjects VMware to restrictions on its business activities.
The merger agreement subjects VMware to restrictions on its business activities and obligates VMware to generally
conduct its business in a commercially reasonable manner and in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on VMware’s results of
operations, cash flows and financial position.
The business relationships of Broadcom and VMware and their respective subsidiaries may be subject to
disruption due to uncertainty associated with the transactions, which could have an adverse effect on the results
of operations, cash flows and financial position of Broadcom, VMware and, following the completion of the
transactions, Broadcom.
Parties with which Broadcom and VMware, or their respective subsidiaries, do business may be uncertain as to the
effects the transactions may have on them, including with respect to current or future business relationships with
Broadcom, VMware or their respective subsidiaries. These relationships may be subject to disruption as customers,
suppliers and other persons with whom Broadcom and VMware have a business relationship may delay or defer
certain business decisions or might decide to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with Broadcom or
VMware, as applicable, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Broadcom, VMware
or their respective subsidiaries. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash
flows and financial position of Broadcom or VMware, including an adverse effect on Broadcom’s ability to realize the
expected synergies and other benefits of the transactions. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be
exacerbated by a delay in completion of the transactions or termination of the merger agreement.
Failure to complete the transactions could negatively affect the stock price and the future business and financial
results of VMware.
If the transactions are not completed for any reason, including as a result of VMware stockholders failing to approve
the merger agreement proposal, the ongoing business of VMware may be adversely affected and, without realizing
any of the benefits of having completed the transactions, VMware could be subject to a number of negative
consequences, including the following:
•
VMware may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its
stock price;
•
VMware may experience negative reactions from its customers and suppliers;
•
VMware may experience negative reactions from its employees and may not be able to retain key
management personnel and other key employees;
•
VMware will have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant non-recurring costs in connection with
the transactions that it may be unable to recover;
•
the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of VMware’s business prior to completion
of the transactions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Broadcom (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), which may prevent VMware from making certain acquisitions, taking
certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the
transactions that may be beneficial to VMware (see the section titled “The Merger Agreement-Conduct of
Businesses of VMware and Broadcom Prior to Completion of the Transactions” for a description of the
restrictive covenants applicable to VMware); and
•
matters relating to the transactions (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of
time and resources by VMware management, which could otherwise be devoted to day-to-day operations
and other opportunities that may be beneficial to VMware as an independent company.
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, upon termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, VMware is required to pay
Broadcom a termination fee of $1.5 billion, including VMware entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a
superior proposal, an adverse recommendation change or a willful breach in a material respect of VMware’s non-
solicitation obligations under the merger agreement. Finally, VMware could be subject to litigation related to any
failure to complete the transactions or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against VMware to perform
its obligations under the merger agreement. If the transactions are not completed, any of these risks may materialize
and may adversely affect VMware’s businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.
Broadcom expects to obtain financing in connection with the transactions and cannot guarantee that it will be
able to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all.
Broadcom anticipates that the funds needed to complete the transactions will be derived from a combination of (i)
available cash on hand and (ii) third-party debt financing. See “The Transactions-Financing of the Transactions” for
additional information regarding the anticipated financing of the transactions. Broadcom’s ability to obtain any such
new debt financing will depend on, among other factors, prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond
Broadcom’s control. Broadcom cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain new debt financing on terms
acceptable to it or at all, and any such failure could materially adversely affect its operations and financial condition.
Broadcom’s obligation to complete the transactions is not conditioned upon the receipt of any financing.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus
is preliminary and the actual financial condition and results of operations after the transactions may differ
materially from them.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus is
presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what Broadcom’s actual financial
condition or results of operations would have been had the transactions been completed on the dates indicated. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects adjustments, which are based upon
assumptions, preliminary estimates and accounting reclassifications, to record the VMware identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation
reflected in this proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based
upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of VMware as of the date of the
completion of the transactions. Accordingly, the final accounting adjustments as a result of the acquisition may differ
materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see the
section titled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”
Completion of the transactions may trigger change in control provisions in certain agreements to which VMware
is a party.
The completion of the transactions may trigger change in control provisions in certain agreements to which VMware
is a party. If VMware and Broadcom are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may
exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary
damages. Even if VMware and Broadcom are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such
waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to VMware or Broadcom.
Lawsuits have been filed against VMware and its directors, and additional lawsuits may be filed in the future
against VMware, its directors, Broadcom, Holdco, Merger Sub 1 and/or Broadcom Merger Subs challenging the
transactions or any one of them, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent completing the
transactions or completing the transactions within the expected timeframe and/or result in substantial costs to
Broadcom and VMware.
In connection with the transactions, litigation has been filed against VMware and its board of directors. Among other
remedies, the plaintiffs in these lawsuits seek damages or to enjoin the transactions. The outcome of any litigation is
uncertain and any such lawsuits could prevent or delay the completion of the transactions and result in substantial
costs to Broadcom and VMware. Any such actions may create uncertainty relating to the
32
TABLE OF CONTENTS
transactions and may be costly and distracting to management. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or
claim that remains unresolved at the time the transactions are completed may adversely affect Broadcom’s business,
financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see “The Transactions-Litigation Relating to the
Transactions.”
It is possible that additional litigation against VMware, its directors, Broadcom, Holdco, Merger Sub 1 and/or
Broadcom Merger Subs may be filed in the future as securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often
brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger or other business combination
agreements like the merger agreement. Even if such a lawsuit is without merit, defending against these claims can
result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary
damages, which could have a negative impact on Broadcom’s and VMware’s respective liquidity and financial
condition.
Further, one of the conditions to the completion of the transactions is that no injunction or law by any governmental
entity of competent jurisdiction will be in effect that has the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions. As such, if an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the transactions is
obtained, that injunction may prevent the transactions from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the
expected timeframe.
Risks Relating to Broadcom Following Completion of the Transactions
Failure to realize the benefits expected from the transactions could adversely affect the value of Broadcom
common stock.
Although Broadcom expects significant benefits to result from the transactions, there can be no assurance that
Broadcom will actually realize any of them, or realize them within the anticipated timeframe. Achieving these benefits
will depend, in part, on Broadcom’s ability to integrate VMware’s business successfully and efficiently. The
challenges involved with the transactions, which will be complex and time consuming, include the following:
•
preserving customer and other important relationships of VMware and attracting new business and
operational relationships;
•
integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
•
consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative
infrastructures;
•
coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position Broadcom’s capabilities;
•
coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which Broadcom has not previously operated; and
•
integrating employees and related HR systems and benefits, maintaining employee morale and retaining key
employees.
If these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business are not successfully managed,
then Broadcom may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions on Broadcom’s anticipated timeframe or
at all, and Broadcom’s revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially
adversely affected. The successful completion of the transactions will require significant management attention both
before and after the transactions, and may divert the attention of management from Broadcom’s business and
operational issues.
After the transactions, VMware stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in
Broadcom than they currently have in VMware and will exercise less influence over management.
Based on the number of shares of VMware common stock outstanding as of September 12, 2022, and the number of
shares of Broadcom common stock outstanding as of September 12, 2022, it is expected that, immediately after
completion of the transactions, former VMware stockholders will own approximately 12.6% of the outstanding shares
of Broadcom common stock. Consequently, former VMware stockholders will have less influence over the
management and policies of Broadcom than they currently have over the management and policies of VMware.
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The shares of Broadcom common stock have rights different from the shares of VMware common stock.
As a result of the transactions, VMware stockholders will no longer be stockholders of VMware. Former VMware
stockholders who receive stock consideration in the second merger will become Broadcom stockholders, and their
rights as stockholders will be governed by the terms of Broadcom’s governing corporate documents. See the section
titled “Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of Broadcom and VMware” for a discussion of the different
rights associated with Broadcom common stock.
Broadcom and VMware will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the transactions.
Broadcom and VMware will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the
transactions. Following completion of the transactions, Broadcom expects to incur additional expenses in connection
with the integration of VMware’s business. Broadcom may incur additional costs or suffer loss of business under
third-party contracts that are terminated or that contain change in control or other provisions that may be triggered
by the completion of the transactions, and/or losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers, and may also incur
costs to maintain employee morale and to retain certain key management personnel and employees. Broadcom and
VMware will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans, and the execution of these
plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs and time delays. These incremental transaction-related costs may
exceed the cost synergies Broadcom expects to achieve, particularly in the near term. Factors beyond Broadcom’s
control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses, many of which, by their nature, are difficult to
estimate accurately. See “Failure to realize the benefits expected from the transactions could adversely affect the
value of Broadcom’s common stock” for additional integration risks.
Uncertainties associated with the transactions may cause a loss of management personnel and other key
employees of Broadcom or VMware, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of
Broadcom following the transactions.
Broadcom and VMware are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key
employees to execute their business plans. Broadcom’s success after the transactions will depend in part upon its
ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of Broadcom and VMware. Current and
prospective employees of Broadcom and VMware may be uncertain about their future roles with Broadcom following
the transactions, which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of Broadcom and VMware to attract and
retain key personnel during the pendency of the transactions. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Broadcom
will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of Broadcom and VMware.
The market price of Broadcom common stock after the transactions are completed may be affected by factors
different from those affecting shares of VMware common stock before the transactions are completed.
Upon completion of the transactions, certain holders of VMware common stock will become holders of Broadcom
common stock. Broadcom’s business differs in important respects from that of VMware, and accordingly, the market
price of Broadcom common stock after the completion of the transactions may be affected by factors different from
those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Broadcom and VMware. As a result, the
market price of Broadcom common stock may fluctuate significantly following completion of the transactions and
holders of VMware common stock could lose the value of their investment in Broadcom common stock. For a
discussion of the businesses of Broadcom and VMware and of some important factors to consider in connection with
those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus and referred to
under “Where You Can Find More Information.” In addition, if former VMware stockholders sell substantial amounts
of Broadcom common stock in the public market following consummation of the transactions, this could decrease the
market price of Broadcom common stock.
In connection with the transactions, Broadcom will incur new indebtedness. Broadcom’s substantial indebtedness
could adversely affect Broadcom’s financial health and its ability to execute its business strategy.
Broadcom’s aggregate indebtedness as of September 12, 2022 was approximately $41.2 billion (excluding finance
leases). Broadcom’s pro forma indebtedness as of September 12, 2022, after giving effect to the transactions and the
anticipated incurrence of indebtedness in connection therewith, will be as much as $82.5 billion (excluding finance
leases).
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Broadcom’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:
•
increasing its vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;
•
exposing it to interest rate risk due to its variable rate term facilities, which Broadcom does not typically
hedge against;
•
limiting its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor
industry;
•
placing Broadcom at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors with less indebtedness;
•
making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working
capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and
•
potentially requiring Broadcom to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to
payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund its other business
needs.
Broadcom receives debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact its credit
ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth
opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be
considered by the rating agencies. While Broadcom is focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these
agencies, it may be unable to do so. Any downgrade in Broadcom’s credit rating or the ratings of its indebtedness, or
adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could:
•
adversely affect the trading price of, or market for, its debt securities;
•
increase interest expense under its term facilities;
•
increase the cost of, and adversely affect its ability to refinance, its existing debt; and
•
adversely affect its ability to raise additional debt.
Certain of the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the transactions may bear interest at variable interest
rates. If interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely
affect Broadcom’s cash flows.
Other Risks of Broadcom and VMware
Broadcom’s and VMware’s businesses are and will be subject to the risks described above. In addition, Broadcom
and VMware are, and will continue to be, subject to the risks described in Broadcom’s Annual Report for the fiscal
year ended October 31, 2021 and VMware’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022,
as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed
with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The risks described above and in
those filings represent all known material risks with respect to Broadcom’s and VMware’s businesses. See the section
titled “Where You Can Find More Information” for the location of information incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement/prospectus.

which is further described in the section titled “Proposal 4: The Charter Amendment Proposal” and the full

stockholders who held shares of record as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of
and vote at the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting, as long as such shares
remain outstanding on the date of the special meeting. VMware’s official stock ownership records will conclusively
determine whether a stockholder is a “holder of record” as of the record date.

VMware will have technicians ready to assist VMware stockholders with any technical difficulties they may have
accessing the virtual meeting. If VMware stockholders encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual meeting or
during the meeting time, VMware stockholders should navigate to
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VMW2022SM where a phone number for IT support will be posted.
Outstanding Shares as of Record Date
As of the record date, there were 424,475,071 shares of VMware common stock outstanding and owned by
stockholders (i.e., excluding shares of VMware common stock held in treasury by VMware), held by 3,779 holders of
record. Each share of VMware common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter considered at the special meeting.
Stockholders may request an appointment to inspect a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the special
meeting for any purpose germane to the special meeting at VMware’s headquarters located at 3401 Hillview Avenue,
Palo Alto, California, during ordinary business hours within ten days prior to the special meeting by sending an email
request to IR@vmware.com.
Shares and Voting of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of the record date, VMware directors and executive officers, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote
169,663,338 shares of VMware common stock, or approximately 40.0% of the outstanding shares of VMware common
stock. VMware currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the
merger agreement proposal and each of the other proposals described in this proxy statement/prospectus, although
none of the directors and executive officers are obligated to do so, other than Michael S. Dell with respect to the
merger agreement proposal and the adjournment proposal.
Mr. Dell is the current chairman and a member of the VMware board of directors. Further, Egon Durban, a member of
the VMware board of directors, is the Co-Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner of Silver Lake. As noted
above, pursuant to the voting agreements, each of the MSD stockholders and the SL stockholders have agreed to
vote all of the shares of VMware common stock held by them (representing in the aggregate approximately 49.8% of
the total outstanding shares of VMware common stock as of the record date) in favor of the merger agreement
proposal. See the section titled “The Voting Agreements.”
Quorum and Broker Non-Votes
In order to conduct any business at the special meeting, a quorum must be present virtually or represented by proxy.
Holders of shares representing at least a majority of the total outstanding shares of VMware common stock on the
record date entitled to vote at the special meeting, represented virtually or by proxy, constitute a quorum.
Stockholders choosing to abstain from voting will be treated as present for purposes of determining whether a
quorum is present, but will not be counted as votes cast “FOR” any matter.
Banks, brokerage firms and other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for the accounts of their clients may
vote such shares either as directed by their clients or in their own discretion on “routine” matters. When a broker
does not receive instructions from a beneficial owner on how to vote shares with respect to a “non-routine” matter, a
broker “non-vote” occurs. Broker “non-votes” will be treated as present for purposes of determining whether a
quorum is present, but will not be counted as votes cast “FOR” any matter.
Your shares will be counted for purposes of determining if there is a quorum, whether representing votes for, against
or abstained, if you (1) participate in the special meeting, or (2) have voted via the Internet, by telephone or by
properly submitting a proxy card or voting instruction card by mail.
Required Vote
The votes required for each proposal are as follows:
Proposal 1-The Merger Agreement Proposal. The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock entitled to vote on the merger agreement proposal is
required to approve the merger agreement proposal. If you are a VMware stockholder on the record date and take any
action other than voting (or causing your shares to be voted) “FOR” the merger agreement proposal, it will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger agreement proposal. For example, if you fail to instruct your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger agreement
proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Proposal 2-The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of
the shares of VMware common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote on
the merger-related compensation proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the merger-
related compensation proposal. If you are a VMware stockholder on the record date and (i) participate in the special
meeting but fail to vote or (ii) mark your proxy card or voting instruction card to abstain, it will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the merger-related compensation proposal. If you do not (i) participate in the special meeting,
virtually or by proxy, and do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote your shares, it will
have no effect on the merger-related compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
Proposal 3-The Adjournment Proposal. The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the shares of
VMware common stock represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the
adjournment proposal is required to approve the adjournment proposal. If you are a VMware stockholder on the
record date and (i) participate in the special meeting but fail to vote or (ii) mark your proxy card or voting instruction
card to abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adjournment proposal. If you do not (i)
participate in the special meeting, virtually or by proxy, and do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee how to vote your shares, it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
Proposal 4-The Charter Amendment Proposal. The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of holders of at least 67%
of the outstanding shares of VMware common stock entitled to vote on the charter amendment proposal is required
to approve the charter amendment proposal. If you are a VMware stockholder on the record date and take any action
other than voting (or causing your shares to be voted) “FOR” the charter amendment proposal, it will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the charter amendment proposal. For example, if you fail to instruct your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the charter amendment
proposal.
As noted above, pursuant to the voting agreements, each of the MSD stockholders and the SL stockholders have
agreed to vote all of the shares of VMware common stock held by them (representing in the aggregate approximately
49.8% of the total outstanding shares of VMware common stock as of the record date) in favor of the merger
agreement proposal. See the section titled “The Voting Agreements.”
How to Vote or Have Your Shares Voted
VMware stockholders of record may vote their shares of VMware common stock or submit a proxy to have their
shares of VMware common stock voted at the special meeting in one of the following ways:
•
Internet: VMware stockholders may submit their proxy by using the Internet at proxyvote.com. Internet
voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on November 3, 2022,
the day before the special meeting.
•
Telephone: VMware stockholders may submit their proxy by using a touch-tone telephone at 1-800-690-
6903. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on
November 3, 2022, the day before the special meeting.
•
Mail: VMware stockholders may submit their proxy by properly completing, signing, dating and mailing
their proxy card in the postage-paid envelope (if mailed in the United States) included with this proxy
statement/prospectus. VMware stockholders who vote this way should mail the proxy card early enough
so that it is received before the date of the special meeting.
•
To Vote Virtually at the Special Meeting: To vote virtually at the special meeting, visit
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VMW2022SM and enter the 16-digit control number included on your
proxy card or voting instruction card that accompanied your proxy materials.
Whether or not you plan to participate in the special meeting, VMware urges you to submit your proxy by completing
and returning the proxy card as promptly as possible, or by submitting your proxy by telephone or via the Internet,
prior to the special meeting to ensure that your shares of VMware common stock will be represented and voted at the
special meeting if you are unable to participate.
The VMware board of directors has appointed certain persons as proxy holders to vote proxies in accordance with
the instructions of VMware stockholders. If you are a stockholder of record and you authorize
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
these proxy holders to vote your shares of VMware common stock with respect to any matter to be acted upon, your
shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions in your proxy. If you are a stockholder of record and you
authorize these proxy holders to vote your shares but do not specify how your shares should be voted on a
proposal, these proxy holders will vote your shares on such proposals as the VMware board of directors
recommends, except if you indicate that you wish to vote against the merger agreement proposal, in which case your
shares of VMware common stock will only be voted in favor of the merger-related compensation proposal, the
adjournment proposal and the charter amendment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of such
proposals. If any other matter properly comes before the special meeting, these proxy holders will vote on that matter
in their discretion.
If, as of the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock
Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the
proxy notice was sent directly to you by VMware. If, as of the record date, your shares were held in an account at a
bank, brokerage firm or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,”
and the proxy notice was forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is
considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the special meeting. As a beneficial owner, you must
direct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote the shares of VMware common stock held in your
account and you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee describing how to vote
your shares of VMware common stock. The availability of Internet or telephonic voting will depend on the nominee’s
voting process. Please check with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and follow the voting procedures your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee provides.
If you are a beneficial owner and do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee instructions on how to
vote your shares of VMware common stock with respect to “non-routine” matters, a broker “non-vote” occurs with
respect to those matters. Under applicable stock exchange rules, the organization that holds your shares of VMware
common stock (i.e., your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee) may generally vote on routine matters at its
discretion but cannot vote your shares on “non-routine” matters without your instructions. If you are a beneficial
owner and the organization that holds your shares of VMware common stock does not receive instructions from you
on how to vote your shares of VMware common stock on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your
shares of VMware common stock will inform the inspector of elections that it does not have the authority to vote
your shares on such matters. The merger agreement proposal, the merger-related compensation proposal, the
adjournment proposal and the charter amendment proposal will be considered “non-routine.” Accordingly, if you are
a beneficial owner and do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee instructions on how to vote your
shares of VMware common stock, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee generally will not be permitted to vote
your shares on any of the proposals. If you are a beneficial holder, VMware strongly encourages you to provide
voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee so that your vote will be counted on all matters.
If you are a beneficial owner, you are invited to participate in the special meeting; however, you may not vote your
shares at the special meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that
holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the special meeting.
Revocation of Proxies
VMware stockholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time prior to the voting at the special meeting in any
of the following ways:
•
signing and delivering a new proxy relating to the same shares and bearing a later date than the original
proxy;
•
sending a signed, written notice of revocation, which is dated later than the date of the proxy and states
that the proxy is revoked, to Attention: Secretary, VMware, Inc. Legal Department, 3401 Hillview Avenue,
Palo Alto, California 94304; or
•
participating in and voting during the virtual special meeting. Participation in the virtual special meeting will
not, however, in and of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior proxy.
VMware beneficial owners may change their voting instruction only by following the directions received from their
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee for changing their voting instructions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Solicitation of Proxies
VMware will pay for the proxy solicitation costs related to the special meeting. In addition to sending and making
available these materials, some of VMware’s directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies in person by
contacting VMware stockholders by telephone or over the Internet. VMware stockholders may also be solicited by
press releases issued by VMware, postings on VMware’s websites and advertisements in periodicals. None of
VMware’s directors, officers or employees will receive additional compensation for their solicitation services.
VMware has engaged D.F. King to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. VMware estimates that
it will pay D.F. King a fee of approximately $17,500, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Certain banking
institutions, brokerage firms, custodians, trustees, nominees and fiduciaries who hold shares for the benefit of
another party may solicit proxies for VMware. If so, they will mail proxy information to, or otherwise communicate
with, the beneficial owners of shares of VMware common stock held by them. VMware will also reimburse banks,
brokerage firms, custodians, trustees, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses incurred in sending proxies and
proxy materials to beneficial owners of VMware common stock.
Adjournments
The special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting or the holders of shares representing at least a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast by VMware stockholders present virtually or represented by proxy, if
sufficient votes are cast in favor of the adjournment proposal, whether or not there is a quorum.
Notice need not be given of any adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present and vote at such
adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for
more than 30 days, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting. If, after any adjournment, a new record date for the stockholders entitled to vote is
fixed for any adjourned meeting, notice of the place, if any, date, and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present and vote at
such adjourned meeting must be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

As discussed throughout this proxy statement/prospectus, VMware is asking its stockholders to approve the merger
agreement proposal. Pursuant to the merger agreement, (i) Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware, with
VMware surviving the first merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco, (ii) following the effective
time of the first merger, VMware, the surviving company of the first merger, will be converted into a Delaware limited
liability company, (iii) following the effective time of the LLC conversion, Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into
Holdco, with Holdco surviving the second merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom and (iv)
following the effective time of the second merger, Holdco, the surviving company of the second merger, will merge
with and into Merger Sub 3, with Merger Sub 3 surviving the third merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Broadcom. The merger agreement proposal that VMware is asking its stockholders to approve is the adoption of the
merger agreement and approval of the first merger and the second merger. If the transactions are completed, VMware
will cease to be publicly traded and VMware common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and
deregistered under the Exchange Act.
As described in further detail in the sections titled “Questions and Answers,” “Summary,” “The Transactions” and
“The Merger Agreement,” the VMware board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
transactions. For a discussion of certain factors considered by the VMware board of directors in determining to
approve the merger agreement and recommend that VMware stockholders vote for the merger agreement proposal,
see the section titled “The Transactions-VMware’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the VMware
Board of Directors.” A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. You
are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.
The transactions are subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including
approval of the merger agreement proposal by the stockholders of VMware at the special meeting. Accordingly, the
approval of the merger agreement proposal by VMware stockholders is a condition to the obligations of Broadcom
and VMware to complete the transactions.
The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VMware
common stock entitled to vote on the merger agreement proposal is required to approve the merger agreement
proposal.

VMware is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a vote, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, to
approve the compensation payments that may be paid or become payable by VMware to its named executive officers,
as determined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, in connection with the transactions as disclosed in
the section titled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Transactions,” including the table titled “Golden Parachute Compensation” and the
accompanying footnotes, and the related narrative disclosure under the section titled “The Transactions-Interests of
VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” (referred to as the “golden parachute”
compensation), as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act.
Through this proposal, VMware is asking its stockholders to indicate their approval, on an advisory (non-binding)
basis, of the compensation that VMware’s named executive officers will or may be eligible to receive in connection
with the transactions as described in the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus referred to above.
You should carefully review the golden parachute compensation information disclosed in the sections of this proxy
statement/prospectus referred to above. The VMware board of directors unanimously recommends that VMware
stockholders approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of VMware approve, solely on an advisory, non-binding basis, the golden
parachute compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to VMware’s named executive officers in
connection with the transactions, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section titled
“Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Transactions,” including the table titled “Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes, and the
related narrative disclosure under the section titled “The Transactions-Interests of VMware’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Transactions.”
The vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger
agreement proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve
the merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the merger-related compensation
proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either VMware or Broadcom. Accordingly, if the merger agreement
proposal is approved and the transactions are completed, the compensation payments that are contractually required
to be paid by VMware to its named executive officers will or may be paid or become payable, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of VMware stockholders
on the merger-related compensation proposal.
The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the shares of VMware common stock represented at the
special meeting, virtually or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the merger-related compensation proposal at the special
meeting is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the merger-related compensation proposal.

VMware stockholders are being asked to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement proposal at the time of the special
meeting.
If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that you
wish to vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal but do not indicate a choice on the adjournment proposal,
your shares of VMware common stock will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. If you indicate, however,
that you wish to vote against the merger agreement proposal, your shares of VMware common stock will only be

be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use.

VMware is asking its stockholders to approve the charter amendment, which eliminates the personal liability of
VMware’s officers for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as an officer, except to the extent such an
exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL.
In accordance with Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, VMware’s certificate of incorporation currently contains a
provision eliminating the personal liability of VMware’s directors for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty
as a director, except to the extent such an exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL.
Pursuant to a recent amendment to Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL that became effective on August 1, 2022, a
Delaware corporation is now permitted to similarly eliminate or limit such personal liability of its officers. The effect of
the charter amendment is to limit the ability of VMware’s stockholders to seek monetary damages directly against
VMware’s officers. However, this provision does not limit VMware’s rights or the rights of any VMware stockholder
to seek monetary damages against an officer for a breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or
which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, transactions in which an officer derives an
improper personal benefit, or any actions brought by VMware directly against the officer or by any of VMware’s
stockholders through a derivative suit on VMware’s behalf. If the charter amendment is adopted, VMware’s officers
that would be subject to this provision include its chief executive officer, president, chief operating officer, chief
financial officer, chief legal officer, chief accounting officer, its most highly compensated executive officers as
identified in its SEC filings and certain other officers who have consented (or are deemed to have consented) to
service by the delivery of process to VMware’s registered agent in accordance with Delaware law. If the charter
amendment is adopted, it will not eliminate or limit the liability of an officer for any act or omission occurring prior to
the date on which it becomes effective.
When considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors that VMware stockholders approve the
charter amendment proposal, VMware stockholders should be aware that directors and executive officers of VMware
have certain interests in the charter amendment proposal that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
VMware stockholders more generally. Specifically, Raghu Raghuram, a member of VMware’s board of directors and
the chief executive officer of VMware, as well as certain other officers of VMware, will receive the liability exculpation
protections afforded by the charter amendment if it is adopted by VMware’s stockholders. The VMware board of
directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching its decision to approve
the charter amendment.
The VMware board of directors has approved, adopted, authorized and declared advisable the charter amendment
proposal. The foregoing description of the charter amendment proposal should be read in connection with the full
text of the charter amendment, which is set forth in the proposed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
of VMware (with additions shown as underlined and deletions shown as struck through), which is attached as Annex
G to this proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the charter amendment carefully and in its entirety.
The vote on the charter amendment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger agreement
proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the charter
amendment proposal and vice versa.
The affirmative vote, virtually or by proxy, of the holders of at least 67% of the outstanding shares of VMware
common stock entitled to vote on the charter amendment proposal is required to approve and adopt the charter
amendment proposal. If the charter amendment proposal is approved and adopted by the VMware stockholders at
the special meeting, VMware intends to file the proposed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware promptly
following the conclusion of the special meeting.
THE VMWARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT VMWARE STOCKHOLDERS
VOTE “FOR” THE CHARTER AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.

Effects of the Transactions
Broadcom and VMware, among others, have entered into the merger agreement, pursuant to which, through a series
of transactions, VMware will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.
First Merger and LLC Conversion
Upon satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions, Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware (referred to as
the first merger). VMware will be the surviving company in the first merger and become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdco. At the effective time of the first merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger will be converted into one share of common stock of Holdco,
and each outstanding VMware equity award will be converted into a Holdco award that relates to a number of shares
of Holdco common stock that is equal to the number of shares of VMware common stock that were subject to such
award prior to such conversion. All terms and conditions applicable to each such VMware security (including any
VMware equity awards) immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger will, except as described in the
immediately preceding sentence, remain in effect immediately after the effective time of the first merger. After the
consummation of the first merger, all references in this proxy statement/prospectus to VMware, including VMware
common stock, VMware stock options, VMware restricted stock unit awards, VMware equity awards and other
securities of VMware will be deemed, where applicable, to be references to Holdco and the same securities of Holdco,
and all references to VMware stockholders will be deemed to be references to common stockholders of Holdco.
Immediately after the consummation of the first merger, VMware will be converted into a Delaware limited liability
company (referred to as the LLC conversion) and will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Merger Consideration
Upon completion of the second merger, each issued and outstanding share of VMware common stock (other than (i)
cancelled shares, (ii) dissenting shares and (iii) excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder of such share and subject to proration, $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.25200 of a share of
Broadcom common stock. VMware stockholder may elect a different form of consideration for each share such
VMware stockholder owns. VMware stockholders may elect to receive (i) solely the cash consideration, (ii) solely the
stock consideration or (iii) if VMware stockholders own more than one share, a combination of the cash
consideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the remaining number of shares. No
fractional shares of Broadcom common stock will be issued in the second merger, and holders of VMware common
stock will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom common stock.
The merger consideration is subject to proration so that 50% of VMware common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger will be converted into cash consideration and 50% will be
converted into stock consideration, based on an exchange ratio of 0.25200 of a share of Broadcom common stock. For
example, if you elect to receive solely the cash consideration or solely the stock consideration, and all other VMware
stockholders make the same election, the consideration you receive will vary to the maximum extent possible
compared to your original election. In such instance, you would receive the cash consideration in exchange for 50%
of your shares of VMware common stock and the stock consideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware
common stock. The following examples illustrate the proration mechanism in the case of an oversubscription of either
the cash consideration or the stock consideration (both if you elect solely the oversubscribed form of merger
consideration and if you elect a combination of the cash consideration and the stock consideration). Note that for
illustrative purposes, the following examples do not round shares to the nearest whole number.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the cash consideration, and
80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect
to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,
you will receive cash in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common
stock in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 55 shares
and the stock consideration for 45 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware share select to receive
cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the
outstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 34.375 of your
shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 65.625 of your shares of
VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the stock consideration, and
80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding
VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,
you will receive cash in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common
stock in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 45 shares
and the stock consideration for 55 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive
Broadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the
outstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 65.625 of your
shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 34.375 of your shares of
VMware common stock.
Holders of VMware common stock who do not make an election will be treated as having elected to receive cash
consideration or stock consideration in accordance with the proration methodology in the merger agreement.
Based on the number of shares of VMware common stock outstanding as of September 12, 2022, plus shares of
VMware common stock that may be delivered pursuant to unvested equity awards and equity awards that may be
issued through the completion of the second merger, Broadcom would issue up to approximately 58,548,216 shares of
Broadcom common stock to VMware stockholders pursuant to the second merger. The actual number of shares of
Broadcom common stock to be issued pursuant to the second merger will be
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
determined at completion of the second merger based on the exchange ratio and the number of shares of VMware
common stock outstanding at such time. Based on up to 58,548,216 shares of Broadcom common stock that may be
issued to VMware stockholders, and the number of shares of Broadcom common stock outstanding as of September
12, 2022, immediately after completion of the second merger, former VMware stockholders would own approximately
12.6% of the outstanding shares of Broadcom common stock.
On September 30, 2022 (the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus), the
closing stock price per share of Broadcom common stock was $444.01, which, after giving effect to the exchange ratio
of 0.25200, has an implied value of approximately $111.89 per share. Based on this price, with respect to the stock
consideration and the cash consideration of $142.50 per share, upon completion of the transactions, VMware
stockholders that receive the cash consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock and receive the
stock consideration for 50% of their shares of VMware common stock would receive total merger consideration with
an implied value of approximately $127.20 per share.
The implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate, however, as the market price of Broadcom common stock
fluctuates because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Broadcom common stock. As a
result, the value of the stock consideration that VMware stockholders will receive upon completion of the second
merger could be greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, at the time of the VMware special meeting or on the date on which VMware stockholders make
their election. Accordingly, VMware and Broadcom encourage you to obtain current stock price quotations for
Broadcom common stock and VMware common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to approval of the
merger agreement proposal.
Background of the Transactions
VMware’s senior management and the VMware board of directors regularly review VMware’s performance, strategy,
competitive position, opportunities and prospects in light of current business and economic environments and
developments in the software industry and the opportunities and challenges facing participants in the industry.
These reviews have included consideration by VMware’s senior management and the VMware board of directors of
potential strategic alternatives, including acquisitions, business combinations and other strategic transactions.
However, VMware’s recent focus, both before and after the VMware spin-off on November 1, 2021, had been on
executing its standalone plan.
On April 26, 2022, the assistant to Hock E. Tan, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Broadcom, contacted the
assistant to Michael S. Dell, the Chairman of the VMware board of directors and a large VMware stockholder, to
request a meeting between Mr. Tan and Mr. Dell. The topic of the meeting was not specified. Mr. Tan’s and Mr. Dell’s
assistants scheduled the meeting for May 6, 2022. At the May 6 meeting, Mr. Tan told Mr. Dell that Broadcom would
be interested in a potential combination with VMware on a friendly basis. Mr. Tan and Mr. Dell discussed Broadcom’s
strategic rationale with respect to such a transaction, but did not discuss the price or any other terms of a potential
transaction. Mr. Dell suggested that Mr. Tan also have a discussion with Egon Durban, a member of the VMware
board of directors and the Co-Chief Executive Officer of Silver Lake, another large stockholder of VMware, to discuss
a potential transaction. Silver Lake was formerly an investor in Broadcom until 2019. Following the meeting, Mr. Dell
contacted Paul Sagan, the lead independent director of the VMware board of directors, as well as Mr. Durban, and
informed them each of the discussion with Mr. Tan. Additionally, on May 6, 2022, following the meeting with Mr. Dell,
Mr. Tan placed a telephone call to Mr. Durban to arrange a subsequent conversation regarding a potential
transaction. On May 7, 2022, Mr. Tan and Mr. Durban discussed a potential transaction by telephone and, on May 12,
2022, Mr. Tan met with Mr. Durban, along with executives of Silver Lake and Broadcom, to discuss a potential
transaction.
On May 13, 2022, Broadcom delivered an unsolicited confidential proposal letter (referred to as the May 13 Letter) to
Messrs. Dell, Durban and Sagan, proposing the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom in a cash and stock transaction.
The May 13 Letter was addressed to the VMware board of directors, and was promptly made available to the entire
VMware board of directors. The May 13 Letter noted that Broadcom was prepared to offer VMware stockholders
$142.50 per share of VMware common stock, in the form of either $142.50 in cash or 0.2422 shares of Broadcom
common stock, at the election of each VMware stockholder and subject to proration so that the total transaction
consideration would be 50% cash and 50% stock. The May 13 Letter also noted that the proposed transaction would
not be subject to Broadcom stockholder approval nor a financing condition and would be funded through a
combination of cash on hand and committed debt financing. The May 13 Letter also
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
included letters from each of Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley providing that the foregoing banks
were highly confident that they would be able to arrange the necessary debt financing. Broadcom also indicated in
the May 13 Letter its desire to move quickly toward a definitive agreement with VMware, with announcement of a
transaction to coincide with VMware’s scheduled earnings announcement on May 26, 2022, and stated that
Broadcom was prepared to provide for a go-shop period immediately following execution of the definitive agreement,
on customary terms. Broadcom also requested that VMware provide Dell with the requisite tax opinion required by
the tax matters agreement between VMware and Dell in order for VMware to engage in a proposed transaction with
Broadcom, in form and substance satisfactory to Dell, VMware and Broadcom, prior to the signing of a definitive
agreement with VMware. Broadcom also expressed its expectation that Mr. Dell and Silver Lake would enter into
voting agreements to support the transaction and indicated that Broadcom would offer a member of the VMware
board of directors, with such member to be mutually agreed by Broadcom and VMware, a seat on the Broadcom
board of directors, effective upon the closing of the proposed transaction. Together with the May 13 Letter,
Broadcom delivered a mutual non-disclosure agreement and a high-priority diligence request list.
On May 15, 2022, the VMware board of directors met with representatives of VMware management, as well as
representatives of J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Gibson Dunn. During the meeting, the VMware board of directors
reviewed the terms of the May 13 Letter with VMware management and its advisors. The VMware board of directors
discussed its fiduciary duties in connection with the review of an unsolicited proposal and the fiduciary duties that
may apply to the transaction proposed in the May 13 Letter. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs also
made a presentation regarding the proposal in the May 13 Letter from a financial perspective based upon publicly
available market information. After discussion, the VMware board of directors determined to continue discussions
with Broadcom. In addition, the VMware board of directors established a committee comprised of Mr. Dell, Mr.
Durban, Karen E. Dykstra, a member of the VMware board of directors, and Mr. Sagan (referred to as the VMware
transaction committee) for administrative efficiency purposes, with authority to, among other things, review, evaluate,
consider, investigate, discuss, negotiate and determine the advisability of any potential strategic alternatives
available to VMware, including a potential business combination with Broadcom. The VMware transaction committee
was also authorized to recommend to the full VMware board of directors what action or actions should be taken with
respect to a potential transaction, which could include a recommendation that the full VMware board of directors
reject the proposal from Broadcom. It was noted that the full VMware board of directors retained authority with
respect to approval of any proposed transaction. It was also understood that the VMware board of directors would
continue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic transactions and that each director would be invited
to all meetings of the VMware transaction committee. The VMware board of directors did not provide for the payment
of any compensation to the members of the VMware transaction committee in consideration of their service on the
committee (other than, for Ms. Dykstra and Mr. Sagan, their ordinary-course compensation as members of the
VMware board of directors).
Later on May 15, 2022, at the direction of the VMware board of directors, Mr. Durban spoke with Tom Krause,
President of Broadcom Software Group, to coordinate due diligence meetings for the upcoming week and to discuss
the process for preparing the initial draft of the merger agreement.
Also on May 15, 2022, representatives of Gibson Dunn delivered a revised draft of the non-disclosure agreement to
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, legal counsel to Broadcom (referred to as Wachtell Lipton).
On May 16, 2022, the VMware transaction committee met with other members of the VMware board of directors and
representatives of VMware management, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Gibson Dunn and Silver Lake. Mr. Durban
provided an update on his discussion with Mr. Krause, and the VMware transaction committee discussed the
upcoming due diligence meetings with Broadcom, including regarding VMware’s reverse due diligence on Broadcom
in light of the stock component of the proposed consideration.
On May 16, 2022, following the meeting of the VMware transaction committee, VMware and Broadcom executed the
non-disclosure agreement, which contained a customary mutual standstill provision.
Later on May 16, 2022, representatives of VMware and Broadcom commenced due diligence, which included in-
person meetings between the parties and their respective representatives at Silver Lake’s offices.

performing their preliminary financial analyses.
On May 21, 2022, the VMware board of directors met with representatives of VMware management, J.P. Morgan,
Goldman Sachs, Gibson Dunn and Silver Lake. At this meeting, the VMware board of directors was provided with

Also on May 23, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton transmitted a revised draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Gibson Dunn. Between May 23, 2022 and May 26, 2022, representatives of Broadcom, VMware,
Silver Lake, Wachtell Lipton, Gibson Dunn and Simpson Thacher exchanged drafts of, and had multiple conference
calls to discuss and resolve the open items in, the draft merger agreement, draft voting agreements and related
documentation. A separate team at Wachtell Lipton representing Mr. Dell, with the consent of the parties, was

TABLE OF CONTENTS
2022 and May 26, 2022, legal executives at Broadcom and Silver Lake also had multiple discussions, including about
certain matters in the draft merger agreement, such as regulatory approval requirements, and VMware employee
matters, such as change of control and severance protections and a cash retention program to retain key VMware

Dunn also reviewed the open issues in the revised draft merger agreement from Wachtell Lipton, including, among
other things, (i) the deletion of the reverse termination fee payable by Broadcom in connection with regulatory
review, (ii) a more limited divestiture obligation on Broadcom in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals
providing that no divestiture would be required if such divestiture was with respect to assets, products or
businesses of Broadcom not included in the Broadcom Software Group and (iii) the increased termination fee payable
by VMware during the 40-day go-shop period of $900 million, with a termination fee payable by VMware of $1.8
billion thereafter in connection with any termination for a superior proposal.
On May 24, 2022, the VMware board of directors met with representatives of VMware management, J.P. Morgan,
Goldman Sachs, Gibson Dunn, Silver Lake and Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider LLP (referred to as Axinn), co-counsel to
VMware regarding regulatory matters. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs reviewed with the VMware
board of directors the potential go-shop process, including potential counterparties to contact, including certain key
metrics for each party and the potential strategic rationale for a potential combination and potential considerations
each potential party may have regarding a potential transaction. Mr. Rangarajan (Raghu) Raghuram, Chief Executive
Officer of VMware, noted that a senior executive of a large publicly traded corporation (referred to as Party B) had
reached out following the news reports regarding a potential Broadcom transaction and expressed interest in a
potential transaction. Mr. Dell noted that he had interacted with another senior executive of Party B in Davos the day
prior and such executive did not mention anything regarding a potential transaction. The VMware board of directors
discussed the terms of a revised draft merger agreement to be transmitted to Broadcom, including (i) reinserting the
reverse termination fee payable by Broadcom in the amount of $1.8 billion, which was the same amount as the post-
go-shop termination fee payable by VMware, (ii) revising the go-shop termination fee payable by VMware to $700
million, which was between VMware’s initial $500 million go-shop termination fee proposal and Broadcom’s $900
million counterproposal and (iii) accepting that Broadcom would not be required to make regulatory divestitures if
such divested asset, product or business was not included in the Broadcom Software Group. Representatives of
Gibson Dunn also discussed VMware’s and Broadcom’s representations, warranties and interim operating covenants
and other terms.
Following the meeting of the VMware board of directors, on May 24, 2022, representatives of Gibson Dunn
transmitted a revised draft merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton.

Early in the morning on May 25, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton transmitted a further revised draft of the
merger agreement to Gibson Dunn.
Later in the morning on May 25, 2022, the VMware board of directors met with representatives of VMware
management, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Gibson Dunn, Silver Lake and Axinn. Among other things, representatives
of Gibson Dunn reviewed the open items in the draft merger agreement and potential resolutions. The VMware board
of directors discussed the terms of a revised draft merger agreement to be transmitted to Broadcom, including
accepting a lowered reverse termination fee of $1.5 billion, the same amount as the proposed post-go-shop
termination fee payable by VMware, accepting an increased go-shop termination fee of $750 million, but continuing
to negotiate to expand the obligations on Broadcom to seek regulatory approvals and narrow the limitations on such
obligations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Following the meeting of the VMware board of directors, on May 25, 2022, representatives of Gibson Dunn
transmitted a further revised draft of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton.
Later on May 25, 2022, the VMware board of directors met with representatives of VMware management, J.P. Morgan,
Goldman Sachs, Silver Lake, Gibson Dunn and Axinn to discuss the status of the negotiation of the merger agreement
and open issues. The representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan reviewed with the VMware board of
directors Goldman Sachs’ and J.P. Morgan’s respective financial analyses of the aggregate merger consideration to be
paid to the holders of shares of VMware common stock (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) pursuant to the
merger agreement. The VMware board of directors noted the customary relationship disclosures previously provided
by Goldman Sachs regarding Goldman Sachs’ relationships with VMware, Broadcom and MSD Capital L.P. and Silver
Lake and their respective affiliates and the customary relationship disclosures previously provided by J.P. Morgan
regarding their relationships with VMware, Broadcom and Silver Lake and the VMware board of directors did not
identify any concerns with these disclosures. The representatives of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan each discussed
the procedures and process in connection with delivery of their respective opinions, assuming successful completion
of the negotiations and finalization of the terms of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.
Representatives of Gibson Dunn also reviewed the key terms of the merger agreement and the voting agreements to
be entered into by each of the MSD stockholders and the SL stockholders.
Early in the morning on May 26, 2022, the VMware board of directors met with representatives of VMware
management, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Gibson Dunn, Silver Lake and Axinn. Representatives of Gibson Dunn
reviewed with the VMware board of directors their fiduciary duties in the context of considering the proposed
transaction. Representatives of Gibson Dunn also provided an update on the negotiation of the merger agreement
and related transaction documents, including updates to the final terms of the merger agreement since the earlier
meeting of the VMware board of directors on May 25. The representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan
again reviewed with the VMware board of directors Goldman Sachs’ and J.P. Morgan’s respective financial analyses
of the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of VMware common stock (other than
Broadcom and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement. The representatives of Goldman Sachs then rendered
the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May 26, 2022, to
the VMware board of directors that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the various
limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to the
holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The representatives of J.P. Morgan then also
rendered the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated May 26,
2022 to the VMware board of directors that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various
limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid to holders of
VMware common stock in the transactions was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following
discussion, and taking into consideration various factors, including those described in the section titled “-VMware’s
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the VMware Board of Directors,” the VMware board of directors
unanimously (i) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best
interests of, VMware and the VMware stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the
VMware stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii) approved the execution and
delivery by VMware of the merger agreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements
contained therein and the consummation of the transactions substantially upon the terms and conditions set forth in
the merger agreement and (iv) resolved to recommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger
agreement.
Before the opening of New York Stock Exchange normal trading hours on May 26, 2022, the applicable parties
executed the merger agreement and the voting agreements, Broadcom delivered to VMware fully executed versions of
the debt commitment letter and Gibson Dunn delivered the legal opinion required by the tax matters agreement
between VMware and Dell for VMware to engage in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Promptly following execution of the merger agreement, VMware and Broadcom publicly announced the merger
agreement.
Later on May 26, 2022, in accordance with the go-shop provisions in the merger agreement, at the direction of the
VMware board of directors, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs began contacting parties about their
interest in participating in the go-shop process. During the go-shop period, representatives of
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs contacted 10 potential strategic acquirors (including Party A and Party B). Of such
contacted parties, two potential strategic acquirors executed acceptable confidentiality agreements. During the go-
shop period, VMware provided confidential information in response to due diligence inquiries made by these two
potential strategic acquirors. At 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on July 5, 2022, the go-shop period expired without any party
submitting a proposal to acquire VMware.
VMware’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the VMware Board of Directors
At its May 26, 2022 meeting held to evaluate the transactions, the VMware board of directors unanimously (i)
determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best interests, of
VMware and the VMware stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the VMware
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii) approved the execution and delivery
by VMware of the merger agreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements contained therein
and the consummation of the transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement and (iv) resolved to recommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.
Additionally, the VMware board of directors has approved, adopted, authorized and declared advisable the charter
amendment. The VMware board of directors recommends that VMware stockholders vote:
1.
“FOR” the merger agreement proposal;
2.
“FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal;
3.
“FOR” the adjournment proposal; and
4.
“FOR” the charter amendment proposal.
In evaluating the transactions and the merger agreement and arriving at its determination, the VMware board of
directors consulted with VMware’s senior management, representatives of VMware’s financial advisors, Goldman
Sachs and J.P. Morgan and VMware’s outside legal counsel, Gibson Dunn, and considered a number of substantive
factors, both positive and negative, and potential benefits and detriments of the transactions to VMware and its
stockholders. The VMware board of directors believed that, taken as a whole, the following factors supported its
decision to approve the transactions:
•
Merger Consideration. The value of the merger consideration to be received by VMware stockholders in
relation to the market prices of VMware common stock prior to the VMware board of directors’ approval of
the merger agreement.
•
Premium to Trading Price of VMware Common Stock. The fact that the implied value per share of VMware
common stock of $142.50 assuming a cash election and no proration, the implied value per share of VMware
common stock of $136.88 assuming a stock election and no proration and a blended value per share of
VMware common stock of $139.69 (assuming proration of 50% cash and 50% equity based on the treatment
of VMware common stock, stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units pursuant to
the merger agreement), each calculated as of May 20, 2022 (the last trading day prior to market speculation
regarding the transactions), represented a premium of 49%, 43% and 46%, respectively, over the closing
price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on May 20, 2022. The VMware board of directors also
considered the fact that the implied value per share of VMware common stock of $142.50 assuming a cash
election and no proration, the implied value per share of VMware common stock of $132.10 assuming a
stock election and no proration and a blended value per share of VMware common stock of $137.30
(assuming proration of 50% cash and 50% equity based on the treatment of VMware common stock, stock
options, restricted stock units and performance stock units pursuant to the merger agreement), each
calculated as of May 24, 2022, represented a premium of 49%, 38% and 43%, respectively, over the closing
price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on May 20, 2022.
•
Uncertainty of Future Common Stock Market Price. The uncertainty of VMware’s future stock market price
if VMware remained independent. The VMware board of directors considered VMware’s business, assets,
financial condition, results of operations, management, competitive position and prospects, as well as
current industry, economic and stock and credit market conditions. The VMware board of directors also
considered VMware’s long range plan and the initiatives and the potential
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
execution risks associated with such plan. In connection with these considerations, the VMware board of
directors considered the attendant risk that if VMware remained independent, VMware common stock
might not trade at levels equal to or greater than the value of the merger consideration in the near term,
over an extended period of time or at all.
•
Negotiations with Broadcom. The benefits that VMware and its advisors were able to obtain during its
negotiations with Broadcom. The VMware board of directors believed that the consideration reflected in
the merger agreement was the best transaction that could be obtained by VMware stockholders at the time,
and that there was no assurance that a more favorable opportunity to sell VMware would arise later or
through any alternative transaction.
•
Stockholder Election Opportunity. The fact that VMware stockholders would have the right to elect to
receive the merger consideration either in cash or shares of Broadcom common stock, subject to proration.
•
Significant Portion of Merger Consideration in Cash. The fact that 50% of the merger consideration will be
paid in cash, giving VMware stockholders the opportunity to immediately realize value for a significant
portion of their investment and providing certainty of value. The VMware board of directors also
considered the fact that VMware stockholders would be able to reinvest the cash consideration received in
the transactions in shares of Broadcom common stock if they desired to do so.
•
Participation in Potential Upside. The benefits of Broadcom that could result from the transactions,
including the potential to realize synergies. The VMware board of directors also considered the fact that,
since a portion of the merger consideration will be paid in shares of Broadcom common stock, VMware
stockholders will benefit from an approximately 12% pro forma continuing equity ownership in Broadcom
(based on share data of VMware and Broadcom on May 24, 2022) and have the opportunity to participate
in any future earnings or growth of Broadcom and future appreciation in the value of Broadcom common
stock following the transactions should they determine to retain the shares of Broadcom common stock
payable in the transactions.
•
Fixed Exchange Ratio for Stock Portion of Merger Consideration. The fact that because the stock
consideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.25200 of a share of Broadcom common stock, VMware
stockholders receiving a portion of the merger consideration in shares of Broadcom common stock will
have the opportunity to benefit from any increase in the trading price of shares of Broadcom common stock
between the announcement of the merger agreement and the completion of the transactions and that the
cash portion of the merger consideration will limit the impact of a decline in the trading price of Broadcom
common stock on the aggregate value of the merger consideration.
•
Tax Treatment. The fact that the transactions are intended to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, as
described in greater detail under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”
•
Expected Cost Synergies. The expectation that Broadcom will recognize anticipated cost synergies
following consummation of the transactions, which VMware stockholders will benefit from as continuing
stockholders of Broadcom. The VMware board of directors also considered that there could be no
assurance that any particular amount of such synergies would be achieved following completion of the
transactions or the timeframe in which they would be achieved.
•
Financial Analyses and Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The oral opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the
VMware board of directors, subsequently confirmed by delivery of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs,
dated May 26, 2022, that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the various
limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the aggregate merger consideration to be paid
to the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The opinion is more fully
described in the section titled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs” and the full text of the opinion is attached as
Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus. The VMware board of directors considered that Goldman
Sachs, in connection with delivering its opinion, performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses
described in the section titled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs.”
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Financial Analyses and Opinion of J.P. Morgan. The oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the VMware
board of directors on May 26, 2022, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion,
dated May 26, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various limitations,
qualifications and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to holders of
VMware common stock in the transactions was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The
opinion is more fully described in the section titled “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan” and the full text of the
opinion is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus. The VMware board of directors
considered that J.P. Morgan, in connection with delivering its opinion, performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses described in the section titled “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan.”
•
Likelihood of Consummation. The likelihood that the transactions would be completed, in light of, among
other things, the conditions to the transactions, the absence of a financing condition, and the efforts
required to obtain regulatory approvals.
•
Board Representation. The fact that one member of the VMware board of directors, to be mutually agreed
by VMware and Broadcom, will join the Broadcom board of directors.
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including:
•
the representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, the conditions to the parties’ obligations
to complete the transactions and their ability to terminate the merger agreement;
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit VMware, during a 40-day go-shop period, to solicit
alternative proposals from third parties;
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that allow VMware to engage in negotiations with, and
provide information to, a third party that makes a written bona fide acquisition proposal following the
go-shop period that did not result from a breach of VMware’s non-solicitation obligations, if the
VMware board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a transaction that is superior to the transactions and VMware complies with certain procedural
requirements;
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that allow the VMware board of directors to change its
recommendation in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal
and terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal if the VMware board of
directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that an acquisition proposal is a superior proposal and, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the VMware board of directors’ fiduciary duties (including taking into account any modifications to
the terms of the merger agreement that are proposed by Broadcom and, in connection with the
termination of the merger agreement, payment to Broadcom of a $750 million termination fee for
termination during the go-shop period or a $1.5 billion termination fee for termination following the go-
shop period), subject to VMware’s compliance with certain procedural requirements;
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that allow the VMware board of directors to change its
recommendation in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement (other than in response to the
receipt of a written bona fide acquisition proposal, which is subject to the preceding sub-bullet above)
if the VMware board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
directors’ fiduciary duties (including taking into account any modifications to the terms of the merger
agreement that are proposed by Broadcom), subject to VMware’s compliance with certain procedural
requirements;
•
the belief of the VMware board of directors that the payment of either the $1.5 billion termination fee
or the $750 million termination fee, as applicable, were not likely to unduly discourage competing third-
party proposals or reduce the price of such proposals and that the lower
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
$750 million termination fee would make it more likely for potential acquirors to consider making a
superior proposal, that such termination fees and provisions are customary for transactions of this
size and type, and that the sizes of the respective termination fees were reasonable in the context of
comparable transactions;
•
the fact that upon termination of the merger agreement in certain circumstances, Broadcom would be
required to pay to VMware a $1.5 billion termination fee that would help offset some of the costs of
the transaction; and
•
the ability of VMware to specifically enforce the terms of the merger agreement.
•
Timing Considerations. The belief of the VMware board of directors that the benefits of soliciting interest
from other potential parties were outweighed by a number of risks, including that such solicitation would
further increase market speculation and jeopardize or, at a minimum, delay the transactions. The VMware
board of directors also observed that VMware had the right to solicit alternative proposals during the go-
shop period and that VMware retained the ability to consider unsolicited proposals after the go-shop
period until the meeting of the VMware stockholders to vote on the merger agreement proposal and to
enter into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal under certain circumstances (concurrently
with terminating the merger agreement and paying the $1.5 billion termination fee or the $750 million
termination fee, as applicable).
•
Strategic Benefits. The VMware board of directors considered that the transactions are expected to provide
a number of significant strategic opportunities, including the following (not necessarily listed in order of
relative importance):
•
the transaction would synergistically combine VMware’s proven technology offerings with
Broadcom’s broader capabilities. Broadcom would facilitate a diversity of service offerings, client
relationships, geographies and end markets and offer enterprise customers greater choice, value and
flexibility to address complex IT infrastructure challenges;
•
the complementary nature of each company’s solutions and platforms; and
•
the expectation that the transactions would result in a company with increased capabilities and world-
class products in core market segments that will be uniquely positioned to serve, facilitate and power
the markets of the future.
•
Broadcom’s Business and Reputation. The results of the due diligence investigation that VMware’s senior
management conducted with the assistance of its advisors on Broadcom with respect to certain matters and
Broadcom’s business reputation and capabilities of Broadcom and its management. The VMware board of
directors also considered Broadcom’s strong track record as an experienced acquirer, which is likely to
facilitate an effective and timely integration of VMware’s business and operations.
•
Financing Strength of Broadcom. The fact that Broadcom has obtained committed debt financing for the
transactions from reputable financial institutions and likelihood that Broadcom would be able to finance the
transactions given Broadcom’s financial resources and financial profile.
•
Availability of Appraisal Rights. The fact that appraisal rights would be available to holders of VMware
common stock under Delaware law and that there was no condition in the merger agreement relating to the
maximum number of shares of VMware common stock that could exercise appraisal rights.
•
MSD Stockholders and SL Stockholders Voting Agreements. The support of the transactions by the MSD
stockholders and the SL stockholders, as evidenced by the execution of the voting agreements.
The VMware board of directors also considered certain potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning
the transactions, including the following:
•
Fixed Stock Ratio of Merger Consideration. The fact that because the stock portion of the merger
consideration is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Broadcom common stock to VMware common stock,
VMware stockholders could be adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of Broadcom common
stock during the pendency of the transactions and the fact that the merger
60
TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreement does not provide VMware with a termination right or other similar protection relating to the
trading price of Broadcom common stock. The VMware board of directors determined that this structure
was appropriate and the risk acceptable in view of factors such as:
•
the VMware board of directors’ review of the relative intrinsic values and financial performance of
Broadcom and VMware; and
•
the fact that VMware stockholders may elect cash consideration, subject to proration, which limits the
impact of a decline in the trading price of Broadcom common stock on the value of the merger
consideration.
•
Possible Failure to Achieve Synergies. The risk that the potential benefits and synergies sought in the
transactions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, and the risk
associated with the integration by Broadcom of VMware.
•
Smaller Ongoing Equity Participation in Broadcom by VMware Stockholders. The fact that because only
50% of the merger consideration will be in the form of Broadcom common stock, VMware stockholders will
have a smaller ongoing equity participation in Broadcom (and, as a result, a smaller opportunity to
participate in any future earnings or growth of Broadcom and future appreciation in the value of Broadcom
common stock following the completion of the transactions) than they have in VMware.
•
Risk of Non-Completion. The possibility that the transactions might not be completed, including as a result
of the failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the failure of VMware stockholders to approve the merger
agreement proposal, and the effect the resulting public announcement of the termination of the merger
agreement may have on:
•
the trading price of VMware common stock; and
•
VMware’s business and operating results, particularly in light of the costs incurred in connection with
the transactions.
•
Possible Deterrence of Competing Offers. The risk that various provisions of the merger agreement,
including the requirement that VMware must pay to Broadcom a termination fee of either $750 million if the
merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances during the go-shop period or $1.5 billion if the
merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances following the expiration of the go-shop period,
may discourage other parties potentially interested in an acquisition of, or combination with, VMware from
pursuing that opportunity.
•
Possible Disruption of the Business and Costs and Expenses. The possible disruption to VMware’s
business that may result from the transactions, the resulting distraction of VMware’s management and
potential attrition of VMware’s employees, as well as the costs and expenses associated with completing
the transactions.
•
Restrictions on Operation of VMware’s Business. The requirement that VMware conduct its business in a
commercially reasonable manner and in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice prior to completion of the transactions.
•
Impact of Announcement. The uncertainty about the effect of the transactions, regardless of whether the
transactions are completed, on VMware’s employees, customers and other parties, may impair VMware’s
ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers and others to
seek to change existing business relationships with VMware, and the potential for litigation arising in
connection with the transactions.
•
Need to Obtain Required Regulatory Clearances. The fact that completion of the transactions would require
approval, or expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, under the HSR Act and other
applicable non-U.S. antitrust laws.
•
Other Risks. The risks described under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 27.
The VMware board of directors concluded that the potentially negative factors associated with the transactions were
significantly outweighed by the potential benefits that it expected the VMware stockholders
61
TABLE OF CONTENTS
would achieve as a result of the transactions, including the belief of the VMware board of directors that the
transactions would maximize the immediate value of VMware stockholders’ shares and minimize the risks and
uncertainty affecting the future prospects of VMware, including the potential execution risks associated with its
stand-alone financial plan. Accordingly, the VMware board of directors unanimously (i) determined that the terms of
the merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best interests, of VMware and the VMware
stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the VMware stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii) approved the execution and delivery by VMware of the merger
agreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of
the transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and (iv) resolved to
recommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.
In addition, the VMware board of directors was aware of and considered the interests that VMware’s directors and
executive officers may have with respect to the transactions that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of
stockholders of VMware generally, as described under “-Interests of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Transactions.”
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the VMware board of directors is not
exhaustive, but VMware believes it includes all the material factors considered by the VMware board of directors. In
view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the transactions and the
complexity of these matters, the VMware board of directors did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to,
quantify or otherwise assign relative or specific weight or values to any of these factors. Rather, the VMware board
of directors viewed its position and recommendation as being based on an overall analysis and on the totality of the
information presented to and factors considered by it. In addition, in considering the factors described above,
individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The VMware board of directors based its
unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented.
This explanation of VMware’s reasons for the transactions and other information presented in this section is forward-
looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors described under “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware’s Financial Advisors
While VMware has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, VMware’s management does
not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to future performance due
to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood
that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized. In connection with the transactions, VMware
provided certain unaudited non-public financial projections regarding VMware to the VMware board of directors,
which are referred to as the “VMware management financial projections.” At the direction of the VMware board of
directors, the VMware management financial projections were also provided to, and approved for use by, Goldman
Sachs and J.P. Morgan for purposes of performing their respective financial analyses in connection with rendering
their respective opinions to the VMware board of directors (as more fully described in the sections titled “-Opinion of
Goldman Sachs” and “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan”). In addition, VMware management provided to the VMware board of
directors, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan certain unaudited non-public financial projections for Broadcom, which
were informed by Wall Street consensus estimates for Broadcom and due diligence discussions between VMware’s
management and Broadcom during VMware’s reverse due diligence process and are referred to as the “VMware-
approved Broadcom financial projections” and, together with the VMware management financial projections, the
“financial projections.” The financial metrics set forth in the section titled “-VMware-Approved Broadcom Financial
Projections” were arithmetically calculated by J.P. Morgan solely using information provided in the VMware-
approved Broadcom financial projections and were approved by VMware for use by J.P. Morgan for purposes of
performing its financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the VMware board of directors (as more
fully described in the section titled “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan”). However, the VMware-approved Broadcom financial
projections were not utilized by Goldman Sachs for purposes of performing its financial analyses in connection with
rendering its opinion to the VMware board of directors
62
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(as more fully described in the section titled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs”). A summary of these financial projections
is included below to give VMware stockholders access to certain information that was considered by the VMware
board of directors for purposes of evaluating the transactions. These projections are not, and should not be viewed
as, public guidance or even targets.
The financial projections, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables and
assumptions, including about future performance, that are inherently uncertain and many of which are beyond
VMware’s and Broadcom’s control. The financial projections reflect numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments
made by VMware management, based on information available at the time the financial projections were developed,
with respect to industry performance and competition, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial
conditions, other future events and matters specific to VMware’s and Broadcom’s business, all of which are difficult
to predict and many of which are beyond VMware’s and Broadcom’s control. There can be no assurances that the
financial projections accurately reflect future trends or accurately estimate VMware’s or Broadcom’s future financial
and operating performance. The financial projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that
are subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the financial projections not to be
achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to VMware’s and Broadcom’s business
(including the ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods), industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other factors described in or referenced under
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and those risks and uncertainties detailed in
VMware’s and Broadcom’s public filings with the SEC. Further, the financial projections cover multiple years and by
their nature become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that the financial projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially from those shown. Modeling and
forecasting the future performance of a software company is a highly speculative endeavor. Since the financial
projections cover a long period of time, the financial projections by their nature are unlikely to anticipate each
circumstance that will have an effect on the commercial value of VMware’s and Broadcom’s products and services.
The principal assumptions reflected in the VMware management financial projections include (i) VMware continuing
to drive a progressive business model transition from a majority of software sales being comprised of perpetual
license software to a majority of software sales being comprised of software-as-a-service (referred to as SaaS) or
subscription offerings; (ii) bookings growth rates remaining at or ahead of projected market compound annual growth
rates (based on projections from April 2022) for a majority of product offerings, leading to (A) year-over-year growth
of subscription and SaaS revenue ranging from 26% to 37% in fiscal years 2023 through 2025 and (B) revenue growth
of 9% and 11% in fiscal years 2024 and 2025, respectively, fueled by subscription and SaaS revenue, which is
projected to account for 46% of the overall revenue mix in fiscal year 2025; (iii) expansion of operating margin to
30.0% in fiscal year 2025, representing a return to pre-SaaS transition operating margins as VMware’s subscription
and SaaS business model scales and operational investments driving transition or dual operating model (on-premises
software or SaaS) are reduced and a majority of offerings are subscription and SaaS; (iv) returning to double digit
operating cash flow growth starting fiscal year 2025 as collections related to SaaS transition normalize and operating
margin improves; and (v) expiration of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amendments to Code Section 174, which would
no longer permit an immediate deduction for research and development expenditures in the tax year in which such
costs are incurred, impacting both (A) the annual tax rate applicable to VMware, forecasted at 16% in fiscal year 2023
and increasing to 23% in fiscal years 2024-2027 and (B) cash tax payments commensurate with an expected increase in
tax rate which would impact operating cash flow starting in fiscal year 2023.
The principal assumptions reflected in the VMware-approved Broadcom financial projections include (i) use of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily
comply with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information or generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (referred to as GAAP).
The financial projections included in this document, including the financial projections set forth below in the sections
titled “-VMware Management Financial Projections” and “-VMware-Approved Broadcom Financial Projections,” are
the responsibility of VMware’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, VMware’s independent registered public
accounting firm, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to
the financial projections and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other
form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report on VMware’s consolidated financial
statements incorporated by reference from VMware’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January
28, 2022 relates to VMware’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the financial projections
and should not be read to do so.
The financial projections are not being included in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to influence any VMware
stockholder’s decision as to whether or not to approve the transactions or whether or not to seek appraisal rights
with respect to shares of VMware common stock held by such stockholder. The summary of the financial projections
is being included in this proxy statement/prospectus solely because these financial projections were made available
to the VMware board of directors, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.
The financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were
prepared, including the announcement of the transactions and transaction-related expenses. The financial projections
also do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions to close and should not be viewed as
accurate or continuing in that context.
The inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication
that VMware, Broadcom, Goldman Sachs or J.P. Morgan or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or
representatives considered or consider the financial projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the
financial projections should not be relied on as such. None of VMware, Broadcom, Goldman Sachs or J.P. Morgan or
any of their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives can give any assurance that actual
results will not differ from these financial projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update or
otherwise revise or reconcile the financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date such financial
projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the
assumptions underlying the financial projections are shown to be in error or no longer appropriate. Neither VMware
nor Broadcom intends to make publicly available any update or other revision to the financial projections, except as
required by law. None of VMware, Broadcom, Goldman Sachs or J.P. Morgan or any of their respective affiliates,
advisors, officers, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation to any stockholder or other
investor regarding the ultimate performance of VMware or Broadcom compared to the information contained in the
financial projections or that projected results will be achieved.
VMware’s and Broadcom’s respective stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the financial
projections included in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The financial projections incorporate certain financial measures which are not GAAP measures. Such financial
measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in
accordance with GAAP. VMware’s calculations of these financial measures may differ from others in its industry and
are not necessarily comparable with information presented under similar captions used by other companies. Financial
measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the SEC’s definition of non-GAAP financial measures and
therefore are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which may otherwise
require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure to be presented.
Reconciliations of these financial measures were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs or J.P. Morgan for purposes of
performing their respective financial analyses in connection with rendering their respective opinions to the VMware
board of directors (as described in the sections titled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs” and “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan”) or
by the VMware board of directors. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the financial
projections is not provided.

Opinions of VMware’s Financial Advisors
Opinion of Goldman Sachs
Opinion of Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May 26,
2022, to the VMware board of directors that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and
65
TABLE OF CONTENTS
subject to the various limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the aggregate merger
consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated May 26, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion
for the information and assistance of the VMware board of directors in connection with its consideration of the
transactions. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of VMware common stock
should vote with respect to the transactions or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman
Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the merger agreement;
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of VMware for the five fiscal years ended
January 28, 2022, for Broadcom for the four fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and for Broadcom Limited,
Broadcom’s predecessor, for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2017;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of VMware and Broadcom;
•
certain other communications from VMware and Broadcom to their respective stockholders;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for VMware and Broadcom; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for VMware prepared by its management, as approved for
Goldman Sachs’ use by VMware (referred to in this section titled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs” as VMware
management financial projections and summarized in the section titled “-Certain Financial Projections
Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware’s Financial Advisors-VMware Management
Financial Projections”), certain financial analyses and forecasts for Broadcom stand-alone prepared by the
management of VMware, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by VMware, and certain operating synergies
projected by the management of VMware to result from the transactions.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of VMware and Broadcom regarding
their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the transactions and the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Broadcom and with members of the senior
management of VMware regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition
and future prospects of VMware; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of VMware common
stock and Broadcom common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for VMware and
Broadcom with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed
the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the technology, media and telecom industry; and
performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the VMware board of directors, relied
upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other
information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the VMware board of directors that
the VMware management financial projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of VMware. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet
assets and liabilities) of VMware or Broadcom or any of their respective subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other
consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the transactions would be obtained without any adverse
effect on VMware or Broadcom or on the expected benefits of the
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
transactions in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the transactions would be
consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or
condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of VMware to engage in the transactions
or the relative merits of the transactions as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to VMware;
nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters or the fairness of the proration and other
procedures and limitations contained in the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did
not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, VMware
or any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of
view to the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock, as of the date of the
written opinion, of the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger
agreement or the transactions or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger
agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the transactions, including the fairness of the transactions
to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or
other constituencies of VMware; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of VMware, or class of such persons, in connection with the
transactions, whether relative to the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of VMware
common stock (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Broadcom common stock or VMware
common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets
on VMware or Broadcom or the transactions, or as to the impact of the transactions on the solvency or viability of
VMware or Broadcom or the ability of VMware or Broadcom to pay their respective obligations when they come due.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions, as in effect on,
and the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility
for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the
date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and its opinion expressed were provided for the information
and assistance of the VMware board in connection with its consideration of the transactions and such opinion does
not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of VMware common stock should vote or make any
election with respect to the transactions or any other matter. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness
committee of Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Material Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to the VMware board of
directors in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not
purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of
analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the
summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together
with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is
based on market data as it existed on or before May 25, 2022, the last trading day before the public announcement of
the transactions and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Implied Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below using
implied values of the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares
of VMware common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. For purposes of this analysis, Goldman Sachs
calculated implied values for the merger consideration, reflecting an implied value per share of VMware common
stock assuming a cash election and no proration, an implied value per share of VMware common stock assuming a
stock election and no proration and a blended value per share of VMware common stock (assuming proration of 50%
cash and 50% equity based on the treatment of VMware common stock, stock options, restricted stock units and
performance stock units pursuant to the merger agreement), each calculated as of May 20, 2022 (the last trading day
prior to market speculation regarding the transactions) (referred to in this section titled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs”
as the Undisturbed Date), and as of May 24, 2022, the last trading

day prior to the May 25th meeting of the VMware board of directors at which Goldman Sachs reviewed with the
VMware board of directors its financial analyses of the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to the holders of
shares of VMware common stock (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement.
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the implied values of the merger consideration per share
of VMware common stock relative to:
•
$95.71, the closing price for VMware common stock on the Undisturbed Date; and
•
$115.94, the closing price for VMware common stock on May 24, 2022.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the VMware management financial projections, Goldman Sachs
performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on VMware to derive a range of illustrative present values per
share of VMware common stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and discount rates
ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting estimates of VMware’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs
discounted to present value as of April 29, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for VMware, as
arithmetically calculated by Goldman Sachs solely using information provided in the VMware management financial
projections and approved by VMware’s management for use by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion and
financial analyses and referred to as “Unlevered Free Cash Flow (Less Stock-Based Compensation Expenses)” in the
section titled “The Merger-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware’s
Financial Advisors,” for the nine months ended January 28, 2023 and fiscal years 2024 through 2027 and (ii) a range
of illustrative terminal values for VMware, which were calculated by applying illustrative perpetuity growth rates
ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by VMware, as
approved by VMware management for use by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion and financial analyses.
Based on the foregoing, Goldman Sachs also calculated implied terminal value to next twelve months unlevered free
cash flow multiples ranging from 10.9x to 15.8x. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (referred to in this section titled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs” as “CAPM”), which
requires certain company-specific inputs, including VMware’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-
term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for
VMware, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of illustrative
perpetuity growth rates for VMware was estimated by Goldman Sachs using its professional judgment and
experience, taking into account, among other things, the VMware management financial projections and market
expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for VMware by adding the ranges of present values it
derived as described above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived
for VMware the amount of VMware’s total debt and added the amount of VMware’s cash and cash equivalents and
strategic investments as of April 29, 2022, as provided by VMware management and approved for Goldman Sachs’
use by VMware management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for VMware. Goldman Sachs then divided
the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of VMware as of
the Undisturbed Date, as provided by VMware management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by VMware
management, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the
nearest $0.10, of $100.80 to $148.90.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the
implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of VMware common stock, which is designed to provide
an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of VMware’s equity as a
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
function of VMware’s estimated future unlevered free cash flow and enterprise value to one-year forward unlevered
free cash flow (referred in this section titled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs” as forward EV/UFCF) multiples. For this
analysis, Goldman Sachs used the VMware management financial projections for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2026.
Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied future enterprise value of VMware as of January 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025,
by applying a range of forward EV/UFCF multiples of 12.0x to 16.0x to the estimates of unlevered free cash flow for
VMware, as reflected in the VMware management financial projections and referred to as Unlevered Free Cash Flow
in the section titled “-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware’s
Financial Advisors,” for each of the fiscal years 2024, 2025 and 2026. These illustrative multiples were derived by
Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account, among other things, current
and historical average forward EV/UFCF multiples for VMware and certain selected diversified software companies
described in the section titled “-Selected Public Company Comparables.”
Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of VMware’s total debt and added the amount of VMware’s cash and
cash equivalents and strategic investments as of January 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, each as provided by management
of VMware and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by VMware management, to the range of implied enterprise values
to derive a range of illustrative equity values as of January 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided
these implied equity values by the projected number of fully diluted outstanding shares of VMware, as provided by
VMware management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by VMware management, as of January 31, 2023, 2024
and 2025, to derive a range of implied future equity values per share of VMware common stock. Goldman Sachs then
discounted these implied equity values per share to the Undisturbed Date, using an illustrative discount rate of 8.5%,
reflecting an estimate of VMware’s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the
CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for VMware, as well as certain financial
metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values
per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.10, of $92.30 to $139.90.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to
the following selected transactions in the technology, media and telecom industry. For each of the selected
transactions, where information was publicly available, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied
enterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of
the target company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the next twelve month period
(referred to in this section titled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs” as EV/NTM EBITDA) at or prior to the announcement
of the applicable transaction based on FactSet and Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System estimates.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
While none of the selected transactions or companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly
comparable to the transactions or VMware, the transactions included as selected transactions were chosen because
the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations, results, market size
and product profiles that, for the purpose of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain of those of VMware.
The foregoing analysis indicated a 25th percentile EV/NTM EBITDA multiple of 11.1x and 75th percentile EV/NTM
EBITDA multiple of 14.3x. Using this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a
range of illustrative EV/EBITDA multiples of 11.1x to 14.3x to an estimate of VMware’s next twelve months’ EBITDA,
as reflected in the VMware management financial projections and referred to as “Adjusted EBITDA” in the section
titled “-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware’s Financial Advisors,”
to derive a range of implied enterprise values for VMware. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of implied
enterprise values the amount of VMware’s total debt and added the amount of VMware’s cash and cash equivalents
and strategic investments as of April 29, 2022, as provided by VMware management and approved for Goldman
Sachs’ use by VMware management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for VMware. Goldman Sachs
divided the range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of VMware as of the
Undisturbed Date, as provided by management of VMware and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by management of
VMware, to derive a range of implied values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.10, of
$99.10 to $132.90.
Premia Paid Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition
premia for 45 transactions announced from January 1, 2013 through the Undisturbed Date, involving a public
technology, media, or telecommunication company based in the United States as the target where the disclosed
enterprise value for the transaction was greater than $10 billion. For the entire period, Goldman Sachs calculated the
median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target’s last
undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transactions. This analysis indicated a median premium
of 30%, a 25th percentile premium of 22% and a 75th percentile premium of 45% across the period. Using this analysis
and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a range of illustrative premia of 22% to 45% to
the undisturbed closing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 as of the Undisturbed Date and
calculated a range of implied values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.10, of $116.80 to
$138.80.
Selected Public Company Comparables. Using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs reviewed and
compared forward EV/UFCF multiples for VMware and the following publicly traded companies in the diversified
software industry, which are collectively referred to as the “selected companies”:
•
Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.
•
Cisco Systems, Inc.
•
F5, Inc.
•
International Business Machines Corporation
•
Microsoft Corporation
•
Oracle Corporation
•
SAP SE
Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to VMware, the companies included were chosen
because they are publicly traded companies in the diversified software industry with certain operations that for
purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of VMware.

General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the
analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In
arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.
No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to VMware or
Broadcom or the transactions.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the VMware board
of directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of its opinion, of the aggregate merger
consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are
not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors
or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of VMware, Broadcom, Goldman Sachs
or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasts.
The aggregate merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between VMware and
Broadcom and was approved by the VMware board of directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to VMware during
these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount or form of consideration to
VMware or the VMware board of directors or that any specific amount or form of consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the transactions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the VMware board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the VMware board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The
foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in
connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman

have co-invested with MSD Capital and Silver Lake and their respective affiliates from time to time and may have
invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Silver Lake from time to time and may do so in the future.
The VMware board of directors selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transactions.
Pursuant to a letter agreement dated May 25, 2022, VMware engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the transactions. The engagement letter between VMware and Goldman Sachs provides for a
transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately
$45 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the transactions. In addition, VMware has agreed to
reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify
Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities
laws.
Opinion of J.P. Morgan
Pursuant to an engagement letter, VMware retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the
transactions.
At the meeting of the VMware board of directors on May 26, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the
VMware board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various limitations, qualifications
and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of VMware common
stock in the transactions was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan subsequently confirmed
its oral opinion by delivering its written opinion, dated May 26, 2022, to the VMware board of directors, that, as of
such date, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of VMware common stock in the transactions was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated May 26, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex E to this proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in
this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. VMware’s
stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the VMware
board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the
transactions, was directed only to the merger consideration to be paid in the transactions and did not address any
other aspect of the transactions. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to the
holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of VMware or as to the underlying decision
by VMware to engage in the transactions. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was
73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of VMware as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the transactions or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed a draft dated May 26, 2022 of the merger agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning VMware and Broadcom
and the industries in which they operate;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the transactions with the publicly available financial terms of
certain transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of VMware and Broadcom with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and
historical market prices of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock and certain publicly traded
securities of such other companies;
•
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of VMware relating
to VMware and the business of Broadcom, as well as the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings
and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the transactions (referred to in this section
titled “- Opinion of J.P. Morgan” as the synergies); and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan
deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of VMware and Broadcom with
respect to certain aspects of the transactions, and the past and current business operations of VMware and
Broadcom, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of VMware and Broadcom, the effects of the
transactions on the financial condition and future prospects of VMware and Broadcom and certain other matters J.P.
Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by VMware and Broadcom or otherwise
reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or
completeness and, pursuant to J.P. Morgan’s engagement letter with VMware, J.P. Morgan did not assume any
obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with
any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of VMware or
Broadcom under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial
analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, including the synergies, J.P. Morgan assumed
that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of VMware and
Broadcom to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts
(including the synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the
transactions will qualify as tax-free reorganizations for United States federal income tax purposes, and will be
consummated as described in the merger agreement (and that any implementation of the alternative transaction
structure contemplated by the merger agreement would not have any effect on J.P. Morgan’s analysis), and that the
definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan.
J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by VMware, Broadcom, Holdco, Merger Sub
1 and Broadcom Merger Subs in the merger agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in
all respects material to its analysis. J.P Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments
made by advisors to VMware with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the transactions would be obtained
without any adverse effect on VMware or Broadcom or on the contemplated benefits of the transactions.
The VMware management financial projections and the VMware approved Broadcom financial projections furnished
to J.P. Morgan were prepared by VMware’s management. VMware does not publicly disclose internal
74
TABLE OF CONTENTS
management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the
transactions, and such financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These financial
projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the
control of VMware’s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive
conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in
such financial projections. For more information regarding the use of financial projections and other forward-looking
statements, please refer to the section titled “-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of
Directors and VMware’s Financial Advisors.”
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that
subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to
update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of VMware common stock in the transactions, and J.P. Morgan
expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the transactions to the
holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of VMware or as to the underlying decision
by VMware to engage in the transactions. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount
or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the transactions, or any class
of such persons relative to the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of VMware common stock in the
transactions or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the
price at which VMware common stock or Broadcom common stock would trade at any future time.
As of the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan was not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of
interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of VMware or any other alternative
transaction.
The terms of the merger agreement were determined through arm’s length negotiations between VMware and
Broadcom, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the VMware board of directors. J.P.
Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the VMware board of
directors in its evaluation of the transactions and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the VMware
board of directors or management with respect to the transactions or the merger consideration.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation
methodology in rendering its opinion to the VMware board of directors on May 26, 2022 and contained in the
presentation delivered to the VMware board of directors on such date in connection with the rendering of such
opinion and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of
the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended
to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be
read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
VMware Analysis
Public Trading Multiples Analysis
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of VMware with similar data for
selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to the
business of VMware. These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded
companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analyses, may be considered
sufficiently similar to those of VMware. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical to VMware
and certain of these companies have financial and operating characteristics that are materially different from those of
VMware. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial
and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies
differently from how they would affect VMware. With respect to the selected companies, J.P. Morgan calculated the
ratio of firm value to unlevered free cash flow for the calendar year 2023
75
TABLE OF CONTENTS
for each company based on publicly available financial information and Wall Street estimates per FactSet Research
Systems as of May 24, 2022 (referred to as FV / uFCF CY23E). For VMware, the companies selected by J.P. Morgan
were:
Selected Company
Cisco Systems, Inc.
International Business Machines Corporation
Microsoft Corporation
Oracle Corporation
SAP SE
VMware, Inc.(1)
(1)
Based on unaffected closing share price as of the Undisturbed Date.
Based on the results of the above analysis and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan
selected a FV / uFCF CY23E multiple reference range for VMware of 10.5x - 16.5x. J.P. Morgan then applied that range
to VMware’s estimated unlevered free cash flow for fiscal year 2024 (used as a proxy for calendar year 2023 per
VMware management) included in the unaudited prospective financial information provided by VMware management
and described in the section titled “-Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and
VMware’s Financial Advisors”, adjusted for the net debt balance of VMware. This analysis indicated a range of
implied equity values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $78.75 to $134.00, which
was compared to the unaffected closing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on May 20, 2022 (the last
trading day prior to public rumors of a potential sale of VMware to Broadcom) (referred to in this section titled “-
Opinion of J.P. Morgan” as the Undisturbed Date) and the blended offer price per share of $139.69 (referred to in this
section titled “- Opinion of J.P. Morgan” as the Blended Offer Price), calculated based on 50:50 proration of the per
share cash consideration of $142.50 and the per share stock consideration of 0.25200 Broadcom shares for each share
of VMware common stock (based on the unaffected closing price per share of Broadcom common stock of $543.19 on
the Undisturbed Date).
Selected Transaction Multiples Analysis
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving companies engaged in
businesses that J.P. Morgan judged to be reasonably analogous to the business of VMware or aspects thereof. None
of the selected transactions reviewed were identical to the transactions. Certain of these transactions may have
characteristics that are materially different from those of the transactions. However, the selected transactions were
chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analyses, may be considered
similar to the transactions. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect
the transactions differently than they would affect the transactions. For each of the selected transactions, J.P.
Morgan calculated the ratio of the target company’s firm value to the Wall Street estimates of EBITDA for the twelve
month period following the announcement of the applicable transaction (referred to as FV / NTM EBITDA).
Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the following transactions:

Based on the results of these analyses and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan
selected a FV / NTM EBITDA multiple reference range of 11.0x to 14.5x. J.P. Morgan then applied that reference range
to VMware management’s estimated NTM EBITDA, adjusted for the net debt balance of VMware. This analysis
indicated a range of implied equity values per share of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of
$98.00 to $135.00, which was compared to the unaffected closing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71
as of the Undisturbed Date and the Blended Offer Price.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value
per share for VMware common stock on a standalone basis. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of
evaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by an asset and taking into
consideration the time value of money with respect to such future cash flows by calculating their present value.
Unlevered free cash flow refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated by an asset without including in
such calculation any debt servicing costs. The current value of the future cash flows generated by an asset obtained
by discounting those future cash flows back to the present using an appropriate discount rate is referred to as the
present value in this section titled “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan.” The present value of all future cash flows generated by
an asset for periods beyond the projections period is referred to as the terminal value in this section titled “-Opinion
of J.P. Morgan.”
J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that VMware is expected to generate during the remainder of
fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2027 based upon the VMware management financial projections. Based on
VMware management’s estimates of a 2.5% terminal value growth rate in the industry in which VMware operates, J.P.
Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for VMware by applying terminal growth rates ranging from 2.0%
to 3.0% to the unlevered free cash flows of VMware at the end of fiscal year 2027. The unlevered free cash flows and
the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values using a range of discount rates from 7.5% to
8.5%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of VMware.
The present value of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then adjusted for the net
debt balance of VMware and divided by VMware’s fully diluted shares outstanding (calculated using the treasury
stock method). Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan arrived at a range of implied equity values per share
of VMware common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $109.00 to $159.25, which was compared to the unaffected
closing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on the Undisturbed Date and the Blended Offer Price.

Broadcom Analysis
Public Trading Multiples Analysis
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of Broadcom with similar data for
selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to the
business of Broadcom. These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded
companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analyses, may be considered
sufficiently similar to those of Broadcom. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical to Broadcom
and certain of these companies have financial and operating characteristics that are materially different from those of
Broadcom. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected
companies differently from how they would affect Broadcom. With respect to the selected companies, J.P. Morgan
calculated the ratio of closing share price to earnings per share for the calendar year 2023 for each company based on
publicly available financial information and Wall Street estimates per FactSet Research Systems as of May 24, 2022,
which is referred to as P/E CY23E. For Broadcom, the companies selected by J.P. Morgan were:

Based on unaffected closing share price as of the Undisturbed Date.
Based on the results of the above analysis and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan
selected a P/E CY23E multiple reference range for Broadcom of 13.0x - 16.0x. J.P. Morgan then applied that range to
Broadcom’s estimated earnings per share for calendar year 2023, as provided by VMware management. This analysis
indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Broadcom common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of
$519.50 to $639.25, which was compared to the unaffected closing price per share of Broadcom common stock of
$543.19 on the Undisturbed Date.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value
per share for Broadcom common stock on a standalone basis.
J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Broadcom is expected to generate during the remainder of
fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2026 based upon the VMware approved Broadcom financial projections. Based on
VMware management’s estimates of a 2.5% terminal value growth rate in the industry in which Broadcom operates,
J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Broadcom by applying terminal growth rates ranging from
2.0% to 3.0% to the unlevered free cash flows of Broadcom at the end of fiscal year 2026. The unlevered free cash
flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values using a range of discount rates from
8.0% to 9.0%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of
Broadcom. The present value of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then adjusted for
the net debt balance of Broadcom and divided by Broadcom’s fully diluted shares outstanding (calculated using the
treasury stock method). Based on the results of

common stock of $543.19 on the Undisturbed Date (the last trading day prior to public rumors of a potential sale of
VMware to Broadcom).

J.P. Morgan compared the implied equity values per share for VMware with those of Broadcom with respect to the
analyses referenced in the table below. For each comparison, J.P. Morgan compared the highest equity value per
share for VMware to the lowest equity value per share for Broadcom to derive the highest exchange ratio implied by
each pair of estimates. J.P. Morgan also compared the lowest equity value per share for VMware to the highest equity
value per share for Broadcom to derive the lowest exchange ratio implied by each pair of estimates. The results of this
analysis are indicated in the following table:

The implied exchange ratio reference ranges for VMware and Broadcom were compared to the equivalent 100% stock
election exchange ratio in the transactions of 0.25200 shares of Broadcom common stock per share of VMware
common stock and the unaffected exchange ratio of 0.1762 shares of Broadcom common stock for each share of
VMware common stock (based on the trading prices of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock on the
Undisturbed Date, the last trading day prior to public rumors of a potential sale of VMware to Broadcom).
Intrinsic Value of Merger Consideration - DCF Based
J.P. Morgan conducted a value creation analysis that compared the implied equity value of VMware common stock
derived from J.P. Morgan’s discounted cash flow valuation of VMware on a standalone basis to the value of the cash
consideration plus VMware common stockholders’ pro forma ownership of the implied equity value of Broadcom.
The pro forma implied equity value of Broadcom was calculated as the sum of: (i) the standalone implied equity value
of VMware using the midpoint value determined in J.P. Morgan’s discounted cash flow analysis described in the
section titled “-VMware Analysis-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” plus (ii) the standalone implied equity value of
Broadcom using the midpoint value determined in J.P. Morgan’s discounted cash flow analysis described in the
section titled “-Broadcom Analysis-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” plus (iii) the present value of VMware
management’s estimate of the net synergies, calculated on an after-tax basis and less transaction expenses and using
a discount rate of 8.0% and a terminal value growth rate of 2.5%. J.P. Morgan then determined the implied pro forma
equity value of Broadcom attributable to VMware common stockholders based on the equity ownership percentage
of Broadcom of approximately 12% (on a fully diluted basis) plus the cash consideration to be paid to VMware
common stockholders. This analysis indicated an implied equity value per share to holders of VMware common
stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $155.00, and yielded value accretion to holders of VMware common stock of
$11.3 billion. There can be no assurance, however, that the estimated synergies or estimated costs to achieve such
synergies will not be substantially greater or less than VMware management’s estimates.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary
and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these
analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes
and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of VMware or Broadcom. The
order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P.
Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular
79
TABLE OF CONTENTS
weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis
or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan
considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.
Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or
otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected
companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to VMware or Broadcom, and none of the
selected transactions reviewed was identical to the transactions. However, the companies selected were chosen
because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s
analysis, may be considered similar to those of VMware and Broadcom, as applicable. The transactions selected were
similarly chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be
considered similar to the transactions. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that
could affect the companies compared to VMware and Broadcom and the transactions selected compared to the
transactions.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise VMware with respect to the
transactions on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection
with such matters and its familiarity with VMware and the industries in which it operates.
For services rendered in connection with the transactions, VMware has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a fee estimated to
be approximately $45 million based on the information available as of the date of announcement of the transactions,
which is payable to J.P. Morgan upon the closing of the transactions, $5.0 million of which was earned by J.P. Morgan
upon delivery of its opinion. In addition, VMware has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in
connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against
certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement.
During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial
or investment banking relationships with VMware, Broadcom, Silver Lake, a significant stockholder of VMware, and
portfolio companies of Silver Lake for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation.
Such services during such period for Broadcom have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on its
revolving credit facility in January 2021 and joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities in January 2021.
Such services during such period for VMware have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on a
revolving credit facility in November 2021, joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities in July 2021, and
financial advisor to VMware on the VMware spin-off in November 2021. Such services during such two-year period
for Silver Lake and Silver Lake portfolio companies have included extending loans and providing debt syndication,
equity underwriting, debt underwriting, private bank lending and capital raising and/or financial advisory services,
for which J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have received customary compensation, and, in the case of such services
provided to Silver Lake, in amounts not material to J.P. Morgan. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate
is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of VMware and Silver Lake portfolio companies, for
which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. During the two year period preceding delivery
of its opinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from VMware were approximately $45 million, from
Broadcom were approximately $13 million, and from Silver Lake and its portfolio companies were approximately $128
million. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and
equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of VMware or
Broadcom for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long
or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.
Interests of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions
When considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors with respect to the transactions, you
should be aware that VMware’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the transactions that
80
TABLE OF CONTENTS
are different from, or in addition to, those of VMware stockholders more generally. The VMware board of directors
was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the transactions and considered them in
deciding to recommend that VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.
As described below, the interests of VMware non-employee directors and executive officers include the following:
•
accelerated vesting of restricted stock units held by non-employee directors and conversion of time-based
restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units held by executive officers into
Broadcom restricted stock units and the “double trigger” accelerated vesting of such converted awards;
•
a seat on Broadcom’s board of directors for one VMware director, to be mutually agreed by VMware and
Broadcom, following the closing of the transactions;
•
potential severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment upon or
following the closing of the transactions; and
•
the right to indemnification and liability insurance coverage that will survive the closing of the
transactions.
VMware’s executive officers (all of whom are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below) are the
following: Raghu Raghuram, Zane Rowe, Sumit Dhawan, Jean-Pierre Brulard and Amy Fliegelman Olli. Patrick
Gelsinger and Sanjay Poonen are also deemed to be named executive officers, but because they separated from
employment with VMware on February 12, 2021 and August 6, 2021, respectively, they will not receive any benefit
that is payable or that may become payable that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the transactions other than the
merger consideration in respect of any shares of VMware common stock that they own, and they are not included in
the disclosure below.
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in
this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
A per share price of VMware common stock of $130.09, which is the average closing price of VMware
common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the first five business days following the first public
announcement of the transactions on May 26, 2022;
•
The effective time of the second merger is September 30, 2022; and
•
The employment of each VMware executive officer was terminated by VMware without cause or by the
executive officer for good reason, in either case, immediately following the effective time of the second
merger.
Treatment of VMware Equity Awards
VMware’s non-employee directors and executive officers hold certain time-based VMware restricted stock unit
awards and performance-based VMware restricted stock unit awards. No executive officers or non-employee
directors hold any outstanding stock options.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the second merger,
outstanding VMware restricted stock unit awards and performance-based VMware restricted stock unit awards will
be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes:
•
each outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee director will become vested
and will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each share of VMware
common stock subject to such award, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the
stock consideration;
•
each outstanding time-based VMware restricted stock unit award that is not held by a non-employee
director will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange
ratio calculated as (i) the sum of (1) 50% of the stock consideration and (2) 50% of the cash consideration
divided by (ii) the Broadcom trading price; and
81
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
each outstanding performance-based VMware restricted stock unit award will be converted into a
Broadcom restricted stock unit award using the same formula described in the above bullet, provided that
(i) for each such award granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit plan, performance
goals will be deemed achieved (1) at the actual level with respect to performance periods completed prior to
the closing of the transactions, or (2) at target level with respect to performance periods not completed
prior to the closing of the transactions; and (ii) for each such award that was granted under the VMware
TSR performance stock unit plan, performance will be measured at the closing of the transactions based on
the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals based on the value of merger
consideration (with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the
Broadcom trading price).
Pursuant to the VMware, Inc. Change in Control Retention Plan (referred to as the CIC Plan) as described below, if a
VMware executive officer’s employment is terminated by VMware without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s
resignation for “good reason”, in each case, within 12 months following a change in control of VMware, all such
equity awards then held by such executive officer would fully vest upon such termination of employment.
These “double trigger” vesting provisions applicable to VMware equity awards held by executive officers will
continue to apply to such awards after such awards are converted to Broadcom restricted stock unit awards at the
effective time of the second merger.
See the section titled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Transactions” below for the estimated value of each VMware named executive officer’s
unvested VMware equity awards. Based on the assumptions described above under “-Certain Assumptions,” the
estimated aggregate value of the unvested VMware equity awards held by non-employee directors is $2,071,683.
Change in Control Retention Plan
Each VMware executive officer is eligible to receive change in control benefits pursuant to the CIC Plan upon an
involuntary termination without cause or a resignation for good reason, in each case, within 12 months following a
change in control of VMware (each such term as defined in the CIC Plan). The transactions constitute a change in
control for purposes of the CIC Plan.
Upon a qualifying termination under the CIC Plan, subject to execution of a release of claims in favor of VMware,
each executive officer is eligible to receive:
•
a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times (or 2.0 times for Mr. Raghuram) the sum of the executive officer’s
highest annual base salary and highest target annual bonus, in each case measured during the protected
period (as defined in the CIC Plan);
•
a lump sum payment equal to the value of 18 months (or 24 months for Mr. Raghuram) of health insurance
premiums, which are equal to 150% of the monthly cost required to obtain continuation coverage for the
executive officer and their covered dependents; and
•
full accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards.
The CIC Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups. In the event the executive officer would be subject to an excise
tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the benefits to the executive officer will be reduced to the extent that such
benefits do not trigger the excise tax unless the executive officer would retain greater value (on an after-tax basis) by
receiving all benefits and paying applicable excise, income and payroll taxes.
See the section titled “-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Transactions” below for an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits that each of
VMware’s named executive officers would receive under the CIC Plan upon a qualifying termination of employment
immediately following the effective time of the second merger.
Board Seat on the Broadcom Board of Directors
Pursuant to the merger agreement, one member of the VMware board of directors, to be mutually agreed by VMware
and Broadcom, will be added to Broadcom’s board of directors.
82
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Potential Employment Arrangements with Broadcom
Any of VMware’s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide
services to Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs may, prior to, on, or following the closing of the transactions, enter
into new individualized compensation arrangements with Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs and may participate in
cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs. As of the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus, no new individualized compensation arrangements between VMware’s executive
officers and Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs have been established.
Indemnification and Insurance
Under the merger agreement, for a period of six years after the effective time of the second merger, the entity into
which VMware converted in connection with its conversion into a limited liability company (referred to as the
VMware Converted LLC) must, and Broadcom must cause VMware Converted LLC to, indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the organizational documents of VMware or its subsidiaries, or
any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom
prior to the date of the merger agreement, each current and former director and officer of VMware and its subsidiaries
against any costs and expenses in connection with any actual or threatened claims in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the effective time of the second merger, in connection with such person serving as an
officer, director, employee or agent of another corporation or of a limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity if such service was at the request of VMware.
In addition, for a period of six years following the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom is required to
maintain in effect the provisions in the organizational documents of VMware and any indemnification agreements in
existence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom (except to the extent such
agreement provides for an earlier termination) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors
and employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence as of the date of the merger agreement.
At or prior to the effective time of the second merger, VMware is required to purchase a directors’ and officers’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance “tail” insurance policy for a period of six years after the effective
time of the second merger with respect to matters arising at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, and
officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance prior to the date of the merger agreement.
For a more detailed description of the provisions of the merger agreement relating to director and officer
indemnification and liability insurance, please see the section titled “The Merger Agreement-Directors’ and Officers’
Indemnification and Insurance.”
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Transactions
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which
requires disclosure of information about the compensation that is payable or that may become payable to each named
executive officer of VMware that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the transactions. For additional details
regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption “-Interests
of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” above.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the
table. As a result, the amount, if any, that a named executive officer actually receives in the transactions may
materially differ from the amounts set forth in the table. For purposes of calculating the amounts set forth in the table,
the following assumptions were used:
•
A per share price of VMware common stock of $130.09, which is the average closing price of VMware
common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the first five business days following the first public
announcement of the transactions on May 26, 2022;
83

•
The effective time of the second merger is September 30, 2022; and
•
The employment of each named executive officer was terminated by VMware without cause or by the
named executive officer for good reason, in either case, on or immediately following the effective time of the
second merger.

Consists of (i) a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times (or 2.0 times for Mr. Raghuram) the sum of the named executive officer’s
highest annual base salary and highest target annual bonus, in each case measured during the protected period (as defined in the
CIC Plan); and (ii) a lump sum payment equal to the value of 18 months (or 24 months for Mr. Raghuram) of health insurance

Includes accelerated vesting of the VMware restricted stock unit awards (which will be converted to Broadcom restricted stock
units upon the effective time of the second merger) upon a qualifying termination of employment following the closing of the
transactions pursuant to the CIC Plan; this accelerated vesting is a “double trigger” benefit and is triggered only upon a qualifying
termination of employment following a change in control of VMware (see the section titled “Interests of VMware’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Transactions-Treatment of VMware Equity Awards”). The estimated value of such awards are
shown in the following table (in the case of any such award that was granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit
plan, this estimated value assumes that the applicable performance goals are achieved at actual performance with respect to
performance periods completed prior to September 30, 2022 and at target with respect to performance periods that are not
completed prior to September 30, 2022 and in the case of any such award that was granted under the VMware TSR performance
stock unit plan, this estimated value represents the estimated actual payout level for such award based on the value of the merger
consideration, which is equal to $0).

Treatment of Indebtedness
For a description of Broadcom’s and VMware’s existing indebtedness, see Broadcom’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-
Q for the quarter ended May 1, 2022, filed on June 9, 2022 and VMware’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended April 29, 2022, filed on June 3, 2022, respectively, each of which is incorporated by reference herein.
For more details on the treatment of VMware’s existing indebtedness under the merger agreement, see the section
titled “The Merger Agreement-Actions with Respect to VMware Debt.”
This proxy statement/prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any debt
securities of Broadcom or VMware. It does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus equivalent document for any
such securities. No offering of any debt securities of Broadcom shall be made except by means of a prospectus
meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Financing of the Transactions
The transactions are not conditioned upon any financing arrangements or contingencies. Broadcom anticipates that
the funds needed to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be derived from a
combination of cash on hand and third party debt financing.
In connection with its entry into the merger agreement, Broadcom entered into a debt commitment letter on May 26,
2022 with certain financial institutions, which was amended, restated and superseded in its entirety by an amended
and restated commitment letter entered into by Broadcom on June 22, 2022 (such amended and restated commitment
letter, referred to as the debt commitment letter) with certain financial institutions pursuant to which such financial
institutions committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the debt commitment letter, a senior
unsecured bridge facility in aggregate principal amount of approximately $32 billion. The availability of the bridge
facility is conditioned on the consummation of the transactions in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement
(subject to certain customary exceptions and qualifications) and certain other customary conditions. Broadcom
expects to replace the commitments in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the transactions
with the proceeds of the issuance of one or more series of senior unsecured debt securities and/or other incurrences
of indebtedness (or commitments in respect thereof).
Accounting Treatment of the Transactions
The transactions will be accounted for as a business combination, with Broadcom using the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations, and, accordingly, will
generally result in the recognition of VMware assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. However, as of the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets
acquired (including intangible assets, such as completed technology, customer relationships and customer lists, and
trademarks and trade names) and liabilities assumed have been performed based on publicly available benchmarking
information as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market participant assumptions, as there are
limitations to the type of information that can be exchanged between Broadcom and VMware at this time. Until the
transactions are complete, Broadcom will not have complete access to all the relevant information. Differences
between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and there can be no assurances
that the final valuations will not result in material changes to this preliminary purchase price allocation. The excess of
the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information will be allocated to goodwill. A final determination of these fair values will reflect
appraisals prepared by independent third-parties and will be based on the actual tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities that exist as of the acquisition date. The actual allocation of the consideration transferred may differ from
the allocation assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and may result in
adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following general discussion addresses the material U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. holders (as
defined below) of VMware common stock that exchange their VMware common stock for the merger consideration in
the transactions. The discussion is based on the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative
rulings, published positions of the IRS and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to
change and to differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect), and any such change or interpretation could
affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion applies only to
U.S. holders that hold their VMware common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation that
may be relevant to a particular holder in light of his, her or its individual circumstances or to holders subject to
special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including:
•
banks or other financial institutions,
•
mutual funds,
•
tax exempt organizations,
•
governmental agencies or instrumentalities,
85
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
insurance companies,
•
dealers in securities or non-U.S. currency,
•
traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting,
•
entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities (including S corporations)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and investors in such partnerships or other pass-through entities
(including S corporations),
•
holders that are not U.S. holders,
•
certain expatriates,
•
holders that exercise appraisal rights,
•
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts,
•
broker-dealers,
•
holders liable for the alternative minimum tax,
•
holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar,
•
holders who received their VMware common stock through the exercise of employee stock options,
through a tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation,
•
holders that hold (or that held, directly or constructively, at any time during the five-year period ending on
the date of the disposition of such holder’s VMware common stock pursuant to the transactions) 5% or
more of VMware common stock (by vote or value),
•
holders required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being
recognized on an “applicable financial statement,” and
•
holders who hold VMware common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion
transaction or other integrated investment.
In addition, this discussion does not address any state, local or foreign tax considerations of the transactions, nor
does it address the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements
entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith) or any U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the
U.S. federal income tax.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of VMware common stock who is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
(i)
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
(ii)
a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
(iii) an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source; or
(iv) a trust that (A) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all substantial
decisions of which are subject to the control of one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (B) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership, including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
holds shares of VMware common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, such partners and
partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the particular tax considerations of the transactions to them.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each holder of VMware common stock should consult his, her or its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax
considerations of the transactions to such holder. Holders of VMware common stock that are not U.S. holders
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possibility that, in the event the applicable withholding agent
is unable to determine whether any cash consideration paid to them in the transactions should be treated as a
dividend for applicable U.S. federal income tax purposes, such withholding agent may withhold U.S. federal
withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on
the entire amount of any cash consideration payable to such non-U.S. holder in the transactions, and such non-
U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible desirability and timing of selling any shares
of VMware common stock or Broadcom common stock that they own.
In General
The obligation of VMware to complete the transactions is conditioned upon the delivery by Gibson Dunn, counsel to
VMware (or other nationally recognized tax counsel or Big 4 accounting firm as may be reasonably acceptable to
VMware) of the Tax Opinion. In addition, in connection with the filing of the registration statement of which this
document is a part, Gibson Dunn has delivered an opinion to VMware that the transactions will qualify for the
Intended Tax Treatment. Each of these tax opinions is or will be based on factual representations contained in
officer’s certificates provided by Broadcom and VMware, representations and covenants contained in the merger
agreement, and on certain customary factual assumptions, all of which must continue to be true and accurate as of
the consummation of the transactions. If any of the representations, covenants or assumptions upon which the tax
opinions are or will be based is inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the
transactions could be materially different from those discussed below. None of these opinions is binding on the IRS
or the courts, and neither Broadcom nor VMware intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal
income tax considerations of the transactions. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert,
or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of those set forth below.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transactions to U.S. Holders
VMware has received a legal opinion from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, U.S. tax counsel to VMware, to the effect
that, under currently applicable U.S. federal income tax law, (1) the first merger and the LLC conversion, taken
together, will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and (2) the second
merger and the third merger, taken together, will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)
(A) of the Code. Additionally, unless otherwise noted in the following discussion, and subject to the limitations,
qualifications, and assumptions described herein and set forth in the opinion filed as Exhibit 8.1 hereto, the
discussion in this subsection titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences-U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the transactions to U.S. Holders” constitutes the opinion of Gibson Dunn, counsel to VMware,
insofar as it contains legal conclusions with respect to matters of U.S. federal income tax law.
The U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions to a U.S. holder generally will depend on whether the
U.S. holder exchanges its VMware common stock for cash consideration, stock consideration or a combination of
cash consideration and stock consideration.
Exchange Solely for Cash
The exchange of shares of VMware common stock solely for cash generally will result in the recognition of gain or
loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in
the shares of VMware common stock surrendered. Such gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if
the U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to the VMware common stock surrendered is more than one year at the
effective time of the second merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals,
generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of VMware common stock at different times or different
prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each
block of VMware common stock. In certain circumstances, if a U.S. holder actually or constructively owns Broadcom
common stock after the transactions, the cash consideration received could be treated as having the effect of a
distribution of a dividend under the
87
TABLE OF CONTENTS
tests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, in which case such U.S. holder may have dividend income up to the amount
of the cash consideration received. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends primarily upon the
particular circumstances of a U.S. holder, including the application of certain constructive ownership rules, U.S.
holders that actually or constructively own Broadcom common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the
application of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.
U.S. holders electing to receive solely cash consideration in the transactions may be subject to proration (as
described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement-Effects of the Transactions-Proration and Allocation of
Merger Consideration.”), which may result in the receipt of a portion of the merger consideration in stock
consideration, in addition to cash consideration. See “-Exchange for Broadcom Common Stock and Cash” for a
general description of the U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. holders of the receipt of stock consideration
and cash consideration.
Exchange Solely for Broadcom Common Stock
If, pursuant to the transactions, a U.S. holder exchanges all of its shares of VMware common stock solely for shares
of Broadcom common stock, that U.S. holder generally will not recognize any gain or loss, except with respect to cash
received in lieu of a fractional share of Broadcom common stock (as discussed in “-Cash in Lieu of a Fractional
Share”). The aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares of Broadcom common stock received in the transactions
(including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described in “-Cash in Lieu of a Fractional Share”) will
be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of VMware common stock surrendered, and the holding
period of the shares of Broadcom common stock received in the transactions (including fractional shares deemed
received and redeemed as described in “-Cash in Lieu of a Fractional Share”) will include the holding period of the
shares of VMware common stock surrendered. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of VMware
common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder should consult his, her or its tax advisor as to
the determination of the tax bases and holding periods of the Broadcom common stock received in the transactions.
U.S. holders electing to receive solely stock consideration in the transactions may be subject to proration (as
described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement-Effects of the Transactions-Proration and Allocation of
Merger Consideration.”), which may result in the receipt of a portion of the merger consideration in cash
consideration, in addition to the stock consideration. See “-Exchange for Broadcom Common Stock and Cash” for a
general description of the U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. holders of the receipt of stock consideration
and cash consideration.
Exchange for Broadcom Common Stock and Cash
A U.S. holder who receives a combination of Broadcom common stock and cash (other than cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Broadcom common stock) pursuant to the transactions generally will recognize gain (but not loss)
in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the sum of the amount of the cash (other than cash in lieu of a fractional share
of Broadcom common stock) and the fair market value of the Broadcom common stock received, minus that U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of VMware common stock surrendered in exchange therefor and (2) the
amount of cash received.
If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of VMware common stock at different times or different prices, any
gain or loss may be determined separately for each block of shares and such U.S. holder’s basis and holding period
in its shares of Broadcom common stock may be determined with reference to each block of shares of VMware
common stock. Any such U.S. holder should consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the manner in which the
cash consideration and stock consideration should be allocated among different blocks of shares of VMware
common stock surrendered, including the ability to specifically identify shares of VMware common stock exchanged
for the cash consideration, and the determination of the tax bases and holding periods of the Broadcom common
stock received.
Any recognized gain will generally be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to the
shares of VMware common stock surrendered is more than one year at the effective time of the second merger. Long-
term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income
tax at preferential rates. In certain circumstances, if a U.S. holder actually or constructively owns Broadcom common
stock other than Broadcom common stock received pursuant to the transactions, the recognized gain could be
treated as having the effect of the distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in
88
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 302 of the Code, in which case such gain would be treated as dividend income. Because the possibility of
dividend treatment depends upon the particular circumstances of a U.S. holder, including the application of certain
constructive ownership rules, U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the
foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.
The aggregate tax basis of the Broadcom common stock received (including fractional shares deemed received and
redeemed as described in “-Cash in Lieu of a Fractional Share”) will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of
the shares of VMware common stock surrendered, reduced by the amount of cash consideration received by the U.S.
holder (excluding any cash in lieu of a fractional share) and increased by the amount of gain (regardless of whether
such gain is classified as capital gain or dividend income, as discussed above, but excluding any gain recognized
with respect to cash in lieu of a fractional share), if any, recognized by the U.S. holder on the exchange. The holding
period of the Broadcom common stock received in the transactions (including fractional shares deemed received and
redeemed as described below) will include the holding period of the shares of VMware common stock surrendered.
Cash in Lieu of a Fractional Share
U.S. holders who receive cash in lieu of a fractional share of Broadcom common stock will generally be treated as
having received such fractional share and then as having received such cash in redemption of the fractional share.
Gain or loss generally will be recognized based on the difference between the amount of cash in lieu of the fractional
share and the tax basis allocated to such fractional share. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or
loss if the holding period for such shares is more than one year at the effective time of the second merger. Long-term
capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax
at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to payments made in
connection with the transactions. Backup withholding will not apply, however, if the recipient provides proof of an
applicable exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with all applicable
certification requirements. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld may be allowed as a
refund or credit against such U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.
THIS SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTIONS
IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS OF VMWARE COMMON
STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSIDERATIONS TO
THEM OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE
APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.
Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Transactions
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters. The transactions are subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which
prevents VMware and Broadcom from completing the transactions until required information and materials are
furnished to the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the FTC and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires.
A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting
period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that
waiting period. The parties may also choose to voluntarily re-start the initial 30-calendar-day waiting period by
following certain prescribed procedures. After the expiration of the initial waiting period (or the re-started initial
waiting period), the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC may issue a Request for Additional Information and
Documentary Material (referred to as a second request). If a second request is issued, the parties may not complete
the transactions until they substantially comply with the second request and observe a second 30-calendar-day
waiting period, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier, or the parties commit not to close for some additional
period of time. VMware and Broadcom submitted the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act on
June 10, 2022. On July 11, 2022 VMware and Broadcom each received a request for additional information, often
referred to as a “second request,” from the FTC under the HSR Act.
89
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Foreign Regulatory Clearances. The completion of the transactions is subject to clearance under the antitrust laws
of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, and the parties will file or have filed merger notifications
pursuant to antitrust and competition laws with the appropriate regulators in the European Union and certain other
jurisdictions. The parties must observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearances
or consents pursuant to certain of these foreign laws before completing the transactions.
Other state or foreign antitrust, competition and foreign investment authorities may take action under the laws of
their jurisdictions, which could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the transactions. For more information
about regulatory approvals relating to the transactions, see the section titled “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to
the Transactions.”
Although the parties expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, the parties cannot
assure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the
granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the
completion of the transactions, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or
obligations or enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the
transactions not being satisfied.
Exchange of Shares; Elections as to Form of Consideration
At the effective time of the second merger, each issued and outstanding share of VMware common stock (other than
(i) cancelled shares, (ii) dissenting shares and (iii) excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the stockholder and subject to proration, $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.25200 of a share of
Broadcom common stock. A VMware stockholder may elect a different form of consideration for each share such
VMware stockholder owns. A VMware stockholder may elect to receive (i) solely the cash consideration, (ii) solely
the stock consideration or (iii) if a VMware stockholder owns more than one share, a combination of the cash
consideration for a selected number of shares and the stock consideration for the remaining number of shares. The
stockholder election will be subject to the election of other VMware stockholders and a proration mechanism, such
that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive the cash consideration, and the total
number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive the stock consideration, will, in each case, be equal to
50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the second merger. For example, if you elect to receive solely the cash consideration or solely the
stock consideration, and all other VMware stockholders make the same election, the consideration you receive will
vary to the maximum extent possible compared to your original election. In such instance, you would receive the cash
consideration in exchange for 50% of your shares of VMware common stock and the stock consideration in exchange
for 50% of your shares of VMware common stock. The following examples illustrate the proration mechanism in the
case of an oversubscription of either the cash consideration or the stock consideration (both if you elect solely the
oversubscribed form of merger consideration and if you elect a combination of the cash consideration and the stock
consideration). Note that for illustrative purposes, the following examples do not round shares to the nearest whole
number.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the cash consideration, and
80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect
to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make an election,
you will receive cash in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common
stock in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 55 shares
and the stock consideration for 45 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive
cash, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock and 5% of the
outstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 34.375 of your
shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 65.625 of your shares of
VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive solely the stock consideration, and
80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive Broadcom common stock, 15% of the
90
TABLE OF CONTENTS
outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the outstanding VMware shares do not make
an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 37.5 of your shares of VMware common stock and
Broadcom common stock in exchange for 62.5 of your shares of VMware common stock.
•
If you own 100 shares of VMware common stock and elect to receive the cash consideration for 45 shares
and the stock consideration for 55 shares, and 80% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive
Broadcom common stock, 15% of the outstanding VMware shares elect to receive cash and 5% of the
outstanding VMware shares do not make an election, you will receive cash in exchange for 65.625 of your
shares of VMware common stock and Broadcom common stock in exchange for 34.375 of your shares of
VMware common stock.
No fractional shares of Broadcom common stock will be issued in the second merger, and holders of VMware
common stock will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom common stock.
Prior to the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom will enter into an exchange agent agreement with a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to VMware. At or prior to the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom
will deposit (i) cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration
and, to the extent determinable, cash in lieu of fractional shares and (ii) evidence of Broadcom common stock in book-
entry form representing the number of shares of Broadcom common stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate stock
consideration.
As described above, VMware stockholders will not receive any fractional shares of Broadcom common stock in the
second merger. Instead, a VMware stockholder who otherwise would have received a fractional share of Broadcom
common stock will be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount determined by
multiplying (i) the last reported sale price of Broadcom common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (as
reported in the Wall Street Journal, or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by
Broadcom and VMware) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the effective time of the second merger
by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Broadcom common stock held by such holder at
the effective time of the second merger and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
of Broadcom common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.
If a dividend or other distribution is declared with respect to shares of Broadcom common stock with a record date
after the effective time of the second merger, such declaration will include a dividend or other distribution in respect
of all shares of Broadcom common stock issuable pursuant to the merger agreement.
The merger agreement provides that VMware stockholders will be provided with an election form and other
customary transmittal materials. The election form will allow each holder of VMware common stock to specify (i) the
number of shares of VMware common stock owned by such holder with respect to which such holder desires to
receive the cash consideration and (ii) the number of shares of VMware common stock owned by such holder with
respect to which such holder desires to receive the stock consideration.
Broadcom and VMware will initially make available and mail the election form at least 20 business days prior to the
anticipated election deadline to holders of record as of the fifth business day prior to such mailing date. Following
the mailing date, Broadcom and VMware will use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible an
election form to any stockholder who requests an election form prior to the election deadline. The election deadline
will be 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the exchange agent is located) on the date that is
five business days prior to Broadcom’s good faith estimate of the closing date or such other date as may be mutually
agreed to by the parties. Broadcom and VMware will cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to
each of them announcing the election deadline at least three business days prior to the election deadline.
To make a valid election, a VMware stockholder must submit to the exchange agent a properly completed and signed
election form (including duly executed transmittal materials included in the election form). The election form must also
be accompanied by any certificates representing all certificated shares of VMware common stock to which such
election form relates (or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such
election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the
United States).
91
TABLE OF CONTENTS
A VMware stockholder may change or revoke an election by providing written notice to the exchange agent, which
must be received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline, accompanied by a properly completed and
signed revised election form, or by withdrawing his or her shares of VMware common stock previously deposited
with the exchange agent. If any election is not properly made with respect to any shares of VMware common stock,
such election will be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of VMware common stock covered by such election
will be deemed to be non-election shares, unless a proper election is subsequently timely made.
After the effective time of the second merger, shares of VMware common stock will no longer be outstanding, will be
cancelled and will cease to exist and each certificate or book entry share that previously represented shares of
VMware common stock (other than (i) cancelled shares, (ii) dissenting shares and (iii) excluded shares) will represent
only the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement, cash in lieu of fractional shares
and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, as described above. With respect to such shares of Broadcom
common stock deliverable upon the surrender of VMware stock certificates or book-entry shares, until holders of
such VMware stock certificates or book-entry shares have properly surrendered such stock certificates or book-entry
shares to the exchange agent (or another agent appointed by Broadcom) for exchange, along with a duly completed
letter of transmittal in the case of holders of certificates and any other documents as may customarily be required by
the exchange agent, those holders will not receive the merger consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
any dividends or distributions that become due to the holders of converted VMware common stock.
Promptly (and within five business days) after the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom will cause the
exchange agent to mail to each record holder of certificates who has not previously submitted an election notice with
duly executed transmittal materials and whose shares of VMware common stock were converted in the second merger
into the right to receive the merger consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering VMware
share certificates in exchange for payment of the merger consideration. Holders of book-entry shares whose shares of
VMware common stock were converted in the second merger into the right to receive the merger consideration will
not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent to receive the merger
consideration. Upon surrender of VMware share certificates or book-entry shares and a duly executed letter of
transmittal in the case of holders of certificates to the exchange agent (or another agent appointed by Broadcom) in
compliance with the instructions for surrender, such holders will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and
any fractional share cash amounts.
Broadcom will instruct the exchange agent to accept the certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the exchange agent may impose, to effect an orderly exchange in accordance with normal exchange
practices. The time that any individual VMware stockholder receives its, his or her merger consideration will vary
depending on the underlying arrangements through which such VMware stockholder holds its, his or her shares of
VMware common stock.
Litigation Relating to the Transactions
In connection with the transactions, five complaints have been filed as individual actions in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York and one complaint has been filed as an individual action in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaints are captioned as follows: (1) Stein v.
VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06307 (filed July 25, 2022); (2) O’Dell v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06352 (filed July 26,
2022); (3) Whitfield v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-06527 (filed August 1, 2022); (4) Waterman v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-
cv-06533 (filed August 2, 2022); (5) Laufer v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-5146 (filed September 9, 2022); and (6)
Chapman v. VMware, Inc., et al., 22-cv-7735 (filed September 11, 2022) (collectively referred to as the Complaints).
The Complaints generally allege that this proxy statement/prospectus misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly
material information. The Complaints assert violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder against VMware and the members of the VMware board of directors. The Complaints seek,
among other things; an injunction enjoining the consummation of the transactions; direction that a registration
statement is disseminated, including certain additional information, rescission or rescissory damages in the event the
transactions are consummated; declaration that defendants violated Section 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act,
as well as SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder; direction that defendants account for all damages suffered as a
result of any misconduct; costs of the action,
92
TABLE OF CONTENTS
including plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees; and other relief the court may deem just and proper. In addition
to the Complaints, beginning on July 20, 2022, certain purported stockholders of VMware sent demand letters
(referred to as the Demands, and together with the Complaints, the Matters) alleging similar deficiencies regarding the
disclosures made in this proxy statement/prospectus, and seek additional disclosures to address those purported
deficiencies.
VMware cannot predict the outcomes of the Matters. VMware management believes that the Matters are without
merit and intends to vigorously defend against the Matters and any subsequent similar demands or filed actions. If
additional similar complaints are filed or demands sent, absent new or significantly different allegations, VMware will
not necessarily disclose such additional filings or demands.
Dividend Policy
Broadcom currently pays regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. Broadcom most recently paid a cash
dividend on June 30, 2022, of $4.10 per share. Broadcom currently expects to continue to pay quarterly cash
dividends, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by Broadcom’s board of directors. The
payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including Broadcom’s financial performance,
outlook and liquidity.
Subsequent to VMware’s initial public offering in August 2007, VMware has not declared or paid regular cash
dividends on its common stock.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, during the period before the closing of the transactions, Broadcom is not
permitted to pay any special cash dividends on its capital stock other than regular, quarterly cash dividends
(including any increases to current dividend rates approved by the Broadcom board in good faith) and VMware is
not permitted to pay any dividends or make any distributions on its capital stock, in each case without the consent of
Broadcom.
Listing of Broadcom Common Stock; Delisting of VMware Common Stock
It is a condition to the consummation of the transactions that the shares of Broadcom common stock to be issued to
VMware stockholders in the second merger be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to
official notice of issuance. As a result of the second merger, shares of VMware common stock will cease to be listed
on the New York Stock Exchange.

The following describes the material provisions of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this
proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the material provisions of the
merger agreement below and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the merger agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information
about the merger agreement that is important to you. Broadcom and VMware encourage you to read carefully the
merger agreement in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the merger as it is the legal document
governing the transactions.
Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding
the terms of the merger agreement. Broadcom and VMware are responsible for considering whether additional
disclosure of material information is required to make the statements in this proxy statement/prospectus not
misleading. Factual disclosures about Broadcom and VMware contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or
Broadcom’s or VMware’s public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures
about Broadcom or VMware contained in the merger agreement and described in the summary. The representations,
warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by Broadcom, Broadcom Merger Subs and VMware,
Holdco and Merger Sub 1 are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by the parties to the merger
agreement in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to
bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger
agreement, and were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the merger
agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a
contractual standard of materiality that may be different from that generally relevant to stockholders or applicable
to reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases are qualified by confidential disclosures that were
made by each party to the other, which disclosures are not publicly disclosed. The representations and warranties
in the merger agreement will not survive the completion of the transactions. Moreover, information concerning the
subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the merger agreement. For
the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should
not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the
section titled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Transactions
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with Delaware law:
•
the first merger will occur in which Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware, and VMware will
survive the first merger and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub 1 will cease;
•
following the effective time of the first merger, the LLC conversion will occur in which VMware will be
converted into a Delaware limited liability company in accordance with Section 266 of the DGCL and
Section 18-214 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act;
•
following the effective time of the LLC conversion, the second merger will occur in which Merger Sub 2 will
merge with and into Holdco, and Holdco will survive the second merger and become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Broadcom and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub 2 will cease; and
•
following the effective time of the second merger, the third merger will occur in which Holdco will merge
with and into Merger Sub 3, and Merger Sub 3 will survive the third merger as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Broadcom and the separate corporate existence of Holdco will cease.
Within 60 business days of the date of the merger agreement, Broadcom may elect, with VMware’s prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to implement an alternative transaction
94TABLE OF CONTENTS
structure. Under this alternative transaction structure, the first merger and the LLC conversion will be eliminated, and
the structure of the second merger will be modified such that it consists of Merger Sub 2 merging with and into
VMware, with VMware surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom and the separate existence of Merger
Sub 2 ceasing and the third merger will be modified such that it consists of the surviving corporation in the second
merger merging with and into Merger Sub 3, with Merger Sub 3 surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom.
If the alternative transaction structure is adopted, the parties will enter into an amendment to the merger agreement
implementing the alternative transaction structure.
Closing; Effective Time
Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, the closing of the transactions will occur on the third business day
following the date on which all conditions to the transactions set forth in the merger agreement have been satisfied,
or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the closing of the transactions, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
waiver of such conditions at the closing of the transactions). The first merger will be effective as of 11:59 p.m., New
York City time, on the business day prior to the closing date. The second merger will be effective at 8:30 a.m., New
York City time, on the closing date or at such other date and time as is agreed to by the parties and specified in the
certificate of merger for the second merger.
In the event that, pursuant to the terms described in the immediately preceding paragraph, the closing of the
transactions would occur on a date that is within 35 days of the last day of Broadcom’s fiscal year or any other
Broadcom fiscal quarter, Broadcom may irrevocably elect to defer the closing of the transactions until the first
business day of the immediately succeeding fiscal year or fiscal quarter, respectively, unless another date or time is
agreed to in writing by VMware and Broadcom. Upon making such written election, (x) each of the conditions to the
obligations of Broadcom and Broadcom Merger Subs to consummate the transactions (related to accuracy of
VMware’s, Holdco’s and Merger Sub 1’s representations and warranties, compliance with covenants and absence of
a material adverse effect) will be deemed to have been irrevocably fulfilled, other than with respect to a willful breach
by VMware, Holdco or Merger Sub 1 occurring after the date of delivery of such written election, (y) Broadcom will
be deemed to have irrevocably waived its right to terminate the merger agreement as a result of VMware’s, Holdco’s
or Merger Sub 1’s breach, failure to perform or violation of covenants or agreements under the merger agreement or
the inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of VMware, Holdco or Merger Sub 1 in the merger
agreement, other than with respect to a willful breach by VMware, Holdco or Merger Sub 1 occurring after the date of
delivery of such written election, and (z) until the fifth business day of the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter,
neither Broadcom nor VMware will have the right to terminate the merger agreement as a result of the effective time of
the merger not having occurred prior to the outside date.
Effects of the Transactions
At the effective time of the first merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time of the first merger will be converted into one share of common stock of Holdco, and each
outstanding VMware equity award will be converted into a Holdco award that relates to a number of shares of
Holdco common stock that is equal to the number of shares of VMware common stock that were subject to such
award prior to such conversion. All terms and conditions applicable to each such VMware security (including any
VMware equity awards) immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger will, except as described in the
immediately preceding sentence, remain in effect immediately after the effective time of the first merger. After the
consummation of the first merger, all references in this proxy statement/prospectus to VMware, including VMware
common stock, VMware stock options, VMware restricted stock unit awards, VMware equity awards and other
securities of VMware will be deemed, where applicable, to be references to Holdco and the same securities of Holdco,
and all references to VMware stockholders will be deemed to be references to common stockholders of VMware.
At the effective time of the LLC conversion, each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of VMware (then a
wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco) will be converted into one limited liability company interest of VMware
Converted LLC, the entity into which VMware will have converted in connection with its conversion into a limited
liability company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
At the effective time of the second merger, subject to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom
common stock as described below under “-No Fractional Shares” and proration as described below under “-Proration
and Allocation of Merger Consideration,” each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time of the second merger, other than cancelled shares, dissenting shares and excluded shares
as described below under “-Cancellation of Certain VMware Common Stock,” “-Shares of Dissenting Stockholders,”
and “-Conversion of Excluded Shares,” respectively, will be converted into the right to receive, without interest:
•
for each share of VMware common stock with respect to which an election to receive cash (referred to as a
cash election) has been properly made and not revoked (referred to as a cash election share), $142.50 in
cash (referred to as the cash consideration);
•
for each share of VMware common stock with respect to which an election to receive Broadcom common
stock (referred to as a stock election) has been properly made and not revoked (referred to as a stock
election share), 0.25200 of a share of Broadcom common stock (referred to as the stock consideration); and
•
for each share of VMware common stock that is not a cash election share or a stock election share (referred
to as a non-election share), the right to receive cash consideration or stock consideration as determined in
accordance with the proration methodology described below under “-Proration and Allocation of Merger
Consideration.”
The stock consideration will be appropriately adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, subdivision,
consolidation, combination or reclassification with respect to the outstanding shares of Broadcom common stock,
VMware common stock or Holdco common stock, payment of a stock dividend or other distribution in respect of
such shares or the changing of such shares into other securities, in each case that occurs prior to the effective time
of the second merger.
At the effective time of the third merger, each share of capital stock of Holdco (then a wholly owned subsidiary of
Broadcom) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the third merger will be converted into
one limited liability company interest of Merger Sub 3.
No Fractional Shares
Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom common stock as described in the next sentence. Each
holder of VMware common stock that would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Broadcom
common stock in the second merger will instead receive a cash payment equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the fraction of a share of Broadcom common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (accounting
for all shares of VMware common stock held by such holder at the effective time of the second merger), rounded to
the nearest one-thousandth of one share, by (ii) the last reported sale price of Broadcom common stock on The
Nasdaq Global Select Market (as reported in the Wall Street Journal, or if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by Broadcom and VMware) on the last complete trading day prior to the date
of the effective time of the second merger.
Proration and Allocation of Merger Consideration
The total number of shares of VMware common stock to be entitled to receive the cash consideration, referred to as
the maximum cash share number, will be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger (other than any cancelled shares
and excluded shares), and the total number of shares of VMware common stock to be entitled to receive the stock
consideration will be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger (other than any cancelled shares and
excluded shares). Accordingly, depending on the elections made by other holders of VMware common stock, a
holder of VMware common stock may receive a portion of the merger consideration in the form such holder did not
elect.
Within five business days after the effective time of the second merger, VMware will cause the exchange agent for the
payment of the merger consideration, referred to as the exchange agent, to effect the allocation among holders of
VMware common stock of rights to receive the cash consideration and the stock consideration as follows (with the
exchange agent to determine, consistent with the immediately preceding paragraph, whether
96
TABLE OF CONTENTS
fractions of cash election shares, stock election shares and non-election shares, as applicable, will be rounded up or
down):
Oversubscription of Cash Election Option. If the aggregate number of cash election shares (including, for this
purpose, dissenting shares as of the effective time), referred to as the cash election number, equals or exceeds the
maximum cash share number, then
•
the cash election shares of each holder of such cash election shares will be converted into the right to
receive the cash consideration in respect of that number of cash election shares equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of cash election shares held by such holder by (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the maximum cash share number and the denominator of which is the cash election
number, with the remaining number of such holder’s cash election shares being converted into the right to
receive the stock consideration;
•
all stock election shares will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration; and
•
all non-election shares will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration.
Undersubscription of Cash Election Option. If the cash election number is less than the maximum cash share number
(the amount by which the maximum cash share number exceeds the cash election number referred to as the shortfall
number), then
•
all cash election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration;
•
if the shortfall number is less than or equal to the number of non-election shares, then all stock election
shares will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration, and the non-election shares of
each holder of such non-election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration in
respect of that number of non-election shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number
of non-election shares held by such holder by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the shortfall number
and the denominator of which is the total number of non-election shares, with the remaining number of
such holder’s non-election shares being converted into the right to receive the stock consideration; and
•
if the shortfall number exceeds the number of non-election shares, then all non-election shares will be
converted into the right to receive the cash consideration, and stock election shares of each holder of such
stock election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration in respect of that
number of stock election shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of stock
election shares held by such holder by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the
shortfall number exceeds the total number of non-election shares, and the denominator of which is the total
number of stock election shares, with the remaining number of such holder’s stock election shares being
converted into the right to receive the stock consideration.
Cancellation of Certain VMware Common Stock
At the effective time of the second merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time of the second merger that is owned or held in treasury by VMware or owned by Merger Sub
2 or in the treasury of VMware as the surviving company in the first merger, referred to as cancelled shares, will
automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. No consideration will be delivered in exchange for any cancelled
shares.
Conversion of Excluded Shares
Each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second
merger that is owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of VMware, referred to as excluded shares, will automatically
be converted into the right to receive, without interest, the stock consideration.
Shares of Dissenting Stockholders
Shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger
and held by a person, referred to as a dissenting stockholder, (i) who did not vote in favor of approval of the merger
agreement proposal, (ii) who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
97
TABLE OF CONTENTS
such shares of VMware common stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) who complies in all respects with
the provisions of the DGCL concerning the rights of VMware stockholders to require payment by the surviving
corporation of the “fair value” of such shares of VMware common stock, referred as dissenting shares, will not be
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.
Instead, if the second merger is consummated, then dissenting shares will represent the right to receive whatever
consideration may be determined to be due to such dissenting stockholder under Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
dissenting stockholder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262, dissenting shares held by such dissenting stockholder will be treated as though such dissenting shares had
been converted into the right to receive the merger consideration as of the effective time of the second merger.
However, in such case, the proposed dissenting shares will be deemed to be cash election shares, unless such holder
thereafter otherwise make a timely election. If any holder of proposed dissenting shares fails to perfect or has
effectively withdrawn, waived or lost such holder’s right to dissent from the adoption of the merger agreement after
the election deadline, each of such holder’s shares of VMware common stock will be deemed to have been converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration and will be treated as cash election shares. For more information
regarding appraisal rights, see the section titled “Appraisal Rights of VMware Stockholders.” In addition, a copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex F to this proxy statement/prospectus.
Governing Documents; Officers and Directors
Prior to the effective time of the first merger, VMware and Holdco will take all necessary actions to ensure that the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Holdco will be the same as the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
VMware as of the date of the merger agreement, except for the name of Holdco.
At the effective time of the first merger, the certificate of incorporation of VMware as in effect immediately prior to the
effective time of the first merger will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving company in the first merger,
and the bylaws of VMware as in effect immediately prior to effective time of the first merger will be the bylaws of the
surviving company in the first merger. Each of VMware and Merger Sub 1 will take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub 1 immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger to be the initial directors of the
surviving company in the first merger. Each of VMware and Merger Sub 1 will take all necessary action to cause the
officers of VMware immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger to be the initial officers of the surviving
company in the first merger. After the effective time of the first merger until the effective time of the second merger,
Holdco will, and VMware will cause Holdco to, ensure that the officers and directors of VMware immediately prior to
the effective time of the first merger will be the officers and directors of Holdco.
At the effective time of the LLC conversion, VMware Converted LLC will adopt a limited liability company agreement
in a form customary for a single member, member-managed limited liability company that is treated as disregarded as
an entity separate from Holdco for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which limited liability company agreement must
be acceptable in form and substance to Broadcom.
At the effective time of the second merger, the certificate of incorporation of Holdco as in effect immediately prior to
the effective time of the second merger will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving company in the second
merger, and the bylaws of Holdco as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger will be the
bylaws of the surviving company in the second merger. Each of the parties will take all necessary action to cause the
directors and officers of Merger Sub 2 immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger to be the initial
directors and officers of the surviving company in the second merger.
At the effective time of the third merger, the certificate of formation of Merger Sub 3 as in effect immediately prior to
the effective time of the third merger will be the certificate of formation of the surviving company in the third merger,
and the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub 3 as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the
third merger will be the limited liability company agreement of the surviving company in the third merger. Each of the
parties will take all necessary action to cause the officers of the surviving company in the second merger immediately
prior to the effective time of the third merger to be the initial officers of the surviving company in the third merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Election Procedures
Each holder of shares of VMware common stock to be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration,
referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as a holder, may specify in a request made in accordance with the
procedures described in this “-Election Procedures” section (i) the number of shares of VMware common stock
owned by such holder with respect to which such holder desires to make a stock election and (ii) the number of
shares of VMware common stock owned by such holder with respect to which such holder desires to make a cash
election. Any such request is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as an election.
The merger agreement provides that Broadcom will prepare a form reasonably acceptable to VMware, including
appropriate and customary transmittal materials, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the election form,
so as to permit holders to exercise their right to make an election.
Broadcom and VMware (i) will initially make available and mail the election form at least 20 business days prior to the
anticipated election deadline (as defined below) to holders of record of VMware common stock as of the fifth
business day prior to such mailing date, and (ii) following such mailing date, will use all reasonable efforts to make
available as promptly as possible an election form to any VMware stockholder who requests such election form prior
to the election deadline. The time period between such mailing date and the election deadline is referred to in this
proxy statement/prospectus as the election period.
Any election will have been made properly only if the exchange agent will have received, during the election period,
an election form properly completed and executed (including duly executed transmittal materials included in the
election form) and accompanied by any certificates representing all certificated shares to which such election form
relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such election form,
from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States.
Unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties to the merger agreement, election deadline means 5:00 p.m. local
time (in the city in which the principal office of the exchange agent is located) on the date that is five business days
prior to Broadcom’s good faith estimate of the closing date or such other date as may be mutually agreed to by the
parties. Broadcom and VMware will cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them
announcing the date of the election deadline at least three business days prior to the election deadline.
Any holder may, at any time during the election period, change or revoke his, her or its election by written notice to
the exchange agent prior to the election deadline accompanied by a properly completed and executed revised election
form. If any election is not properly made with respect to any shares of VMware common stock (none of Broadcom,
VMware or the exchange agent being under any duty to notify any holder of any such defect), such election will be
deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of VMware common stock covered by such election will be deemed to be
non-election shares, unless a proper election is thereafter timely made.
Any holder may, at any time during the election period, revoke his, her or its election by written notice received by
the exchange agent prior to the election deadline or by withdrawal prior to the election deadline of his, her or its
certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the exchange agent. All
elections will be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the exchange agent of written notification from the
parties that the merger agreement has been terminated.
Subject to the election form, Broadcom, in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, will have the right to
make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of the merger agreement, governing (i) the validity of the
forms of election and compliance by any holder with the election procedures described in this “-Election Procedures”
section, (ii) the method of issuance of shares of Broadcom common stock into which shares of VMware common
stock are converted in the second merger and (iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of VMware common
stock converted into the right to receive the cash consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Broadcom
common stock.
Exchange and Payment Procedures
Prior to the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom will enter into an exchange agent agreement with a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to VMware. Prior to or at the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom will
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the exchange agent (i) cash in immediately
99
TABLE OF CONTENTS
available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration and all fractional share cash amounts
as is necessary for the payment to holders of VMware common stock and (ii) evidence of Broadcom common stock in
book-entry form representing the number of shares of Broadcom common stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate
stock consideration. Such cash and book-entry shares, together with any dividends or other distributions with
respect to such book-entry shares, are referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the exchange fund. No such
deposits will be required to be made with respect to any dissenting shares.
Exchange of VMware Share Certificates and Book-Entry VMware Shares
Promptly (and within five business days) after the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom will cause the
exchange agent to mail to each record holder of certificates who has not previously submitted an election notice with
duly executed transmittal materials and whose shares of VMware common stock were converted in the second merger
into the right to receive the merger consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering VMware
share certificates in exchange for payment of the merger consideration. Holders of book-entry shares whose shares of
VMware common stock were converted in the second merger into the right to receive the merger consideration will
not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent to receive the merger
consideration. Upon surrender of VMware share certificates or book-entry shares and a duly executed letter of
transmittal in the case of holders of certificates to the exchange agent (or to another agent appointed by Broadcom)
in compliance with the instructions for surrender, such holders will be entitled to receive the merger consideration
and any fractional share cash amounts.
Broadcom will instruct the exchange agent to accept the certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the exchange agent may impose, to effect an orderly exchange in accordance with normal exchange
practices. The time that any individual stockholder receives its, his or her merger consideration will vary depending
on the underlying arrangements through which such stockholder holds its, his or her shares of VMware common
stock.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of VMware common stock that is not registered in VMware’s
transfer or stock records, cash may be paid and/or shares may be issued to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered VMware share certificate or book-entry share is registered if such certificate or book-entry
share is presented to the exchange agent accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the exchange agent and Broadcom that any applicable
stock transfer or other similar taxes have been paid.
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates
In the event that an VMware share certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the previous holder of the VMware share
certificate may obtain the merger consideration and the amount of any owed dividends or distributions in respect of
such certificate by (i) making an affidavit regarding the loss, theft or destruction of the VMware share certificate and
(ii) if required by Broadcom or the exchange agent, providing an indemnity (in a reasonable amount as determined by
Broadcom or the exchange agent) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Broadcom, the surviving
company in the third merger, VMWare Converted LLC or the exchange agent with respect to the lost, stolen or
destroyed VMware share certificate.
No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any VMware share certificates or in respect
of any book-entry shares.
Dividends and Distributions
No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time of the second merger with respect to
Broadcom common stock will be paid to the holder of any shares of VMware common stock until such holder
properly surrenders its shares in accordance with the procedures described in this “-Exchange and Payment
Procedures” section. After proper surrender, Broadcom will cause such holder to be paid, without interest, (i) the
amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time of the second merger and
paid with respect to such shares of Broadcom common stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the merger
agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the effective time of the second merger but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Broadcom common stock. After the effective time of the
second merger, Broadcom will cause VMware to pay on the applicable payment
100
TABLE OF CONTENTS
date the amount of any dividends or other distributions on shares of VMware common stock that have a record date
prior to the effective time of the second merger and a payment date after the effective time of the second merger.
Rights of VMware Stockholders Following the Effective Time of the Second Merger and Transfers Following the
Effective Time of the Second Merger
The shares of Broadcom common stock delivered and the cash paid in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement in respect of any shares of VMware common stock will be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of VMware common stock (subject to any appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL). From and after the effective time of the second merger, all holders of VMware share
certificates and book-entry shares will cease to have any rights as stockholders of VMware other than the right to
receive the merger consideration upon the surrender of such shares (together with the fractional share cash amount
and any dividends or other distributions to which such shares become entitled in accordance with the merger
agreement), without interest. From and after the effective time of the second merger, the stock transfer books of
VMware will be closed with respect to all shares of VMware common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the second merger. From and after the effective time of the second merger, there will be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of VMware and any certificates or book-entry shares formerly
representing shares of VMware common stock that are presented to Broadcom or the exchange agent for any reason
will be cancelled and exchanged for the merger consideration in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement
(subject to any appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL).
None of the parties to the merger agreement or the exchange agent will be liable to any person with respect to any
portion of the exchange fund or the merger consideration delivered to a public official if required by any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Further, any portion of the merger consideration that remains
undistributed to holders of VMware share certificates and book-entry shares immediately prior to the date on which
the merger consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity will, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Broadcom, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled to such claims or interest.
Withholding Rights
Each party to the merger agreement, the exchange agent and any other person with a withholding obligation under
applicable law will be entitled to deduct and withhold, from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the merger
agreement, any amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to such payment under the Code or any
other applicable tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
governmental entity, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to
the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.
Treatment of VMware Equity Awards
Treatment of Stock Options
At the effective time of the second merger, each outstanding and in-the-money VMware stock option will become
vested and will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each net option share
subject to such stock option, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the stock consideration,
less applicable tax withholding. For this purpose, net option shares are calculated as the number of shares of VMware
common stock having a value equal to the in-the-money value of the stock option based on the value of the merger
consideration, with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the volume weighted
average sale price of Broadcom common stock over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the second to last
trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the second merger (referred to as the Broadcom trading price).
Treatment of Restricted Stock Units
At the effective time of the second merger:
•
each outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee director will become vested
and will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each share
101
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of VMware common stock subject to such award, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and
50% of the stock consideration;
•
each outstanding time-based VMware restricted stock unit award that is not held by a non-employee
director will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange
ratio calculated as the sum of (i) 50% of the stock consideration and (ii) 50% of the cash consideration
divided by the Broadcom trading price; and
•
each outstanding performance-based VMware restricted stock unit award will be converted into a
Broadcom restricted stock unit award using the same formula described in the above bullet, provided that
(i) for each such award granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit plan, performance
goals will be deemed achieved (1) at the actual level with respect to performance periods completed prior to
the closing of the transactions, or (2) at target level with respect to performance periods not completed
prior to the closing of the transactions; and (ii) for each such award that was granted under the VMware
TSR performance stock unit plan, performance will be measured at the closing of the transactions based on
the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals based on the value of merger
consideration (with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the
Broadcom trading price).
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, VMware, the VMware board or the compensation committee of the
VMware board, as applicable, will take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of VMware’s employee stock
purchase plan, as amended (referred to as the ESPP) to terminate the ESPP effective as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the second merger, contingent upon the occurrence of the second merger, and to provide that, (i) no
offering or purchase period will be continued or commenced under the ESPP, except for any offering or purchase
period under VMware’s ESPP that was in effect on the date of the merger agreement (referred to as the current ESPP
offering period); (ii) no new participants may elect to participate in the ESPP during the current ESPP offering period;
and (iii) no participant may increase the participant’s payroll deductions with respect to the current ESPP offering
period. The final exercise date under the current ESPP offering period shall be the earlier of (A) the normal exercise
date for the current ESPP offering period and (B) five business days prior to the effective time of the second merger
(such earlier date is referred to as the final exercise date). Each ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under
the ESPP will be used to purchase shares of VMware common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of
the final exercise date, which shares will be treated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, and as
promptly as practicable following the purchase of such shares in accordance with this sentence, VMware will return
to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase.

warranties contained in the merger agreement will expire at the effective time of the second merger. The
representations, warranties and covenants made by VMware, Holdco and Merger Sub 1 in the merger agreement are
qualified by information contained in the confidential disclosure schedules delivered to Broadcom in connection with
the execution of the merger agreement and by certain filings that VMware has made with the SEC prior to the date of
the merger agreement, and the representations, warranties and covenants made by Broadcom and Broadcom Merger
Subs in the merger agreement are qualified by information contained in the confidential disclosure schedules
delivered to VMware in connection with the execution of the merger agreement and by certain filings that Broadcom
has made with the SEC prior to the date of the merger agreement. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries of
these representations, warranties and covenants under the merger agreement and should not rely on the
representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts
or condition of VMware or any of its affiliates or of Broadcom or any of its affiliates.
Material Adverse Effect
A “material adverse effect” with respect to VMware or Broadcom, as applicable, means any change, effect,
development, circumstance, condition, fact, state of facts, event or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business,
assets, liabilities or results of operations of Broadcom and its subsidiaries or VMware and its subsidiaries, as
applicable, taken as a whole, except that no such change, effect, development, circumstance, condition, fact, state of
facts, event or occurrence to the extent resulting or arising from any of the following will be deemed to constitute a
material adverse effect or will be taken into account when determining whether a material adverse effect exists or has
occurred or is reasonably expected to exist or occur:
(a)
any changes in general U.S. or global economic conditions, including any changes affecting financial,
credit, foreign exchange or capital market conditions;
(b)
any changes in general conditions in any industry or industries in which VMware and its subsidiaries or

Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, in each case, in connection with or in
response to COVID-19 or another pandemic;
(f)
any failure by VMware or Broadcom, as applicable, to meet any internal or published projections, estimates
or expectations of VMware’s or Broadcom’s, as applicable, revenue, earnings or other financial performance
or results of operations for any period, in and of itself, or any failure by VMware or Broadcom, as
applicable. to meet its internal budgets, plans or forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other financial
performance or results of operations, in and of itself (except that the facts or occurrences giving rise or
contributing to such failure that are not otherwise excluded from the
104
TABLE OF CONTENTS
definition of a “material adverse effect” may be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether
a material adverse effect exists or has occurred or is reasonably expected to exist or occur);
(g)
any changes in geopolitical conditions, acts of terrorism or sabotage, war (whether or not declared), the
commencement, continuation or escalation of a war, acts of armed hostility, weather conditions, natural
disasters, pandemics (including COVID-19) or other force majeure events, including any material worsening
of such conditions threatened or existing as of the date of the merger agreement;
(h)
the execution and delivery of the merger agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, or the public announcement of the merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including any litigation arising out of or relating to the merger
agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the identity of Broadcom, departures
of officers or employees, changes in relationships with suppliers or customers or other business relations,
in each case only to the extent resulting from the execution and delivery of the merger agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or the public announcement of
the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (except that this clause (h)
will not apply to any representation or warranty to the extent the purpose of such representation or
warranty is to address the consequences resulting from the execution and delivery of the merger agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or to address the
consequences of litigation);
(i)
any action or failure to take any action which action or failure to act is requested in writing by Broadcom or
VMware, as applicable, or any action expressly required by, or the failure to take any action expressly
prohibited by, the terms of the merger agreement (other than with respect to certain covenants relating to
VMware’s conduct of business pending the transactions);
(j)
any change in the price or trading volume of shares of VMware or Broadcom common stock, as applicable,
or any other publicly traded securities of VMware or its subsidiaries or Broadcom or its subsidiaries, as
applicable, in and of itself (except that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such change
that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of a “material adverse effect” may be taken into account
for the purpose of determining whether a material adverse effect exists or has occurred or is reasonably
expected to exist or occur);
(k)
any requirements imposed by any governmental entities as a condition to obtaining the required regulatory
approvals;
(l)
any reduction in the credit rating of VMware or its subsidiaries or Broadcom or its subsidiaries, as
applicable, in and of itself (except that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such reduction
that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of a “material adverse effect” may be taken into account
for the purpose of determining whether a material adverse effect exists or has occurred or is reasonably
expected to exist or occur);
however, with respect to the exceptions in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g), if such change, effect, development,
circumstance, condition, fact, state of facts, event or occurrence has had a disproportionate adverse impact on
VMware or any of its subsidiaries or Broadcom or any of its subsidiaries, as applicable, relative to other companies
operating in the industry or industries in which VMware and its subsidiaries or Broadcom or its subsidiaries, as
applicable, operate, then the incremental disproportionate adverse impact of such change, effect, development,
circumstance, condition, fact, state of facts, event or occurrence will be taken into account for the purpose of
determining whether a “material adverse effect” exists or has occurred or is reasonably expected to exist or occur.

Go Shop; No Solicitation of Other Offers by VMware
The merger agreement provides that from the date thereof until 11:59 p.m. Pacific time, on July 5, 2022 (referred to as

VMware and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, to any personnel, of VMware or any subsidiary of VMware to any person and its

that VMware also provides Broadcom, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such non-public
information is provided or made available to such person or its representatives or financing sources, any
non-public information furnished to such other person or its representatives or financing sources that was
not previously furnished to Broadcom; and
(c)
engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in, any discussions or negotiations with any
persons and their respective representatives (and financing sources) with respect to any acquisition
proposals (or inquiries, proposals or offers or other efforts that could lead to any acquisition proposals),
and cooperate with or assist or participate in or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions
or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any acquisition proposals, including granting a waiver,
amendment or release under any pre-existing standstill or similar provision to the extent necessary to allow

under the prior paragraph, VMware has agreed that, from and after the date of the merger agreement until the earlier
of the effective time of the second merger or the date (if any) the merger agreement is validly terminated, VMware will
not, and VMware will cause its subsidiaries not to, and VMware will cause its and their other respective directors,
officers, employees and other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
(a)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of providing non-public information)
any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer,
in each case which constitutes or could be reasonably expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;
110
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(b)
participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information relating to
VMware or any subsidiary of VMware in connection with an acquisition proposal, other than to state that
VMware and its representatives are prohibited under the merger agreement from engaging in any such
discussions or negotiations;
(c)
adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any
acquisition proposal;
(d)
withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise publicly propose to withdraw, change, amend,

stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement;
(e)
if an acquisition proposal has been publicly disclosed, fail to publicly recommend against any such
acquisition proposal within 10 business days after Broadcom’s written request that VMware do so (or
subsequently withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to do so, in a manner
adverse to Broadcom, such rejection of such acquisition proposal) and reaffirm the VMware board’s
recommendation that VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement within such 10 business
day period (or, with respect to any acquisition proposals or material amendments, revisions or changes to
the terms of any such previously publicly disclosed acquisition proposal that are publicly disclosed within
the last 10 business days’ prior to the then-scheduled VMware stockholders’ meeting, fail to take the
actions referred to in this clause (e), with references to the applicable 10 business day period being

(f)
fail to include the VMware board’s recommendation that VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger
agreement in this proxy statement/prospectus;
(g)
approve, or authorize, or cause or permit VMware or any VMware subsidiary to enter into, any merger

understanding, agreement in principle, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
similar agreement or document relating to, or any other agreement or commitment providing for, any
acquisition proposal (other than certain confidentiality agreements); or
(h)
commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.
We refer to the actions set forth in clauses (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) (to the extent related to the foregoing clause (c),
(d), (e), (f) or (g)) above as a “change of recommendation.”
In addition, under the merger agreement, VMware has agreed that:
VMware will, and VMware will cause its subsidiaries to, and VMware will cause its and their other respective
directors, officers, employees and other representatives to, immediately following the no-shop period start date,
cease any and all existing solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any persons, or provision of any non-public
information to any persons, with respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;
VMware will promptly following the no-shop period start date (and in any event within three business days following
the no-shop period start date), (x) request that each person (other than Broadcom) that previously executed a
confidentiality agreement with VMware in connection with its consideration of an acquisition proposal or a potential
acquisition proposal within the three years prior to the no-shop period start date promptly destroy or return to
VMware all non-public information furnished by VMware or any of its representatives to such person or any of its
representatives in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement, and (y) terminate access to any
physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible acquisition proposal by any such person and its
representatives.
Under the merger agreement and from and after the no-shop period start date, VMware must enforce, and not waive,
terminate or modify without Broadcom’s prior written consent, any confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in
any confidentiality, standstill or other agreement; however, if the VMware board determines in good faith after
consultation with VMware’s outside legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular standstill provision, or other
provision with similar effect, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable law, VMware may, without the prior written consent of Broadcom but with prior written notice to
Broadcom, waive such standstill provision, or other provision with similar effect,
111
TABLE OF CONTENTS
solely to the extent necessary to permit the applicable person (if it has not been solicited in breach of the non-
solicitation provisions of the merger agreement) to make, on a confidential basis to the VMware board, an acquisition
proposal, conditioned upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such acquisition proposal to Broadcom, in each
case as contemplated by the merger agreement.
Notwithstanding the prohibitions described above, if from and following the no-shop period start date and prior to
the VMware stockholders adopting the merger agreement, VMware receives a bona fide written acquisition proposal
that did not result from a breach (other than a de minimis and unintentional breach) of VMware’s non-solicitation
obligations, (a) VMware may contact the third party making such acquisition proposal solely to inform such person
of VMware’s non-solicitation obligations or (b) VMware may furnish non-public information to such person, its
representatives and debt financing sources, and engage in discussions or negotiations with such person and its
representatives and financing sources, in each case with respect to the acquisition proposal, as long as prior to
taking such action the VMware board determines in good faith, after consulting with VMware’s outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that such proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior
proposal and prior to providing any such non-public information, (x) the person making the acquisition proposal
enters into a confidentiality agreement that contains terms that taken as a whole. are not materially less favorable in
the aggregate to VMware than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between Broadcom and VMware (it
being understood that the confidentiality agreement is not required to include a standstill provision) and that does
not in any way restrict VMware or its representatives from complying with its disclosure obligations under the merger
agreement, and (y) VMware also provides Broadcom, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such
information is provided or made available to such person or its representatives, any non-public information furnished
to such other person or its representatives that was not previously furnished to Broadcom.
Under the merger agreement, VMware is obligated to notify Broadcom promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) of
any receipt by any director or officer of VMware or by any of VMware’s subsidiaries or its or their respective
representatives of any acquisition proposal or any proposals or inquiries that could reasonably be expected to lead
to an acquisition proposal, or any inquiry or request for non-public information relating to VMware or any VMware
subsidiary by any person who has made or could reasonably be expected to make an acquisition proposal, provided
notwithstanding the foregoing, between the date of the merger agreement and the no-shop period start date, VMware
will only be required to notify Broadcom of any receipt by any director or officer of VMware or by any of VMware’s
subsidiaries, or its or their respective representatives, of any acquisition proposal. The notice must include the
identity of the person making the acquisition proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of
any such proposal or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to any such inquiry or request,
including unredacted copies of all written requests, proposals or offers (including any proposed agreements received
by VMware relating to such acquisition proposal) or, if such acquisition proposal is not in writing, a reasonably
detailed written description of the material terms and conditions (with an amendments or proposed amendments to
economic terms being deemed material for this purpose) thereof. VMware also must keep Broadcom reasonably
informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material terms, including any material amendments or
proposed amendments to such material terms (with any amendments or proposed amendments to economic terms
being deemed material for this purpose) of any such acquisition proposal or potential acquisition proposal, and as to
the nature of any information requested of VMware with respect thereto. VMware also must promptly provide (and in
any event within the earlier of 48 hours and one business day) Broadcom with any material non-public information
concerning VMware provided to any other person in connection with any acquisition proposal that was not
previously provided to Broadcom. Without limiting the foregoing, VMware must promptly (and in any event within 24
hours after such determination) inform Broadcom in writing if VMware determines to begin providing information or
to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal to the extent otherwise permitted by the
merger agreement. VMware has agreed that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement with any person
which directly or indirectly prohibits VMware from providing any information to Broadcom in accordance with, or
otherwise complying with, the obligations of VMware described in this paragraph.
Unless the merger agreement has been validly terminated, VMware is obligated not to take any action to exempt any
person other than Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs from the restrictions on any “business combinations”
contained in any applicable takeover statute or in VMware’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or otherwise cause
such restrictions not to apply (other than actions consistent with actions taken in connection with the voting
agreements prior to the approval of any transactions).
112
TABLE OF CONTENTS
An “acquisition proposal” for purposes of the merger agreement and the voting agreements means any offer,
proposal or indication of interest from any person or group (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other
than a proposal or offer by Broadcom or a subsidiary of Broadcom, at any time relating to any transaction or series of
related transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) involving:
•
any acquisition or purchase by any person, directly or indirectly, of more than 20% of any class of
outstanding VMware voting or equity securities (whether by voting power or number of shares);
•
any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
person or group beneficially owning more than 20% of any class of outstanding VMware voting or equity
securities (whether by voting power or number of shares);
•
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture, recapitalization,
reorganization or other similar transaction, in each case involving VMware and any other person or group,
pursuant to which the VMware stockholders immediately prior to such transaction hold less than 80% of
the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction (whether by voting power or
economic interest); or
•
any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition to any person or group of more than 20% of the
consolidated assets of VMware and its subsidiaries (measured by fair market value).
A “superior proposal” for purposes of the merger agreement means a bona fide, written acquisition proposal by a
third party which the VMware board determines in good faith (after consultation with VMware’s outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) to be more favorable to VMware’s stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transactions, taking into account all relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal or
offer (including the transaction consideration, conditionality, timing, certainty of financing and/or regulatory
approvals and likelihood of consummation) and the merger agreement (and any changes to the terms of the merger
agreement proposed by Broadcom in response to any acquisition proposal)), although any acquisition proposal by
the persons executing the voting agreements (or their affiliates) will not constitute a “superior proposal.” When
determining whether an offer constitutes a superior proposal, references in the term “acquisition proposal” to “20%”
or “80%” will be replaced with references to “70%” and “30%,” respectively.
Change of Recommendation; Match Rights
The merger agreement requires the VMware board to recommend that VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger
agreement and not make a change of recommendation as described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
the VMware stockholders adopting the merger agreement:
•
the VMware board may make certain types of a change of recommendation in response to an intervening
event (as defined below) if the VMware board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
VMware’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; or
•
the VMware board may make a change of recommendation and cause VMware to terminate the merger
agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an acquisition proposal that did not
result from a breach (other than a de minimis and unintentional breach) of VMware’s non-solicitation
obligations (subject to payment by VMware to Broadcom of the termination fee described under “-
Termination Fee and Expenses”) which the VMware board has determined in good faith after consultation
with VMware’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors is a superior proposal, but only if the VMware
board has determined in good faith after consultation with VMware’s outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable law.
Prior to making a change of recommendation for any reason set forth above, VMware must provide Broadcom four
business days’ prior written notice advising Broadcom that it intends to make a change of recommendation. The
notice must specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such change of recommendation due to an intervening event
(as defined below), or the material terms and conditions of the acquisition proposal (including a copy of any
proposed definitive agreement) for any change of recommendation due to a superior proposal. In each case, VMware
must cause its representatives (including executive officers) to negotiate in good
113
TABLE OF CONTENTS
faith (to the extent Broadcom desires to negotiate) any proposal by Broadcom to amend the merger agreement in a
manner that would eliminate the need for the VMware board to make a change of recommendation, and the VMware
board must make all of the required determinations regarding its fiduciary duties again at the end of such four
business day negotiation period (after in good faith taking into account the amendments to the merger agreement
proposed by Broadcom). With respect to any change of recommendation in response to a superior proposal, if there
is any material amendment, revision or change to the terms of the then-existing superior proposal (including any
revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration proposed to be received by VMware’s stockholders as a result of
such superior proposal), VMware must again comply with the obligations described in this paragraph, except that
references to the applicable four business day period will be replaced with two business days.
An “intervening event” for purposes of the merger agreement is any event, change or development first occurring or
arising after the date of the merger agreement that is material to VMware and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and
was not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the VMware board as of the date of the merger agreement (or if
known, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the VMware board as of
the date of the merger agreement), except that in no event will the following events, changes or developments
constitute an “intervening event”: (a) the receipt, existence or terms of an acquisition proposal or any matter relating
thereto or consequence thereof or (b) changes in the market price or trading volume of shares of VMware common
stock or Broadcom common stock or any other securities of VMware, Broadcom or their respective subsidiaries, or
any change in credit rating or the fact that VMware meets or exceeds internal or published estimates, projections,
forecasts or predictions for any period (except that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such
changes may be taken into account to the extent not otherwise excluded).
Nothing in the merger agreement prohibits VMware or the VMware board from (a) disclosing to VMware’s
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (b) making
any “stop, look and listen” communication to VMware’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, or any similar statement in response to any publicly disclosed acquisition proposal, (c) making any
factually accurate public statement that solely describes VMware’s receipt of an acquisition proposal, the terms
thereof and the identity of the person making such acquisition proposal, and the operation of the merger agreement
with respect thereto or (d) making any disclosure to the stockholders of VMware, if the VMware board determines in
good faith (after consultation with VMware’s outside legal counsel) that the failure to so disclose would be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the VMware board under applicable law; provided
that, in each case, any such disclosure also includes an express reaffirmation of the VMware’s board recommendation
that VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.
Actions with Respect to VMware Debt
At the closing, VMware will deliver all notices and take other actions to facilitate the termination of all commitments
and the repayment of all obligations outstanding under each of (i) the Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of
September 2, 2021, by and among VMware, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the lenders party thereto and (ii) the
Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of September 2, 2021, by and among VMware, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the
other borrowers party thereto and the other lenders party thereto (together, referred to as the credit facilities).
Access; Integration Committee; Strategic Transactions
The merger agreement provides that from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective time of the
second merger or the date (if any) the merger agreement is validly terminated, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, VMware and its subsidiaries will give Broadcom and its representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to VMware’s and its subsidiaries’ offices, properties, contracts,
personnel, books and records (so long as any such access does not unreasonably interfere with VMware’s
business), and will furnish as promptly as practicable to Broadcom all information concerning VMware’s business,
properties and personnel as Broadcom reasonably requests (including information for the purposes of transition and
integration planning). However, VMware is not required to provide access to or disclose information that may not be
disclosed pursuant to certain contractual or legal restrictions or that is subject to attorney-client, attorney work
product or other legal privilege, in each case subject to certain exceptions and requirements to make substitute
arrangements.
114
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The merger agreement provides that Broadcom and VMware will establish a transition and integration planning team,
which will discuss and plan for a transition and integration planning process concerning the combination of the
operations of Broadcom, VMware and their respective subsidiaries after the closing of the transactions, and will meet
from time to time as reasonably requested by Broadcom’s chief executive officer.
The merger agreement provides that in connection with the evaluation of strategic transactions involving any assets,
properties or businesses of Holdco, VMware or any subsidiary or business of the foregoing that Broadcom may
undertake, Broadcom will be permitted to provide, with prior notice to VMware, information about such assets,
properties or businesses to potential counterparties thereof (and their representatives) so long as (i) such potential
counterparties are subject to a customary nondisclosure agreement with Broadcom (to which VMware is an express
third party beneficiary) and (ii) promptly following the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms, Broadcom shall request in writing that each such potential counterparty promptly destroy or return to VMware
all non-public information of VMware furnished pursuant to such nondisclosure agreement.
Financing Cooperation
Under the merger agreement, prior to the effective time of the second merger, VMware and its subsidiaries will, and
will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their representatives to, provide all customary cooperation and all
customary financial information, in each case, that is reasonably requested by Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs
in connection with any financing obtained by Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs for the purpose of financing the
transactions or any transaction undertaken in connection therewith, subject to certain limitations set forth in the
merger agreement.
In addition, the merger agreement provides that VMware will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and
take all other actions reasonably requested by Broadcom that are required to facilitate in accordance with the terms
thereof the termination of all commitments outstanding under VMware’s credit facilities, the repayment in full of all
obligations, if any, outstanding thereunder, the release of all liens, if any, securing such obligations, and the release
of guarantees in connection therewith on the closing date as of the effective time of the second merger, subject to
certain limitations set forth in the merger agreement. The merger agreement also requires that VMware deliver to
Broadcom at certain dates prior to the closing date customary draft and executed payoff letters and related guarantee
and lien release documentation from the agent on behalf of the lenders under such credit agreements.
The merger agreement also provides that upon written request of Broadcom, VMware will, and will cause its
subsidiaries to, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, in each case, to the trustee under the
indenture governing VMware’s outstanding senior notes at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, such
documents or instruments required to comply with certain requirements of the indenture applicable to each series of
VMware’s outstanding senior notes in connection with the first merger and/or second merger, and provide all
assistance reasonably requested by Broadcom in connection with obtaining the execution of such instruments by the
other parties required to execute such instruments and take any other actions reasonably requested by Broadcom
that are customary or necessary in connection therewith, subject to certain limitations set forth in the merger
agreement.
Employee Matters
During the period commencing at the effective time of the second merger and ending on the first anniversary of the
effective time of the second merger, Broadcom will provide, or will cause its subsidiaries to provide, each employee of
VMware or any of its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Broadcom or any of its subsidiaries following
the effective time (referred to as a continuing employee) with (i) base salary at least equal to that in effect immediately
prior to the effective time of the second merger; (ii) target incentive compensation opportunities (including cash and
equity compensation) and health and welfare benefits (excluding severance) that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those in effect for such continuing employee prior to the effective time of the second merger; and (iii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to such continuing employee prior to the effective
time of the second merger pursuant to certain plans set forth on the confidential disclosure schedules delivered to
Broadcom in connection with the execution of the merger agreement.
For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits but excluding eligibility
to participate or benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or any postemployment health
115
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or welfare plan) under the employee benefit plans of Broadcom and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any
continuing employees after the effective time of the second merger (referred to as the new plans), each continuing
employee will be credited with his or her years of service with VMware and its subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the effective time of the second merger; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, each continuing employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all new plans to the extent that coverage
under such new plan is of the same type as the VMware benefit plan in which such continuing employee participated
(such plans, collectively, referred to as the old plans), and (A) for purposes of each new plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any continuing employee, Broadcom or its applicable subsidiary shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such new plan to be waived and (B) Broadcom and its applicable subsidiary shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such continuing employee during the portion of the plan year of the old
plan ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding new plan begins to be taken into account
under such new plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new plan.
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance
Under the merger agreement, for a period of six years after the effective time of the second merger, VMware
Converted LLC must, and Broadcom must cause VMware Converted LLC to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the organizational documents of VMware or its subsidiaries, or any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom prior
to the date of the merger agreement, each current and former director and officer of VMware and its subsidiaries
against any costs and expenses in connection with any actual or threatened claims in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the effective time of the second merger, in connection with such person serving as an
officer, director, employee or agent of another corporation or of a limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity if such service was at the request of VMware.
In addition, for a period of six years following the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom is required to
maintain in effect the provisions in the organizational documents of VMware and any indemnification agreements in
existence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom (except to the extent such
agreement provides for an earlier termination) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors
and employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence as of the date of the merger agreement.
At or prior to the effective time of the second merger, VMware is required to purchase a directors’ and officers’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance “tail” insurance policy for a period of six years after the effective
time of the second merger with respect to matters arising at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, with a
one-time cost not in excess of 300% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by VMware for its directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance prior to the date of the merger agreement, and if the cost
of such “tail” insurance policy would otherwise exceed such amount, VMware may purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount.

consummation of the transactions unlawful or that would otherwise prevent or delay consummation of the
transactions, using reasonable best efforts to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order.

transactions or (B) that involves or relates to any sales, divestitures or dispositions of any assets, products or
businesses of the semiconductor solutions segment of Broadcom or of any other assets, products or businesses of
Broadcom that are not part of the Broadcom Software Group or (2) provision (in any consent decree or otherwise)
requiring the prior approval of a governmental entity, unless such provision is required by the FTC or the DOJ in
order to obtain the clearance of the transactions under the HSR Act and applies solely to future transactions to
acquire businesses primarily selling products in the same product markets as the products that Broadcom was
required to, and agreed to, sell, divest or dispose pursuant to the covenant in the merger agreement described in the
prior paragraph. Additionally, nothing in the merger agreement requires Broadcom to commit to or effect any action or
agreement that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions.
119
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the merger agreement, Broadcom and VMware also agree to:
•
cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party in
connection with the HSR Act or other antitrust laws;

permit the other party to review in advance any communication that it gives to, and consult with each other
in advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other
applicable governmental entity, or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other
person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or other applicable governmental entity or other
person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in any meetings, substantive
telephone calls or conferences with the DOJ, the FTC or any other governmental entity or other person.
Without limiting Broadcom’s obligation described above to use reasonable best efforts to take all steps as may be
necessary, subject to the limitations described above, to obtain all required approvals, Broadcom and VMware have
agreed that Broadcom will control the ultimate strategy and timing for securing approvals and expiration of relevant
waiting periods under antitrust laws, taking into account in good faith any comments of VMware or its
representatives relating to such strategy.
Each of the parties agree that, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective time of the
second merger and the date, if any, on which the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, it shall
not consummate, enter into any agreement providing for, or announce any investment, acquisition, divestiture,
merger or other business combination that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions.
Termination of the Merger Agreement
Termination by Broadcom or VMware
The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the effective time of the second merger:
•
by mutual written consent of Broadcom and VMware; or
•
by either Broadcom or VMware, if:
•
any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction,
decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions;
•
the effective time of the second merger has not occurred on or before February 26, 2023 (which we
refer to as the “outside date”); however, (i) if, on the outside date, all of the conditions to the
transactions (other than those conditions relating to antitrust approvals or no injunction (to the extent
the relevant injunction or order is in respect of, or any such law is, the HSR Act or any other antitrust
law) or those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived on the closing date of the
transactions (if such conditions would be satisfied or validly waived were the closing of the
transactions to occur at such time)) shall have been satisfied or waived, then the outside date may be
extended, by either VMware or Broadcom by providing written notice to the other party five business
days prior to the outside date, for a period of three months, (ii) if, on the outside date, as extended, all
of the conditions to the transactions (other than those conditions relating to antitrust approvals or no
injunction (to the extent the relevant injunction or order is in respect of, or any such law is, the HSR
Act or any other antitrust law) or those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived on
the closing date of the transactions (if such conditions would be satisfied or validly waived were the
closing of the transactions to occur at such time)), shall have been satisfied or waived, then the
outside date may be further extended, by either Broadcom or VMware by providing written notice five
business days prior to the as extended outside date, for a period of three months, (iii) if, on the outside
date, as extended, all of the

conditions to the transactions (other than those conditions relating to antitrust approvals or no
injunction (to the extent the relevant injunction or order is in respect of, or any such law is, the HSR
Act or any other antitrust law) or those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived on
the closing date of the transactions (if such conditions would be satisfied or validly waived were the
closing of the transactions to occur at such time)), shall have been satisfied or waived, then the
outside date may be further extended, by either Broadcom or VMware by providing written notice five
business days prior to the as extended outside date, for a period of three months and (iv) this right to
terminate will not be available to any party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation was a
proximate cause of the failure of the effective time of the second merger to occur prior to the outside
date and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement; or
•
the special meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) has concluded and the
VMware stockholders have not adopted the merger agreement.
Termination by VMware
The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the effective time of the merger by VMware if:
•
prior to VMware stockholders adopting the merger agreement, the VMware board effects a change of
recommendation with respect to a superior proposal and VMware substantially concurrently enters into a
definitive agreement providing for such superior proposal, as long as (a) VMware has complied in all
material respects with its obligations described under “Go Shop; No Solicitation of Other Offers by
VMware” and “Change of Recommendation; Match Rights” and (b) immediately prior to or substantially
concurrently with (and as a condition to) such termination, VMware pays to Broadcom the $1.5 billion or
$750 million termination fee described below; or
•
(a) Broadcom and/or Broadcom Merger Subs has breached, failed to perform or violated their respective
covenants or agreements under the merger agreement or any of the representations and warranties of
Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs in the merger agreement have become inaccurate; (b) such breach,
failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy would result in the failure of the related conditions to VMware’s,
Holdco’s and Merger Sub 1’s obligations to close the transactions to be satisfied and is incapable of being
cured by the outside date or, if capable of being cured by the outside date, is not cured before the earlier of
the business day immediately prior to the outside date and the 30th calendar day following receipt of
written notice from VMware of such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy; and (c) neither
VMware, Holdco nor Merger Sub 1 is then in material breach of the merger agreement.
Termination by Broadcom
The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the effective time of the second merger by Broadcom if:
•
Prior to the VMware stockholders adopting the merger agreement, the VMware board has effected a change
of recommendation or VMware has willfully breached in a material respect its obligations described under
“Go Shop; No Solicitation of Other Offers by VMware” or “Change of Recommendation; Match Rights”; or
•
(a) VMware, Holdco and/or Merger Sub 1 has breached, failed to perform or violated its covenants or
agreements under the merger agreement or any of the representations and warranties of VMware, Holdco or
Merger Sub 1 in the merger agreement have become inaccurate, (b) such breach, failure to perform,
violation or inaccuracy would result in the failure of the related conditions to Broadcom’s and Broadcom
Merger Subs’ obligation to close the transactions to be satisfied and is incapable of being cured by the
outside date or, if capable of being cured by the outside date, is not cured before the earlier of the business
day immediately prior to the outside date and the 30th calendar day following receipt of written notice from
Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs of such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy and (c)
neither Broadcom nor Broadcom Merger Subs are then in material breach of the merger agreement.

costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will
be paid by the party incurring the cost or expense.
VMware Termination Fee
The merger agreement provides that VMware will pay Broadcom a termination fee of $1.5 billion if:
(a) Broadcom or VMware terminates the merger agreement because the special meeting (including any adjournments
or postponements thereof) has concluded and the VMware stockholders have not adopted the merger agreement, (b)
after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the date of such termination, an acquisition proposal is publicly
disclosed (whether by VMware or a third party) and not publicly withdrawn at least three business days prior to the

definitive agreement providing for an acquisition proposal is entered into;
(a) after the date of the merger agreement and prior to termination of the merger agreement, an acquisition proposal is
made to the VMware board or management or becomes publicly disclosed (whether by VMware or a third party) and
not publicly withdrawn at least three business days prior to such termination, (b) (i) Broadcom or VMware terminates
the merger agreement due to the effective time of the second merger not having occurred on or prior to the outside

VMware terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior
proposal; provided that the termination fee will be $750 million instead of $1.5 billion if the termination occurs prior to
the no-shop period start date.
When determining whether VMware will pay Broadcom a termination fee, the term “acquisition proposal” has the
meaning assigned to such term as described under “Go Shop; No Solicitation of Other Offers by VMware,” except
that all references to “20%” and “80%” will be replaced with references to “50%.”
In no event will VMware be obligated to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion. In the event that the
termination fee is received by Broadcom and, if applicable, costs and expenses in accordance with the merger
agreement, none of VMware, any of its subsidiaries, any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents will have any further liability or with respect
to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to Broadcom or Broadcom Merger
Subs or any of their respective representatives or affiliates, and payment of the termination fee and such costs and
expenses will be Broadcom’s sole and exclusive remedy.
Broadcom Termination Fee
The merger agreement provides that Broadcom will pay VMware a termination fee of $1.5 billion if:
Broadcom or VMware terminates the merger agreement due to the effective time of the second merger not having
occurred on or prior to the outside date, and, at the time of such termination, the condition relating to antitrust
approvals or the condition relating to no injunction (to the extent the relevant injunction or order is in respect of, or
any such law is, the HSR Act or any other antitrust law) has not been satisfied and all of the other conditions and
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on the closing date of the transactions (if such conditions
would be satisfied were the closing of the transactions to occur at the time of such termination), shall have been
satisfied or waived; or

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Broadcom or VMware terminates the merger agreement because any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction
has issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions (if such order, injunction, decree or ruling is by a governmental
entity under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust law).
In no event will Broadcom be obligated to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion. In the event that the
termination fee is received by VMware, and, if applicable, costs and expenses in accordance with the merger
agreement, none of Broadcom, any of its subsidiaries, any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents will have any further liability with respect to
the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to VMware, Holdco or Merger Sub 1
or any of their respective representatives or affiliates, and payment of the termination fee and such costs and
expenses will be VMware’s sole and exclusive remedy.
Effect of Termination
In the event of termination of the merger agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the merger
agreement will become void (except that provisions relating to the effect of termination, payment of the termination
fees and certain other miscellaneous provisions, together with the confidentiality agreement between VMware and
Broadcom, will survive any such termination), and there will be no liability on the part of any of the parties, except
that no party will be relieved of liability for fraud.

Subs in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which actions will be governed by
the laws of the State of New York), the merger agreement is governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of
the law of any other state.

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, on May 26, 2022, Broadcom entered into (i) a voting
agreement (referred to as the MSD voting agreement) with the MSD stockholders and (ii) a voting agreement
(referred to as the SL voting agreement) with the SL stockholders. The following section summarizes material
provisions of the voting agreements. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the
information about the voting agreements that is important to you. This summary is subject to, and qualified in its
entirety by reference to, the MSD voting agreement, which is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement/prospectus, and the SL voting agreement, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement/prospectus, each of which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The rights
and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms and conditions of the voting agreements and not by

voting agreements carefully and in their entirety before making any decisions regarding the merger agreement.
MSD Voting Agreement
Subject to the terms and conditions of the MSD voting agreement, the MSD stockholders have agreed, among other
things, to vote all of the shares of VMware common stock held by them (i) in favor of (1) the adoption of the merger
agreement and (2) any proposal to adjourn or postpone the VMware special meeting to a later date if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the adoption of the merger agreement, and (ii) against (1) any action or agreement that
would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the consummation of the transactions set forth in the
merger agreement not being fulfilled, (2) any acquisition proposal, any agreement or commitment providing for any

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presents the pro forma effects of the
acquisition of VMware by Broadcom.
On May 26, 2022, VMware, Broadcom, Holdco, Merger Sub 1, and Broadcom Merger Subs entered into the merger
agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, (i) Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into VMware, with
VMware surviving the first merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco, (ii) following the effective
time of the first merger, VMware, the surviving company of the first merger, will be converted into a Delaware limited
liability company, (iii) following the effective time of the LLC conversion, Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into
Holdco, with Holdco surviving the second merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom, and (iv)
following the effective time of the second merger, Holdco, the surviving company of the second merger, will merge
with and into Merger Sub 3, with Merger Sub 3 surviving the third merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Broadcom. See the section titled “The Transactions” for additional information on the effects of the transactions
mentioned here.
As a result of the transactions, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the second merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of each holder
of such share of VMware common stock, and subject to proration in accordance with the merger agreement, either:
(a)
$142.50 per share in cash, without interest, or
(b)
0.25200 shares of Broadcom common stock, par value $0.001 per share.
The shareholder election will be subject to a proration mechanism, such that the total number of shares of VMware
common stock entitled to receive the cash consideration, and the total number of shares of VMware common stock
entitled to receive the stock consideration, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of
VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the second merger. See the
section titled “The Transactions - Merger Consideration” for additional information regarding the merger
consideration.
The transactions will be treated as a business combination for accounting purposes. Broadcom is determined to be
the accounting acquirer after taking into account the relative share ownership, the composition of the governing
body of the combined entity, and the designation of certain senior management positions. The purchase price of the
transactions will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their preliminary fair values at
the closing date.
Financing
In connection with the merger agreement, Broadcom entered into a debt commitment letter with certain financial
institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, a senior unsecured
bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32.0 billion. See the section titled “The Transactions - Financing
of the Transactions” for additional information regarding the anticipated financing of the transactions.
Broadcom plans to fund the cash portion of the transactions through a combination of (i) cash on hand and (ii) new
debt financing. Broadcom intends to borrow $32.0 billion for the transactions. Broadcom expects to replace the
commitments in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the transactions with the proceeds from
the issuance of one or more series of senior unsecured debt securities and/or other incurrences of indebtedness.
Since terms of the senior unsecured debt securities and/or other indebtedness are currently unavailable, the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared using the terms of the bridge facility, as
further discussed in Note 6.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
1.
Basis of Presentation
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared in accordance with Article 11 of
Regulation S-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 “Amendments to Financial Disclosures about
Acquired and Disposed Businesses”. The historical information of Broadcom and VMware is presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of July 31, 2022 is prepared using the historical
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets of Broadcom and VMware as of July 31, 2022 and July 29, 2022,
respectively, giving effect to (i) the transactions as if they had been completed on July 31, 2022 and (ii) the
assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended July 31, 2022 and
the year ended October 31, 2021 give effect to (i) the transactions as if they had been completed on November 2,
2020, the beginning of Broadcom’s most recently completed fiscal year and (ii) the assumptions and adjustments
described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended July 31, 2022 is
prepared using Broadcom’s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended
July 31, 2022 and VMware’s unaudited condensed combined statement of income for the nine months ended July 29,
2022, which is derived by adding the audited consolidated statement of income for the year ended January 28, 2022
and unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the six months ended July 29, 2022 and subtracting
the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended October 29, 2021. As the
difference between Broadcom’s and VMware’s fiscal year-end dates is less than one fiscal quarter, the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 is prepared using
Broadcom’s historical audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 and
VMware’s historical audited consolidated statement of income for the year ended January 28, 2022, as permitted
under Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X. However, given the different fiscal year ends, VMware’s historical unaudited
condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended January 28, 2022 is included in both the
fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and the nine months ended July 31, 2022 unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statements of operations. VMware reported revenue of $3.5 billion and net income of $586 million for the
three months ended January 28, 2022.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared using the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with the business combination accounting guidance as provided in Accounting Standards
Codification 805, Business Combinations, with Broadcom treated as the accounting acquirer for the transactions. As
a result of the proration mechanism described in the introduction section, the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information is prepared based on the expectation that 50% of VMware’s common stock are cash
election shares and the remaining 50% of VMware’s common stock are stock election shares.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is provided for informational purposes only and
is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if the transactions had been completed
as of the dates set forth above, nor is it indicative of the future results of Broadcom following the transactions. In
determining the preliminary estimate of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of VMware, Broadcom
used publicly available benchmarking information as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market
participant assumptions. The purchase price allocation relating to the transactions is preliminary and subject to
change, as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. There can be no
assurances that the final valuations will not result in material changes to this preliminary purchase price allocation.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to the potential impact of
any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the transactions or of any
integration costs. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to project the
future operating results or financial position of Broadcom following the transactions.
132

2.
Significant Accounting Policies 
The accounting policies used in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information are those set out in Broadcom’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended October 31,
2021. Upon consummation of the transactions, management will perform a comprehensive review of the accounting
policies between the two entities. Management is currently not aware of any significant accounting policy
differences and has therefore not made any adjustments to the pro forma condensed combined financial information
related to any potential differences. Upon completion of management’s review, management may identify differences
in accounting policies between the two entities which, when conformed, could have a material impact on the financial
statements of Broadcom following the transactions.
Certain reclassifications are reflected in the pro forma adjustments to conform VMware’s presentation to Broadcom’s
in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of operations. These reclassifications
have no effect on previously reported total assets, total liabilities and shareholders’ equity, or net income of
Broadcom or VMware. The pro forma financial information may not reflect all reclassifications necessary to conform
VMware’s presentation to that of Broadcom due to limitations on the availability of information as of the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus. Accounting policy differences and additional reclassification adjustments may be
identified as more information becomes available.
The following reclassification adjustments were made to conform VMware’s presentation to Broadcom’s
presentation:
(a)
Represents the reclassification of deferred tax assets to other long-term assets.
(b)
Represents the reclassification of unearned revenue to other current liabilities, offset by reclassifications of
$1.1 billion of employee related liabilities from other current liabilities to employee compensation and
benefits, and the reclassification of $6 million of current finance lease liabilities from other current liabilities
to current portion of long-term debt.
(c)
Represents the reclassification of unearned revenue - non-current, income tax payable, and operating lease
liabilities to other long-term liabilities offset by the reclassification of $37 million of long-term finance lease
liabilities from other long-term liabilities to long-term debt.
(d)
Represents the reclassification of license revenue, subscription and SaaS revenue, and services revenue to
subscriptions and services revenue.
(e)
Represents the reclassification of cost of license revenue, cost of subscription and SaaS revenue and cost
of services revenue to cost of subscriptions and services revenue (referred to as CoSS).

Represents the reclassification of realignment expense to restructuring, impairment and disposal charges.
3.
Calculation of Merger Consideration and Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation of the Transactions
The estimated preliminary merger consideration of $60,565 million is calculated based on the expectation that 50% of
VMware common stock are cash election shares and the remaining 50% of VMware common stock are stock election
shares due to the proration mechanism. The fair value of the merger consideration expected to be transferred on the
closing date includes the value of the estimated cash consideration; the estimated fair value of approximately 54
million shares of Broadcom common stock to be transferred, calculated by using the price per share of Broadcom
common stock as of September 9, 2022; the estimated fair value of assumed VMware equity awards attributable to
pre-combination services; and the estimated amount of cash to be paid for the repayment of VMware’s outstanding
debt. The calculation of the merger consideration is as follows:
Consideration Transferred
(dollars in
millions)
Estimated cash consideration(1)
$30,265
Estimated fair value of Broadcom common stock to be issued(2)
27,960

Total estimated merger consideration
$60,565
Total cash consideration

Total equity consideration
28,300
Total estimated merger consideration
$60,565
(1)
Represents the estimated cash consideration to be paid, consisting of (i) approximately $30,243 million for the cash election
shares and (ii) approximately $22 million to settle all outstanding VMware stock options and VMware restricted stock unit awards
held by non-employee members of VMware board of directors (referred to as director RSUs). The cash to be paid to settle
VMware stock options and director RSUs included in the merger consideration represents the amount attributable to pre-
combination services. The amount of cash consideration to be paid for the cash election shares is estimated based on $142.50 per
share of VMware common stock. The cash settlement amount to be paid for director RSUs is calculated based on $71.25 per each
share of VMware common stock underlying such award and the cash settlement amount to be paid for VMware stock options is
calculated based on $71.25 per each net option share (net option shares are calculated as the number of shares of VMware
common stock having a value equal to the in-the-money value of the VMware stock option based on the value of the merger
consideration). The calculation of preliminary merger consideration is based on 424,467,467 shares of VMware common stock
outstanding as of September 9, 2022.
(2)
Represents the estimated fair value of approximately 54 million shares of Broadcom common stock estimated to be issued,
calculated using the per share price of Broadcom common stock as of September 9, 2022. The fair value of Broadcom common
stock to be issued consists of (i) approximately $27,939 million for the stock election shares and (ii) approximately $21 million
for the settlement of VMware stock options and director RSUs. The fair value of Broadcom common stock to be issued to settle
VMware stock options and director RSUs included in the merger consideration represents the amount attributable to pre-
combination services. As outlined in the merger agreement, each stock election share to be settled at closing will be exchanged
for 0.25200 shares of Broadcom common stock and each net option share and director RSU to be settled at closing will be
exchanged for 0.12600 shares of Broadcom common stock. The calculation of preliminary merger consideration is based on
424,467,467 shares of VMware common stock outstanding as of September 9, 2022.
(3)
Represents the estimated fair value of VMware restricted stock unit awards (other than director RSUs) and performance stock
unit awards attributable to pre-combination services. As outlined in the merger agreement, each outstanding VMware restricted
stock unit award (other than director RSUs) and each outstanding VMware performance stock unit award will be assumed by
Broadcom and converted into a number of restricted stock units denominated in shares of Broadcom common stock. Broadcom
estimates that approximately 7 million Broadcom restricted stock unit awards with an estimated fair value of $3,506 million will
be issued in connection with the transactions, and $340 million is attributable to pre-combination services.
(4)
Represents estimated pay-off amount for the repayment of VMware’s senior unsecured term loan facility.
134
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The actual value of Broadcom common stock to be issued will depend on the per share price of Broadcom common
stock at the closing date of the transactions, and therefore, the actual merger consideration will fluctuate with the
market price of Broadcom common stock until the transactions are consummated. The following table shows the
effect of changes in Broadcom’s stock price and the resulting impact on the estimated merger consideration and
estimated goodwill: 
Change in Stock Price

$57,735
$44,713
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
Under the acquisition method of accounting, VMware’s identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by
Broadcom will be recorded at the acquisition date fair values and added to those of Broadcom. The pro forma
adjustments are preliminary and based on estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed and are prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the transactions. The final determination of
the purchase price allocation will be completed as soon as practicable after the completion of the transactions and
will be based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing date. The final
amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed could differ significantly from the amounts presented in
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price
allocation is subject to further adjustment as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses and
final valuations are completed. There can be no assurances that these additional analyses and final valuations will
not result in material changes to the estimates of fair value set forth below.
The following table sets forth a preliminary allocation of the estimated merger consideration to VMware’s identifiable
tangible and intangible assets expected to be acquired and liabilities expected to be assumed by Broadcom, as if the
transactions had been completed on July 31, 2022, based on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of
VMware as of July 29, 2022, with the excess recorded as goodwill:

Goodwill represents the excess of the preliminary estimated merger consideration over the estimated fair value of the
underlying net assets acquired. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be reviewed for impairment at least
annually, absent any indicators of impairment. Goodwill is attributable to planned growth in new markets, and
synergies expected to be achieved from the combined operations of Broadcom and VMware. Goodwill recognized in
the transactions is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Transaction Accounting Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet
(a)
Represents the total merger consideration of $60,565 million, consisting of (i) cash consideration of $30,243
million for cash election shares, (ii) cash consideration of $22 million for the pre-combination portion of
VMware stock options and director RSUs, (iii) repayment of the outstanding principal balance of $2,000
million under VMware’s senior unsecured term loan facility by Broadcom, (iv) issuance of approximately 54
million shares of Broadcom common stock with an estimated fair value of $27,960 million, and (v) issuance
of approximately 7 million Broadcom restricted stock unit awards with an estimated fair value of $340 million
attributable to pre-combination services. The calculation of preliminary merger consideration is based on
424,467,467 shares of VMware common stock outstanding as of September 9, 2022.
(b)
Reflects the adjustment to cash and cash equivalents and Broadcom’s retained earnings to record the
estimated transaction costs to be incurred by Broadcom in connection with the transactions.
(c)
Reflects the adjustment to cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, other current liabilities and
VMware’s accumulated deficit to record the estimated transaction costs to be incurred and the settlement
of transaction costs that have been already accrued for as of July 29, 2022 by VMware in connection with
the transactions. 
(d)
Reflects the reclassifications of the related party balances of VMware with Dell since VMware and Dell will
no longer be considered related parties as a result of the transactions.
(e)
Reflects the elimination of VMware’s historical deferred commission balances as these balances are
considered in the fair value measurement of any customer relationships.
(f)
Represents the net adjustment to the estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment, and the
adjustment to the right-of-use assets (referred to as ROU) and lease liabilities of VMware. Preliminary
property, plant and equipment fair values, and the revised value of the ROU assets related to finance
leases, in the pro forma financial information are provided in the table below. The depreciation expense
related to these assets, except the ROU assets related to finance leases, is reflected as a pro forma
adjustment in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, as further described
in Note 5(b). The net adjustment to the ROU assets related to operating leases is reflected in other long-
term assets. VMware's acquired ROU assets and lease liabilities are measured and recognized based on
remaining future lease payments using Broadcom’s incremental borrowing rates. Due to the immateriality of
the adjustment, no adjustments are recorded in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements
of operations related to the lease adjustment.

(n)
Represents the adjustment to Broadcom’s cash and cash equivalents, common stock, additional paid-in
capital and retained earnings to record the stock-based compensation expense associated with the post-
combination portion of acquisition date fair value of the settlement amount for VMware’s stock options and
director RSUs. Because VMware’s outstanding stock options and director RSUs will be settled at closing
and require no further service, the entire post-combination portion of such awards is recognized as
compensation expense immediately after the closing of the transactions.
(o)
Represents the adjustment to the deferred tax asset and the deferred tax liability balances associated with
the incremental differences in the book and tax basis created from the preliminary purchase price allocation,
primarily resulting from the preliminary fair value of intangible assets. The total adjustment of $8.5 billion is
reflected as the netting of the historical VMware deferred tax asset balance of $6.0 billion against the
deferred tax liability, and an additional $2.5 billion adjustment made to the deferred tax liability. In addition,
$426 million of Broadcom’s historical deferred tax asset balance is reclassified to the deferred tax liability to
appropriately reflect the net deferred tax liability balance of Broadcom after the transactions. Deferred taxes
are established based on a blended statutory tax rate based on jurisdictions where income is generated.
The effective tax rate of Broadcom following the transactions could be significantly different (either higher
or lower) depending on post-acquisition activities, including the geographical mix of income. This
determination is preliminary and subject to change based upon the final determination of the closing date
fair value, primarily of the identifiable intangible assets.

Transaction Accounting Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations
(a)
Represents the adjustment to record elimination of historical amortization expense and recognition of new
amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets based on the estimated fair value as of July 31,
2022. Amortization expense is calculated based on the estimated fair value of each of the identifiable
intangible assets and the associated estimated useful lives as discussed in Note 4(i) above, and is allocated
between amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets - cost of revenue (referred to as ACoR) and
amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets - operating expenses (referred to as AOE) based on the
nature of activities associated with the intangible assets acquired.
The adjustment for the amortization expense is as follows:

associated economic benefits are expected to be derived. Therefore, the amount of amortization following
the transactions may differ significantly between periods based upon the final value assigned and
amortization methodology used for each identifiable intangible asset.

(b)
Represents the adjustment to record elimination of historical depreciation expense and recognition of new
depreciation expense based on the estimated fair value as of July 31, 2022. The depreciation of property,
plant and equipment is calculated based on the estimated fair value of each asset and the associated
remaining useful lives as discussed in Note 4(f) above. Depreciation expense is allocated among CoSS,
research and development (referred to as R&D), and SG&A based upon the nature of activities associated
with the use of the property, plant and equipment.

(c)
Represents the adjustment to record the elimination of historical VMware stock-based compensation
expense and recognition of new stock-based compensation expense for the post-combination portion of
VMware’s stock options, restricted stock unit awards and performance stock unit awards. As discussed in
adjustment 4(n) above, because VMware’s outstanding stock options and director RSUs will be settled and
require no further service, the entire post-combination portion of such awards is recognized as a
compensation expense immediately after the closing of the transactions. This is a non-recurring adjustment.
The income tax benefit resulting from this adjustment is $0.5 million using Broadcom’s statutory tax rate of
18%.
VMware’s performance stock unit awards and restricted stock unit awards (other than director RSUs) are
assumed and converted into approximately 7 million Broadcom restricted stock unit awards with an
estimated fair value of $3,506 million, of which $3,166 million is attributable to post-combination services
and will be recognized as compensation expense. Broadcom restricted stock unit awards will be subject to
the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding VMware equity awards, including vesting
terms. Therefore, the post-combination portion of Broadcom restricted stock unit awards will be recognized
as stock-based compensation expense ratably over the remaining vesting period. With respect to any
Broadcom restricted stock unit award that replaces a VMware performance stock unit award, vesting will no
longer be subject to the achievement of performance goals or metrics and will solely be based on providing
continued services to Broadcom and its affiliates, including VMware, through the end of the applicable
performance period.
The following table reflects the elimination of VMware’s historical stock-based compensation expense and
the recognition of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of Broadcom restricted stock
unit awards. Stock-based compensation expense is allocated among CoSS, R&D and SG&A based upon
the nature of activities associated.

Represents the income tax benefit resulting from the aggregate increase in expenses due to the transaction
accounting adjustments described herein. As a result of the corresponding decrease in income before
income taxes in the statements of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021 and the nine months
ended July 31, 2022, an income tax benefit is recognized for each period respectively. A blended statutory
tax rate of approximately 12% is assumed for the amortization of intangible assets, and a blended statutory
tax rate of approximately 18% is assumed for all other pro forma adjustments. The applicable blended
statutory tax rates are based on the jurisdictions in which the assets are located and are not necessarily
indicative of the effective tax rate of Broadcom following the transactions, which could be significantly
different depending on post-acquisition activities, including the geographical mix of income.
(g)
Represents the elimination of revenue recognized by VMware and selling, general and administrative
expenses recognized by Broadcom from the pre-existing relationship between the two entities.
(h)
Reflects the total estimated transaction costs for Broadcom and VMware that have not yet been recognized
in the statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2021. Transaction costs are expensed as
incurred and reflected as if incurred on November 2, 2020, the date the transactions are assumed to have
been completed for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of
operations. This is a non-recurring item. The income tax benefit resulting from this adjustment is $76 million
using Broadcom’s statutory tax rate of 18%.

Financing Adjustments
(a)
Reflects the $32.0 billion of new debt to be issued by Broadcom as described in the Financing section
above, net of capitalized costs. As noted in the Financing section above, Broadcom expects to issue one or
more series of senior unsecured debt securities and/or other incurrences of indebtedness prior to closing of
the transactions. Therefore, the bridge facility is not expected to be utilized. However, as the terms of the
bridge facility are the best available information, the financing adjustments are calculated based on the
terms of the bridge facility. The new debt is classified as current debt based on the bridge facility’s term of
364 days. 
(b)
To record estimated interest expense, including the amortization of capitalized costs, related to the
adjustment in Note 6(a) above. The bridge facility is assumed to be outstanding for the entire year ended
October 31, 2021 and the nine months ended July 31, 2022. The interest rate assumed for purposes of
preparing this pro forma financial information is 4.004%, which represents the 1-month Term SOFR
reference rate published by the CME term SOFR administrator as of September 9, 2022, plus 1.225%. In
addition to the interest expense, the adjustments also include adjustments to additional fees.

Number of Directors
The Broadcom board of directors will
consist of not fewer than one nor more
than thirteen members, the exact number
of which will be fixed from time to time by
resolution adopted by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the Broadcom board of
directors then in office. The Broadcom
bylaws provide that no reduction of the
authorized number of directors will have
the effect of removing any director before
that director’s term of office expires. At
present, Broadcom has nine directors.
The VMware board of directors will
consist of not less than six nor more than
twelve members. Subject to the limitations
of the foregoing sentence and the rights
of the holders of any series of preferred
stock to elect directors under specified
circumstances, the number of directors of
the VMware board of directors will be
fixed, and may be increased or decreased
from time to time, exclusively by a
resolution adopted by an affirmative vote
of a majority of the entire VMware board
of directors which VMware would have if
there were no vacancies at the time such
resolution is adopted. No decrease in the
number of directors may shorten the term
of any incumbent director. At present,
VMware has ten directors.
Election of Directors
Each director is elected by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast with
respect to such director by the shares
represented and entitled to vote therefor
at a meeting of the stockholders for the
election of directors at which a quorum is
present. “Majority of votes cast” means

of votes cast “against” that director (with
“abstentions” and “broker non-votes”
not counted as votes cast as either “for”
or “against” such director’s election). In
the event of a contested election of
directors, directors are elected by the vote
of a plurality of the votes cast by the
shares represented and entitled to vote at
such meeting with respect to the election
of such directors. 
 
If an incumbent director who is nominated
for an election other than a contested

Term of Office
Each director will hold office until the next
annual election and until his or her
successor is duly elected and qualified, or
until his or her earlier death, resignation or
removal.
The VMware charter provides that the
VMware board of directors be divided
into three classes: Class I, Class II and
Class III. Each class will consist, as nearly
as may be possible, of one-third of the
total number of directors constituting the
VMware board of directors. At each
annual meeting of VMware stockholders
following November 1, 2021, successors
to the members of the class of directors
having a term expiring at such annual
meeting will be elected for a three-year
term.
Removal of Directors
Directors may be removed, with or
without cause, at any time by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the voting power of the then-
outstanding shares of Broadcom capital
stock entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors, voting together as a
single class.
Any director may be removed from office
only for cause and only by the affirmative
vote of holders of at least a majority of
the votes entitled to be cast to elect any
such director.
Filling Vacancies on the
Board
Vacancies and newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the
authorized number of directors may be
filled only by a majority of the directors
then in office, although less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
Any director appointed in accordance
with the preceding sentence will hold
office for the remainder of the term to
which the director is appointed and until
such director’s successor has been
elected and qualified. A vacancy in the
Broadcom board of directors is deemed to
exist in the case of the death, removal or
resignation of any director,
Any vacancy on the VMware board of
directors that results from an increase in
the number of directors may be filled by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the
VMware board of directors then in office,
provided that a quorum is present, and
any other vacancy occurring on the
VMware board of directors may be filled
by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
VMware board of directors then in office,
even if less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director. Any director of any
class elected to fill a vacancy resulting
from an increase in the number

unless the size of the Broadcom board of
directors is reduced by the remaining
directors.
of directors of such class will hold office
for a term that coincides with the
remaining term of that class. Any director

an increase in the number of directors will
have the same remaining term as that of
his or her predecessor.

addition to the foregoing provision, the
VMware charter will provide that officers
will not be liable to VMware or its
stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as officers,
except to the extent such exemption from
liability or limitation thereof is not
permitted under the DGCL. Consequently,
officers would not be personally liable to

damages for breach of fiduciary duty,

General. Holders of VMware common stock will become holders of Holdco common stock as a result of the first
merger. Holders of VMware common stock will not have appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection
with the first merger. The holders of Holdco common stock will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL in connection with the second merger.
If you hold one or more shares of VMware common stock, you are entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law and
have the right to have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive the “fair value” of such
shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) as of
completion of the second merger in place of the merger consideration, as determined by the court, if you strictly
comply with the procedures specified in Section 262 of the DGCL. Any such VMware stockholder awarded “fair
value” for its, his or her shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in cash, together with interest, if
any, in lieu of the right to receive the merger consideration.
The following discussion is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex F. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder
of the shares of VMware common stock. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor
does it constitute a recommendation that you exercise your rights to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, when a merger is submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders as in the case
of approval of the merger agreement proposal, VMware, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each
stockholder who was a VMware stockholder on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available, that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262
of the DGCL. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes the required notice, and the copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex F. A holder of VMware common stock who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve the right to do so should review the following discussion and
Annex F carefully and consult with legal advisors. Failure to strictly comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the
DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who
loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration.
How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights. VMware stockholders wishing to exercise the rights to seek an
appraisal of their shares must do ALL of the following:
•
you must not vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement proposal. Because a proxy that is signed
and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of
approval of the merger agreement proposal, if you submit a proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal
rights, you must instruct the proxy to vote your shares against approval of the merger agreement proposal
or abstain from voting your shares on the approval of the merger agreement proposal;
•
you must deliver to VMware a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the approval of the merger
agreement proposal at the special meeting and be a stockholder of record at the time of the making of such
demand;
•
you must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of
the second merger; and
•
you or the surviving company in the third merger (or any other stockholder that has properly demanded
appraisal rights and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights) must file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective time
of the second merger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the
VMware stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of
VMware common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
160TABLE OF CONTENTS
Voting, virtually or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the approval of the merger
agreement proposal will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The
written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote.
Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of
record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it appears on the stock
certificates (or in the stock ledger). The demand must reasonably inform VMware of the identity of the stockholder
and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its common stock. Non-record owners may not
directly make appraisal demands to VMware. The non-record owner must, in such cases, have the owner of record,
such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of
common stock. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of VMware
common stock as a nominee for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of VMware common
stock held for one or more non-record owners, while not exercising this right for other non-record owners. In that
case, the written demand should state the number of shares of VMware common stock as to which appraisal is
sought. Where no number of shares of VMware common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed
to cover all shares of VMware common stock held in the name of the record owner.
IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND
YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE
FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE
BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE
SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER
PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO
CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS
NECESSARY TO PERFECT YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
If you own shares of VMware common stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy
in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent,
including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record;
however, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in making the demand, such
person is acting as agent for the record owner. If you hold shares of VMware common stock through a broker who in
turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of
such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as
record holder.
If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand,
executed as set forth above, to:
VMWARE, INC. 
3401 Hillview Ave
Palo Alto, California 94304
(650) 427-5000
Attention: Office of the Secretary
Actions After Completion of the second merger. If the second merger is consummated, the surviving company in the
third merger will give written notice that the second merger has become effective within 10 days after the effective
time of the second merger to each stockholder that did not vote in favor of the merger agreement and delivered a
written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the
effective time of the second merger, any stockholder that did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such a
proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such demand and to accept the merger consideration in
accordance with the merger agreement for his, her or its shares of common stock. Within 120 days after the effective
time of the second merger, but not later, any stockholder that has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of
the DGCL, or the surviving company in the third merger may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in
the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving company in the third merger in the case of a
petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the value of the shares of VMware common stock held
by all such stockholders. The surviving company in the third merger is under no obligation to file an appraisal
petition and has no intention of doing so.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you desire to have your shares appraised and have otherwise complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods
and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the second merger, any stockholder that has complied with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving company in the third merger, upon written
request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the approval of the merger
agreement proposal and with respect to which VMware has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate
number of holders of those shares. The surviving company in the third merger must mail this statement within the
later of 10 days of receipt by the surviving company in the third merger of the request therefor or 10 days after
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the non-record owner of shares of stock held
in a voting trust or by a nominee on your behalf, you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from
the surviving company in the third merger the statement described in this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving company in the third
merger, the surviving company in the third merger will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a
copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Register in Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then
determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders demanding appraisal
who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any
stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. Where proceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal
is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of VMware common stock
owned by such stockholders in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules
specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value
of the shares of VMware common stock at the effective time of the second merger held by all stockholders who have
properly perfected appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the second merger. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, interest from the effective time of the second merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the second merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of
such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same, upon surrender by such
stockholders of their stock certificates or, in the case of book-entry shares, forthwith.
In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining
fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that
“[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware
Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset
value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained
as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the
DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such
exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only
to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware
Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,
may be considered.” An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under
Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater
than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration. Broadcom and the surviving company in the
third merger do
162
TABLE OF CONTENTS
not anticipate offering more than the merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserve
the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of
VMware common stock is less than the merger consideration.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective time of the second merger, then all
stockholders will lose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the merger consideration described in the
merger agreement, without interest thereon.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may tax those costs
against the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems to be equitable under the circumstances. However,
costs do not include attorneys and expert witness fees. Each stockholder is responsible for its own attorneys and
expert witnesses expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order
all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares
entitled to appraisal.
Any stockholder that has duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the
effective time of the second merger, be entitled to vote the VMware shares subject to that demand for any purpose or
receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to
holders of record of VMware shares as of a record date prior to the effective time of the second merger.
Any stockholder that has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party may
withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the
demand for appraisal to the surviving corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after
the effective time of the second merger will require written approval of the surviving company in the third merger. No
appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval
of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just, provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the second merger within 60 days after the effective time of
the second merger. If you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw or lose the appraisal right, your shares will be
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest thereon.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of
appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration for your shares in accordance
with the merger agreement. In view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a
VMware stockholder and are considering exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you should consult your
own legal advisor.
THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE
WITH TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD
CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION
262 OF THE DGCL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FOREGOING
SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.

If the merger agreement is adopted and the transactions are completed, VMware will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Broadcom, and, consequently, there will be no annual meeting of VMware stockholders in 2023 or
thereafter. If the merger agreement is not adopted or the transactions are not completed for any reason, VMware will
hold an annual meeting of its stockholders in 2023.
To be eligible for inclusion in VMware’s proxy statement for the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholder
proposals must be received at VMware’s principal executive offices no later than January 27, 2023. Any stockholder
who wishes to bring a proposal or nominate a person for election to the VMware board of directors at the 2023 annual
meeting must provide written notice of the proposal or nomination to the attention of VMware’s Secretary, Legal
Department, on or after March 14, 2023 and no later than April 13, 2023. In addition to satisfying the foregoing
requirements under VMware’s bylaws, to comply with the universal proxy rules under the Exchange Act,
stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than VMware’s nominees must
provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than May 15,
2023. Stockholder proposals should be addressed to: VMware, Inc. Legal Department, 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo
Alto, California 94304.
Stockholders are also advised to review VMware’s bylaws, which contain additional requirements about advance
notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations. A copy of the full text of the bylaw provisions discussed
above may be obtained from the Governance subsection of the Investor Relations page of VMware’s website at

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements
for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by
delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. As permitted by
the Exchange Act, only one copy of this proxy statement/prospectus is being delivered to stockholders residing at
the same address, unless stockholders have notified VMware whose shares they hold of their desire to receive
multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,”
potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Two or more stockholders sharing an address can request delivery of a single copy of VMware’s annual disclosure
documents and this proxy statement/prospectus if they are receiving multiple copies by calling Broadridge Financial
Solutions, Inc. at (866) 540-7095 or writing to them at Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Householding Department,
51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. In the same way, two or more stockholders sharing an address and
receiving only a single copy of VMware’s annual disclosure documents and this proxy statement/prospectus can

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”), dated as of May 26, 2022, is by and among Broadcom Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“Parent”), VMware, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Verona Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (“Holdco”), Verona Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Holdco

provided by Section 262, then such Proposed Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to be Cash Election Shares for all purposes of

Consideration and shall be treated as Cash Election Shares. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for fair market value of any shares of Company Common Stock, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to DGCL 262 and any alleged dissenter’s rights, and
Parent shall have the opportunity, at Parent’s expense, to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Closing Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.
(c) Certain Adjustments. If prior to the Closing Effective Time, Parent, Holdco or the Company, as the case may be, should split, subdivide,
consolidate, combine or otherwise reclassify Parent Common Stock, Holdco Common Stock or Company Common Stock, or pay a stock
dividend or other stock distribution in Parent Common Stock, Holdco Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as applicable, or
otherwise change Parent Common Stock, Holdco Common Stock or Company Common Stock into any other securities, or make any other
such stock dividend or distribution in capital stock of Parent, Holdco or the Company in respect of Parent Common Stock, Holdco Common
Stock or Company Common Stock, respectively, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the price of Parent
Common Stock, Holdco Common Stock or Company Common Stock or the number or fraction of shares of Parent Common Stock, Holdco
Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to proportionately reflect such split,
combination, dividend or other distribution or change; provided that nothing in this Section 3.3(c) shall be construed to permit Parent, Holdco
or the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
(d) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Second Merger and no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon the conversion of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(i), and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any

interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the last reported sale price of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ (as reported in
the Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the Company) on the last
complete trading day prior to the date of the Closing Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Closing Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the “Fractional Share Cash Amount”). No such
holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that would
otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration.

entitled to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(i) shall be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares and
any Excluded Shares) (the “Maximum Cash Share Number”), and the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be entitled
to receive the Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(i) shall be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares and any
Excluded Shares).
(ii) Promptly (and in any event no later than five business days) after the Closing Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration as follows:
(A) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made
(which, for this purpose (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 3.3(b)), shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares
determined as of the Closing Effective Time) (the “Cash Election Number”) equals or exceeds the Maximum Cash Share Number,
then (x) all Stock Election Shares and Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and
(y) Cash Election Shares of each holder will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such
holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Maximum Cash Share Number and the denominator of which is the Cash
Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 3.3(a)(i), whether fractions of Cash Election
Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder’s Cash Election Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration; and
(B) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Maximum Cash Share Number (the amount by which the Maximum Cash Share
Number exceeds the Cash Election Number being referred to herein as the “Shortfall Number”), then all Cash Election Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:
1) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 3.3(a)(i), whether fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded
up or down), with the remaining number of such holder’s Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration; or
2) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right
to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is
the total number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 3.3(a)(i), whether
fractions of Stock Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder’s Stock Election
Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.
A-16TABLE OF CONTENTS
(b) Election Procedures. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, Section 3.3 and this Section 3.4 (a “Holder”) shall have the right, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article III, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:
(i) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.4(b) (herein called an “Election”) (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock
Election and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires
to make a Cash Election.
(ii) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in
such form as prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Form of Election”), so as to permit Holders to
exercise their right to make an Election.
(iii) Parent and the Company (A) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election not less than 20 business days prior to the
anticipated Election Deadline to Holders of record as of the fifth business day prior to such mailing date, and (B) following such mailing
date, shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder who requests such
Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline. The time period between such mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to
herein as the “Election Period.”
(iv) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form of
Election properly completed and executed (including duly executed transmittal materials included in the Form of Election) and
accompanied by any Certificates representing all certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate
customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by
the Parties, “Election Deadline” means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located)
on the date that is five business days prior to Parent’s good faith estimate of the Closing Date or such other date as may be mutually
agreed to by the Parties. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them
announcing the date of the Election Deadline at least three business days prior to the Election Deadline.
(v) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke his, her or its Election by written notice to the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and executed revised Form of Election. If any Election is
not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock (none of Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent being
under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is
thereafter timely made.
(vi) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his, her or its Election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his, her or its Certificates, or of the guarantee of
delivery of such Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon
receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from the Parties that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with the
terms hereof.
(vii) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion,
shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the
Forms of Election and compliance by any Holder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (B) the method of issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Second Merger and (C) the method of
payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.
(c) Appointment of Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Second Merger
(the “Exchange Agent”) and shall enter into an agreement relating to the Exchange Agent’s responsibilities under this Agreement.
(d) Deposit of Merger Consideration. Prior to or at the Closing Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in the Second
Merger and the Fractional Share Cash Amount (to the extent determinable) as is necessary for the payment to holders of Company Common
Stock and shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration payable in the Second
Merger to holders of Company Common Stock (such cash and book-entry shares, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, the “Exchange Fund”); provided that no such deposits shall be required to be made with respect to any Dissenting Shares. In the
event that the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient (other than as a result of payment of the Cash Consideration in
accordance with this Agreement) to pay the aggregate amount of all Cash Consideration and Fractional Share Cash Amounts (including as a
result of any investment of the Exchange Fund), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
A-17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the shortfall that is the amount required to make such payment.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Cash Consideration and Fractional Share
Cash Amounts out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is
not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash included in the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of the Exchange Fund shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1
or A-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $50 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article III. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent.
(e) Exchange Procedures. Promptly (and within five business days) after the Closing Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of Certificates whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(i) into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree upon (the “Letter of Transmittal”) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates become entitled in
accordance with Section 3.4(g). Holders of Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to
Section 3.3(a)(i) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration.
(f) Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with the Letter of Transmittal in the case of
holders of Certificates, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required by the Exchange Agent, or any similar information from the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, such holder shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any
dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 3.4(g). Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose, to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.
Any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 3.4(g) shall
become payable in accordance with Section 3.4(g). In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon,
due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock shall be paid or issued,
as the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent and
Parent that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.4(k)) or in respect of any
Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Closing Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III, together
with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with Section 3.4(g).
(g) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Closing Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of Company Common Stock to be converted into
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(i) until such holder shall surrender such share in accordance with this Section 3.4.
After the surrender in accordance with this Section 3.4 of a share of Company Common Stock to be converted into Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(i), Parent shall cause the holder thereof to be paid, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Closing Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Closing Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. After the Closing Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company
to pay on the applicable payment date the amount of dividends or other distributions on shares of Company Common Stock that have a
record date prior to the Closing Effective Time and a payment date after the Closing Effective Time, such payment to be made to the holders
of Company Common Stock on such record date.
(h) No Further Ownership Rights. The shares of Parent Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this Section
3.4(h) in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (subject to DGCL 262). From and after the Closing
A-18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Effective Time (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 3.4(f) (together
with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with Section 3.4(g)), without interest and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time. From and after the Closing Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time. If, after the Closing Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.
(i) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto)
that remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the Closing
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this
Section 3.4(i) shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof,
for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to this Section 3.4(i) without any interest thereon.
(j) No Liability. None of the Parties or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund or
the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official if required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in
accordance with this Section 3.4(j) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the
date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.
(k) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, providing an indemnity in such
amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it,
Verona Surviving LLC or Verona Converted LLC with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of
the Exchange Fund and subject to Section 3.4(i), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration and any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
(l) Allocation; Tax Treatment. For all purposes of this Article III and for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), it is intended that a Holder will be treated as having surrendered, in exchange for the Cash
Consideration to be paid to such Holder pursuant to this Article III, a number of shares of Company Common Stock (which are specifically
identified by such Holder in the Letter of Transmittal to be the shares exchanged for such Holder’s Cash Consideration) equal to the product
of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such Holder and converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and (B) the Cash Ratio.",202,205

(a) Each of the Company and Holdco shall take all actions as may be necessary so that at the Initial Effective Time, each Company Equity
Award shall automatically be converted into an equity award covering that number of shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Equity Award. All terms and conditions applicable to each such Company
Equity Award immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time shall, except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, remain in
effect immediately after the Initial Effective Time. Holdco shall remain subject to the obligations of the Company with respect to any such
Company Equity Awards immediately after the Initial Effective Time.
(b) At the Closing Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall automatically be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive within five
business days, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time, the Equity Award Consideration, without interest and less applicable
withholding Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, “Net Option Share” means, with respect to a Company Option, the quotient obtained
by dividing (i) the product of (A) the excess (if any) of the Equity Award Consideration Value over the per share exercise price applicable to
the Company Option multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time by (ii) the Equity Award Consideration Value. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company
Option that has an exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Equity Award Consideration Value shall be cancelled at the Closing
Effective Time for no consideration.
(c) At the Closing Effective Time, each Company RSU Award held by a non-employee member of the Company’s Board of Directors (each,
a “Director Award”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time, whether vested or
A-19TABLE OF CONTENTS
unvested, shall automatically be cancelled, with the holder of such Director Award becoming entitled to receive within five business days
following the Closing Effective Time, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, in respect of each share of Holdco
Common Stock subject to the Director Award immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time, the Equity Award Consideration, without
interest and less applicable withholding Taxes; provided that with respect to any Director Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that is not permitted to be treated in accordance with this Section 3.5(c) at the
Closing Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such Director Award shall be treated in
accordance with Section 3.5(d).
(d) At the Closing Effective Time, each Company RSU Award (other than any Director Award) and each Company PSU Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time shall automatically be assumed and converted into a restricted stock unit award
with respect to a number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an “Adjusted RSU Award”)
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Holdco Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award,
as applicable as of immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time and (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.
(i) For purposes of this Section 3.5(d), the number of shares of Holdco Common Stock subject to a Company PSU Award immediately
prior to the Closing Effective Time shall be determined based on (A) with respect to each Company PSU Award granted pursuant to an
“Operating PSU Plan,” either (1) for each performance period that has been completed prior to the Closing Effective Time, the actual
level of performance as certified in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the terms of the applicable award agreement by
the compensation committee of the Company Board of Directors or (2) with respect to each performance period that has not been
completed prior to the Closing Effective Time, the target level of performance and (B) with respect to each Company PSU Award
granted pursuant to a “TSR PSU Plan,” the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals through the second to last
trading day immediately preceding the Closing Effective Time, with such level calculated by deeming the applicable ending price per
share of Company Common Stock to be equal to the Equity Award Consideration Value.
(ii) Subject to applicable Law, each Adjusted RSU Award shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the
corresponding Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award, as applicable, under the applicable Company Equity Plan and the
agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting terms, except as set forth in the remainder of this Section 3.5(d). With
respect to any Adjusted RSU Award that replaces a Company PSU Award, vesting shall no longer be subject to achievement of any
performance goals or metrics and shall thereafter be based solely on providing continued services to Parent, the Company, or their
respective affiliates through the period of time set forth in the award agreement relating to the Company PSU Award if the award
provided for service-based vesting after achievement of any performance conditions, or, if no service-based vesting was required
following the end of the applicable performance period, through the end of the applicable performance period.
(e) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company, the Company Board of Directors or the compensation committee thereof,
as applicable, shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide that: (i) with respect to any offering
period in effect as of the date hereof (the “Current ESPP Offering Period”), no employee who is not a participant in the Company ESPP as
of the date hereof may become a participant in the Company ESPP and no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her
payroll deduction election from that in effect on the date hereof such for Current ESPP Offering Period; (ii) subject to the consummation of
the Second Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Closing Effective Time; (iii) if the Current ESPP
Offering Period terminates before five business days prior to the Election Deadline, then the Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new
offering period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement; and (iv) if any Current ESPP
Offering Period is still in effect at five business days prior to the Election Deadline, then the final exercise date under the Company ESPP
shall be accelerated to such date. Each Company ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under the Company ESPP shall be used to
purchase Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP as of the final exercise date, which Company
Common Stock shall be treated in accordance with Section 3.1 and as promptly as practicable following the purchase of Company Common
Stock in accordance with this sentence, the Company shall return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s
account after such purchase.
(f) Prior to the Closing Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors or the compensation committee thereof, as applicable, and the
Holdco Board of Directors shall pass resolutions as are necessary to authorize and approve the treatment of the Company Equity Awards
and the Company ESPP as contemplated by this Section 3.5.
(g) Unless Parent may rely on an existing registration statement on Form S-8, Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than five business days
after the Closing Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), to the extent such form is available, relating to
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Adjusted RSU Awards. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or statements for so long as the Adjusted RSU Awards remain outstanding.

date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, the Company agrees that it shall not, and the Company

Agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 6.3) (a “Company Acquisition Agreement”) or (viii) commit or agree to do any of the
foregoing (any act described in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) (to the extent related to the foregoing clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or
(vii)), a “Change of Recommendation”). The Company shall, and the Company shall cause the Company’s Subsidiaries to, and the Company
shall cause its and their other respective Representatives to, immediately following the No-Shop Period Start Date cease any and all existing
solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any Persons (or provision of any nonpublic information to any Persons) with respect to any
inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Promptly following the No-
Shop Period Start Date (and in any event within three business days following the No-Shop Period Start Date), the Company shall (A)
request in writing that each Person (other than Parent) that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of
an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal within three years prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date promptly destroy or
return to the Company all nonpublic information furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to such Person or any of its
Representatives in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement, and (B) terminate access to any physical or electronic data
rooms relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal by any such Person and its Representatives. From and after the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the Company shall enforce, and not waive, terminate or modify without Parent’s prior written consent, any confidentiality, standstill
or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other agreement; provided that, if the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular standstill provision, or other
provision with similar effect, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent but with written notice to Parent, waive such standstill provision, or other
provision with similar effect, solely to the extent necessary to permit the applicable Person (if it has not been solicited in breach of this
Section 6.3(b)) to make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board of Directors, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such Person
agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent, in each case as contemplated by this Section 6.3. For purposes of this Section
6.3, the term “Person” means any Person or “group,” as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the
Company, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 6.3 by the Company Board of Directors (including any committee thereof), by any of the Company’s officers, by any
of the Company’s Subsidiaries or by any of their respective Representatives shall be a breach of this Section 6.3 by the Company. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any notices required to be made to Parent
pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation so long as such notices are
delivered privately to Parent, except if any such notice would constitute a Change of Recommendation pursuant to the definition thereof.
(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.3(b), if from and following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach (other
than a de minimis and unintentional breach) of Section 6.3(b), (x) the Company and such Representatives may contact the third party making
such Acquisition Proposal solely to inform such Person of the existence of the provisions in this Section 6.3 or (y) if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial

advisors constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may take the
following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information with respect to the Company to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives (and its debt financing sources)), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such nonpublic information, the Company receives
from such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and the Company also provides Parent, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time such information is provided or made available to such Person or its Representatives, any non-public information
furnished to such other Person or its Representatives that was not previously furnished to Parent, and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person (and its Representatives (and its financing sources)) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.
(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent of any receipt by any director or officer of the Company
or by any of the Company’s Subsidiaries, or its or their respective Representatives, of any Acquisition Proposal or any proposals or
inquiries that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person who has made or could reasonably be expected to make an Acquisition Proposal;
provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, between the date hereof and the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall only be
required to notify Parent of any receipt by any director or officer of the Company or by any of the Company’s Subsidiaries, or its or their
respective Representatives, of any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request, and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature of the information requested
pursuant to such inquiry or request, including unredacted copies of all written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements
received by the Company relating to such Acquisition Proposal or, if such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a reasonably detailed
written description of the material terms and conditions thereof. Without limiting the Company’s other obligations under this Section 6.3, the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material terms, including any material
amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms (with any amendments or proposed amendments to economic terms being
deemed material for this purpose) of any such Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed
on a prompt and timely basis as to the nature of any information requested of the Company with respect thereto. Without limiting the
Company’s other obligations under this Section 6.3, the Company shall promptly provide (and in any event within the earlier of (i) 48 hours
and (ii) one business day) to Parent any material nonpublic information concerning the Company provided to any other Person in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours after such determination) inform Parent in writing if the Company determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.3(c). Unless this Agreement
has been validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, the Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person other than Parent or the
Parent Merger Subs from the restrictions on “business combinations” contained in any applicable Takeover Statute or in the Company
Governing Documents, or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply (other than actions consistent with actions taken in connection with
the Voting Agreements prior to the approval of any Transactions). The Company agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any
agreement with any Person which directly or indirectly prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with,
or otherwise complying with, this Section 6.3(d).
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3 to the contrary, but subject to Section 6.3(f), at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation (only of the type contemplated by
Section 6.3(b)(iv), Section 6.3(b)(vi) or Section 6.3(b)(viii) (to the extent related to Section 6.3(b)(iv) or Section 6.3(b)(vi))) in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal
counsel that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (ii) make a Change of Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 9.1(g) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach
(other than a de minimis and unintentional breach) of Section 6.3(b)), which the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors is a Superior Proposal, but only if the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless this
Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with Section 9.1(g). “Intervening Event” means any event, change or development first
occurring or arising after the date hereof that is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and was not
known by or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board of Directors as of the date hereof (or if known, the material consequences of
which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement); provided, however,
that in no event shall the following events, changes or developments constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt, existence or terms of an
Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof or (B) changes in the market price or trading volume of the
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock or any other securities of the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, or any
change in credit rating or the fact that the Company meets or exceeds internal or published estimates, projections, forecasts or predictions for
any period (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such changes may be taken into account to the
extent not otherwise excluded).

(f) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under Section 6.3(e)(i), the Company shall provide Parent with four business days’
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
therefor, and during such four business day period, the Company shall cause its Representatives (including its executive officers) to negotiate
in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a
manner that would obviate the need to effect a Change of Recommendation and at the end of such four business day period the Company
Board of Directors again makes all of the required determinations under Section 6.3(e)(i) (after in good faith taking into account any
amendments proposed by Parent) or (ii) under Section 6.3(e)(ii), the Company shall provide Parent with four business days’ prior written
notice advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the material terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of any proposed definitive documentation, and during such four business day period, the
Company shall cause its Representatives (including its executive officers) to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal and at the end of such four business day period the Company Board of Directors again makes all of the
required determinations under Section 6.3(e)(ii) (after in good faith taking into account the amendments proposed by Parent). With respect to
Section 6.3(f)(ii), if there are any material amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any
revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration the Company Stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal), the
Company shall comply again with Section 6.3(f)(ii) with references to the applicable four business day period being replaced by two
business days.
(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any “stop, look and
listen” communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or any similar
statement in response to any publicly disclosed Acquisition Proposal, (iii) making any factually accurate public statement that solely
describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the terms thereof and the identity of the person making such Acquisition
Proposal, and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto or (iv) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company, if the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel) that the failure to so
disclose would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law;
provided that, in each case, any such disclosure also includes an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.3(g) shall not permit the Company Board of Directors to make (or otherwise modify the definition of) a
Change of Recommendation except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.3(e) and Section 6.3(f).",230,233

to Parent and Parent’s Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to the
Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ offices, properties, Contracts, personnel, books and records (so long as any such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the Company’s business) and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
to, furnish as promptly as practicable to Parent all information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties, offices, Contracts
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (including information for purposes of transition and integration planning). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall not be required by this Section 7.1 to provide Parent or Parent’s Representatives with access to or to
disclose information (i) that is prohibited from being disclosed pursuant to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered
into prior to the date hereof (provided, however, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such
third party to such access or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or
disclosure not in violation of such consent requirement), (ii) the disclosure of which would be reasonably likely to violate applicable Law
(provided, however, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of such Law) or (iii) the disclosure of which would be reasonably likely to cause the loss of any attorney -client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege (provided, however, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
disclosure to the maximum extent that does not jeopardize such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege); provided,
however, that such access and information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to counsel for Parent to the extent reasonably required
for the purpose of obtaining required approvals or consents, or making filings or providing notices, subject to prior execution of a common
interest or joint defense agreement in customary form. Parent and the Company will cooperate to minimize to the extent reasonably
practicable any unnecessary disruption to the businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that may result from the requests
for access, data and information hereunder. Any access to any properties or facilities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures and shall not include the right to perform any “invasive” testing or soil, air or
groundwater sampling, including, without limitation, any Phase I or Phase II environmental assessments.

otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

executives of Parent designated by the Chief Executive Officer of Parent, (iii) one or both of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of the Company and (iv) one or two other senior executives of the Company designated by the Chief Executive Officer of the

Chief Executive Officer of Parent. Subject to applicable Law, the Integration Committee shall discuss and plan for a transition and integration
planning process concerning the combination of the operations of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries after the Closing
(the “Integration Plan”), and shall meet from time to time, as reasonably requested by the Chief Executive Officer of Parent. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 7.1(c) to the contrary and without limiting any of the obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Closing Effective Time, none of the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall
be obligated to take any action, or to refrain from taking any action, as a result of any of the discussions or meetings of the Integration
Committee or otherwise in connection with the Integration Plan or otherwise, unless such actions are contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing.
(d) In connection with the evaluation of strategic transactions involving any assets, properties or businesses of Holdco, the Company or any
Subsidiary or business of the foregoing that Parent may undertake, Parent shall be permitted to provide, with prior notice to the Company,
information about such assets, properties or businesses to potential counterparties thereof (and their Representatives) so long as (i) such
potential counterparties are subject to a customary nondisclosure agreement with Parent (to which the Company is an express third party
beneficiary) and (ii) promptly following the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent shall request in writing that
each such potential counterparty promptly destroy or return to the Company all nonpublic information of the Company furnished pursuant
to such nondisclosure agreement.",233,234

agree to, take or effect any (1) Regulatory Action (A) that would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Verona Surviving LLC, Verona Converted LLC and their
respective Subsidiaries), taken as a whole after giving effect to the Transactions, but, in each case, measured on a scale relative to the size of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, prior to the Transactions or (B) that involves or relates to any sales, divestitures or

pursuant to this Section 7.2(c); provided, further, that nothing in this Section 7.2 or otherwise in this Agreement shall require Parent or its
Subsidiaries or affiliates to commit to or effect any action or agreement that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions.

provision and that all rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged
to have occurred at or prior to the Closing Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Effective Time, now

organizational documents) or in any indemnification agreement in existence on the date of this Agreement and provided to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement shall survive the Transactions and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Verona Converted LLC on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Closing Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person intends in good faith to seek indemnification pursuant
to this Section 7.4, the provisions of this Section 7.4 shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all

earlier termination, in each case, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of

made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without
providing the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable
Party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; provided that, with respect to documents filed by a Party which are incorporated by
reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to

relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company

Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity
for the other Party (and its counsel) to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, each Party shall notify the
other promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of

shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated), or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with

provided that, if at any time following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement, either the Company or Parent reasonably determines in
good faith that the Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, including due to an
absence of quorum, then, unless the Company Board of Directors has effected a Change of Recommendation on no more than two occasions
(for each of the Company and Parent) and prior to the vote contemplated having been taken, each of the Company and Parent shall have the
right to require an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in

to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders’ Meeting by applicable Law, or (ii) the Board of Directors or any authorized committee
thereof shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or

disclosure that the Company has sent or otherwise made available to such holders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or
otherwise (including in connection with any Change of Recommendation) (in each case so long as any such information or disclosure was
made in compliance with this Agreement); provided that the Company shall be permitted to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders’ Meeting pursuant to this clause (ii) on no more than two occasions and no such adjournment or postponement shall delay the
Company Stockholders’ Meeting by more than 10 days from the prior-scheduled date or to a date on or after the fifth business day
preceding the Outside Date. Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant

disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amounts and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on

(whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity). In addition, if Parent
fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to Section 9.2(c) then (i) Parent shall reimburse the Company for all costs and
expenses (including disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amounts, and (ii) Parent shall pay to the
Company interest on the amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.2(c) from and including the date payment of such amounts was due to but
