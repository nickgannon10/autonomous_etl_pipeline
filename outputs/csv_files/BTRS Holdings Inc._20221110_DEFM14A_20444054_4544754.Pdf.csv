The merger agreement provides that, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and the applicable holder thereof,
at or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, the outstanding equity awards of Billtrust granted pursuant
to Billtrust’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, the Factor Systems, Inc. 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan or the Factor
Systems, Inc. 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (each, an “Equity Plan”) will be treated as follows:
Stock Options
With respect to each option to acquire Billtrust common stock (a “Company Stock Option”) granted pursuant
the Equity Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, (i) if the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the merger
consideration (each, an “Out-of-the-Money Option”), such Company Stock Option will terminate and be cancelled
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, without any consideration payable in respect thereof, and will
have no further force or effect and (ii) if the per share exercise price for such Company Stock Option is less than the
merger consideration (each, an “In-the-Money Option”), such Company Stock Option will become fully vested (to
the extent unvested or to the extent such Company Stock Option would not otherwise vest) and will terminate and be
cancelled immediately prior to the effective time of the merger in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash,
determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the applicable exercise price of such
canceled Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger.
Restricted Stock Units
Except as provided with below with respect to New RSUs (as defined below), each restricted stock unit granted
pursuant to an Equity Plan (a “Company RSU”) will fully vest and be canceled and converted into the right of the
holder to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration and (ii) the total number of
shares subject to such Company RSU.
Under the merger agreement, Billtrust may grant certain equity awards after September 28, 2022 and prior to the
closing of the merger. Specifically, prior to closing, Billtrust may grant (i) Company RSUs to
3TABLE OF CONTENTS
non-employee directors in accordance with the Billtrust Director Compensation Policy, (ii) off-cycle Company RSUs
to newly hired employees and in connection with employee promotions, in each case, in the ordinary course of
business, the shares underlying which cannot exceed 500,000 in the aggregate without Parent’s consent, (iii)
Company RSUs committed to be granted to September 2022 new hires, and (iv) if closing of the merger does not
occur on or before March 31, 2023, Billtrust may grant Company RSUs to employees, executive officers and non-
employee directors in the ordinary course of business (provided that any such Company RSUs awarded to the CEO
or any direct report of the CEO or any Executive Vice President or Senior Vice President of Billtrust is subject to the
consent of Parent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld). The Company RSUs granted after September
28, 2022 and prior to the closing are sometimes referred to herein as “New RSUs.” Except for such grants made to
non-employee directors, New RSUs will be converted into cash awards immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, each in an amount equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration and (ii) the total number of shares
subject to the corresponding Company RSU, which cash awards will vest and be payable in equal monthly
installments over the two-year period immediately following the closing of the transaction, subject to the grantee’s
continuous employment as of the applicable vesting date (provided that any unpaid amount will vest and be payable
in a lump sum upon the grantee’s earlier termination of employment under circumstances that entitle the grantee to
severance under Billtrust’s severance plans and policies, or would have entitled the grantee to such severance had
the termination occurred within the first year following the closing of the transaction) (such a conversion of
Company RSUs to such a cash award, the “RSU Conversion.”
All cash payments in respect of any Billtrust equity awards will be paid, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes, promptly following the effective time of the merger and in no event more than five calendar days
following the effective time of the merger.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
No new offering period will commence following September 28, 2022 under the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “ESPP”). Any contributions accumulated under the ESPP pursuant to an offering period in effect as of
September 28, 2022 will be used to purchase shares of Billtrust common stock on the earlier to the occur of (i) the last
day of the offering purchase period and (ii) ten calendar days prior to the closing of the transaction. The ESPP will
terminate immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Shares purchased under the ESPP that remain
outstanding as of the effective time will be eligible to receive the merger consideration.

4TABLE OF CONTENTS
At the meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on September 27, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to
the Billtrust board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set
forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of Billtrust’s Class 1 common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (the “Class 1 common stock”) other than shares of Class 1 common stock (i) held in treasury (other
than shares of Class 1 common stock in an Employee Plan (as defined in the merger agreement) of Billtrust), (ii)
owned by the Parent, Merger Sub and any subsidiary of either Billtrust or the Parent, (iii) held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of the merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with the DGCL or (iv) that are Rollover Shares (as defined in the merger agreement) (collectively, the
“Excluded Shares”) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan confirmed its
September 27, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Billtrust board of directors, dated September
28, 2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other
factors set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of the Class 1 common stock (other
than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated September 28, 2022, which sets forth, among other
things, the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this
proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The holders of the Class 1
common stock are urged to read the opinion in its entirety.
J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Billtrust board of directors in connection with and for the
purposes of its evaluation of the merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid in the merger to the
holders of Class 1 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) and did not address any other
aspect of the merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to the holders of any
other class of securities, holders of the Excluded Shares, creditors or other constituencies of Billtrust or as to the
underlying decision by Billtrust to engage in the merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a
fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Billtrust
as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.

The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is not subject to any financing condition.
The total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions, including payment of related fees

and related transactions through a combination of committed debt financing, committed equity investments and cash
on the Billtrust balance sheet, as described in more detail below.
In connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the EQT Investors
have delivered an equity commitment letter to Parent, dated as of September 28, 2022, pursuant to which, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, such funds have committed to capitalize Parent at or prior to the
closing of the merger in an aggregate amount of $1.24 billion in cash, in immediately available funds.
In addition, Parent has obtained debt financing commitments consisting of a $375,000,000 secured term loan
facility for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the aggregate proceeds of which, together with
the cash on hand at Parent and the equity investment, will be used to (i) consummate the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payment of the per share merger consideration and
all related fees and expenses and (ii) pay any other amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Pursuant to the terms
of the debt commitment letter, Sixth Street Partners, LLC, Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC and Monroe Capital
Management Advisors, LLC (the “debt commitment parties”) have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub,
severally, but not jointly with the debt financing in the amounts and on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the debt commitment letter, dated as of September 28, 2022 by and among the debt commitment parties (the
“debt commitment letter). The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the
debt commitment letter are subject to certain customary conditions.

The exchange of Billtrust common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state and local and other non-U.S. tax laws. Accordingly, a
6TABLE OF CONTENTS
stockholder that is a “U.S. holder” (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement) will generally recognize capital gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the merger consideration received by such U.S. holder in
the merger and (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Billtrust common stock exchanged therefor.
With respect to a stockholder that is a “non-U.S. holder” (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement), the exchange of shares of
Billtrust common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger generally will not result in U.S. federal
income tax to such non-U.S. holder unless such non-U.S. holder has certain connections with the United States.
Backup withholding may apply to the cash payment made pursuant to the merger unless the stockholder or other
payee provides a valid taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures (generally,
by providing a properly completed and executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8 or
applicable successor form). You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger” beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising
under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

The completion of the merger is conditioned on, among other things, certain specified regulatory approvals
having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect (or, in the case of certain specified regulatory approvals
that are statutory waiting periods, having expired or been terminated). Under the terms of the merger agreement, each
of Billtrust and Parent agrees to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement as soon as reasonably possible, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any
government authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary filings and obtaining certain
specified regulatory approvals.
In particular the parties agreed that obligations of Parent include (subject to certain exceptions) (i) undertaking
certain regulatory concessions if necessary, (ii) defending any action, suit or proceeding that challenges the merger
or the transaction documents and (iii) seeking to have lifted, vacated or reversed any restraint by a governmental
authority with respect to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. If requested by Parent,
Billtrust and each of its subsidiaries shall agree to any such regulatory concession. However, none of Billtrust or its
subsidiaries are required to agree to any regulatory concession that is not conditioned upon consummation of the
merger, and nothing will require Parent to accept any regulatory concessions (including, with respect to (i) any
investment fund, investment vehicle, or management or advisory entity managed by, advised by, managing, advising,
or affiliated with Parent; or (ii) any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity
industry) or other investment of any such investment fund, investment vehicle, or management or advisory entity)
other than with respect to Parent and Parent’s subsidiaries (including Merger Sub, Billtrust and its subsidiaries).
On October 13, 2022, both Billtrust and Parent filed notification of the proposed merger with the United States
Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the
“Antitrust Division”) under the HSR Act.
In addition, prior to the effective time of the merger, Billtrust and Parent are required to obtain antitrust approval
in Cyprus. On October 11, 2022, Parent filed notification of the proposed merger with the Commission for the
Protection of Competition of Cyprus and received unconditional clearance on November 8, 2022.
See the section entitled “The Merger-Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger” beginning

We expect to complete the merger in the fourth quarter of 2022. The merger is subject to various conditions,
however, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Billtrust, Parent or Merger Sub could result in the
merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special

Billtrust common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date in accordance with
applicable law and the organizational documents;
•

having expired or been terminated);
•
The other party having performed in all material respects all of its obligations under the merger agreement
contemplated to be performed by it at or prior to the effective time of the merger;
•
Subject to certain qualifications and materiality standards, the accuracy of representations and warranties

Subject to certain exceptions, Billtrust has agreed that from the date of the merger agreement until the
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, except as otherwise set forth below, Billtrust will
not, and will cause its subsidiaries’ and Billtrust’s directors and officers not to, and instruct its and its subsidiaries’
respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
Solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any “acquisition
proposal” (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitation of
Acquisition Proposals”);
•
Enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to Billtrust
or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records, work papers
and other documents related to Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with,
any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, an acquisition proposal in connection therewith, (as
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition
Proposals”);
•
Make an adverse recommendation change (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-
Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”) with regard to the merger; or
•
Enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, indication of interest, term sheet, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating to an acquisition proposal.
8TABLE OF CONTENTS
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time prior to obtaining the approval of Billtrust
stockholders, the Billtrust board of directors receives an acquisition proposal which has not resulted from a breach of
the restrictions set forth in the merger agreement that the Billtrust board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with, in the case of financial matters, its financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, (i) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as described in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”) and (ii) the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law,
then the Billtrust board of directors may provide certain information to and engage in discussions or negotiations
with a third party in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.
If the Billtrust board of directors changes its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement, Parent may
terminate the merger agreement and collect a termination fee as described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Termination Fee Payable by Billtrust and Reverse Termination Fee Payable by Parent” beginning on page
77 of this proxy statement.",19,20

Under the merger agreement, under certain circumstances and subject to certain requirements, including as
described in this section, the Billtrust board of directors is entitled to make an adverse recommendation change prior
to obtaining stockholder approval, if the Billtrust board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and, in the case of financial matters, financial advisors, that an acquisition proposal
constitutes a superior proposal, or in response to an intervening event, if the Billtrust board of directors determines
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; provided that:
•
Billtrust notifies Parent in writing at least four business days before taking such action, that Billtrust
intends to take such action, which notice specifies the reasons for the adverse recommendation change
and attaches (A) in the case of an adverse recommendation change to be made in connection with a
superior proposal or a termination of the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, the most
current version of the proposed agreement under which such superior proposal is proposed to be
consummated, or (B) in the case of an adverse recommendation change to be made pursuant to an
intervening event, a reasonably detailed description of the reasons for making such adverse
recommendation change;
•
Billtrust has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, reasonably and in good faith with
Parent during such notice period any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement that Parent proposes;
and
•
After such four business day period, (A) in the case of any adverse recommendation change to be made in
connection with a superior proposal or a termination of the merger agreement in order to accept a superior
proposal, such superior proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a superior proposal (assuming
such revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect) (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such superior proposal will require a new written
notification two business days prior from Billtrust); and (B) in the case of an adverse recommendation
change to be made pursuant to an intervening event, such intervening event would nevertheless require
such adverse recommendation change, and, in either case, the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law.
In the event that the Billtrust board of directors is permitted to change its recommendation with respect to the
merger agreement following the receipt of an acquisition proposal that it determines to be a superior proposal,
Billtrust may also terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive written agreement for such superior
proposal if concurrently with such termination, Billtrust pays to Parent the fee required to be paid to Parent as
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee Payable by Billtrust and Reverse
Termination Fee Payable by Parent” beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement.

The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the effective
time of the merger (notwithstanding any approval of the merger agreement by Billtrust stockholders):
•
by mutual written agreement of Billtrust and Parent; or
•
by either Billtrust or Parent if:

September 28, 2023 as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the
Merger Agreement” beginning on page 75 of this proxy statement) (the “end date’’); provided that the
right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party who is in breach of, or has
breached its obligations under the merger agreement, where such breach has been the proximate cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the closing to occur on or before the applicable end date;
○
any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction will have issued an order that (a) prohibits or
makes illegal consummation of the merger or (b) permanently enjoins Parent or Merger Sub from
consummating the merger, and, with respect to any order referenced in clause ​(a) or ​(b), such order will
have become final and nonappealable;
○
at the stockholder meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) at which a vote on
the adoption of the merger agreement was taken, the requisite company vote to consummate the
merger was not obtained; or
•
by Parent if:

on the part of Billtrust set forth in the merger agreement that would cause the specified closing
conditions not to be satisfied and to be incapable of being satisfied by the end date, and (A) Parent
has provided written notice of such breach and its intention to terminate the merger agreement to
Billtrust, and (B) such breach is incapable of being cured by the end date or, if capable of being cured
by the end date is not cured within thirty calendar days after receipt of written notice by Billtrust from
Parent stating Parent’s intention to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the terms set forth
therein; provided that, at the time of delivery of such notice or thereafter, Parent or Merger Sub will
not be in breach of its or their obligations under the merger agreement so as to cause any of the
specified conditions in the merger agreement not to be capable of being satisfied;
•
by Billtrust if:
○
prior to the receipt of the stockholder approval, the Billtrust board of directors authorizes Billtrust to
enter into a written agreement concerning a superior proposal, subject to compliance with the
restrictions on solicitation of acquisition proposals; provided that concurrently with such termination,
Billtrust pays to Parent the termination fee required to be paid to Parent as described in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee Payable by Billtrust and Reverse Termination Fee
Payable by Parent” beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement and enters into the alternative
acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal;
○
Parent has breached any representation or warranty or failed to perform any covenant or agreement on
the part of Parent set forth in the merger agreement that would cause the closing conditions not to be
satisfied, and to be incapable of being satisfied by the end date, or if curable prior to the end date,
Parent or Merger Sub will not have cured such breach within thirty calendar days after receipt of
written notice thereof from Billtrust of such breach; provided that, at the time at which Billtrust would
otherwise exercise such termination right, Billtrust will not be in material breach of its obligations
under the merger agreement so as to cause any of the closing conditions not to be capable of being
satisfied; or

○
(A) all of the conditions to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the merger have
been satisfied (other than those conditions which by their terms or nature can only be satisfied at the
closing, but which shall then be capable of satisfaction if the closing were to occur on such date), (B)
Billtrust has given written notice to Parent, no earlier than the date on which closing should have
occurred, that as of such time, based on the information then-available, it is ready, willing and able to
take the actions within its control to consummate the closing (including by waiving certain of any
then unsatisfied conditions) and (C) Parent has failed to consummate the closing on or prior to the

Billtrust has agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of $50,245,503.85 in immediately available funds (the
“termination fee”) if:
•
Parent terminates the merger agreement because an adverse recommendation change has occurred; or
•
Billtrust terminates the merger agreement in order for Billtrust to enter into a definitive written agreement
with respect to a superior proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions; or
•
(A) the merger agreement is terminated by Parent or Billtrust because the merger has not been
consummated by the end date or due to a failure to obtain the requisite company vote to consummate the
merger or by Parent because of an intentional breach of the non-solicitation restrictions by Billtrust, (B)
after the date of the merger agreement and prior to such termination (in the case of a termination pursuant
to a failure to consummate the merger by the end date or a breach by Billtrust) or the date of the special
meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to a failure to obtain the requisite company vote), an
acquisition proposal was publicly announced (or otherwise become publicly known) and not publicly
withdrawn and (C) within 12 months following the date of such termination. Billtrust consummates a
transaction with respect to an acquisition proposal or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an
acquisition proposal and such acquisition proposal, whether during such 12-month period or thereafter, is
subsequently consummated (provided that for purposes of this clause ​(C), each reference to “15%” in the
definition of acquisition proposal in the merger agreement is deemed to be a reference to “50%”).
In addition, Billtrust will be required to reimburse Parent for up to $5,000,000 of its costs and expenses incurred
by Parent in connection with an action or proceeding (or settlement) that results in a judgment that Billtrust must pay
the termination fee.
Parent has agreed to pay Billtrust a reverse termination fee of $100,491,007.71 in immediately available funds
upon termination of the merger agreement if the merger agreement is terminated (i) by Billtrust (a) if all of the closing
conditions have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing),
Billtrust has given written notice to Parent, no earlier than the date on which closing should have occurred, that as of
such time, based on the information then-available, it is ready, willing, and able to take the actions within its control
to consummate the closing, but Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the merger within three business days of
receipt of such notice in accordance with the merger agreement or (b) in connection with Parent or Merger Sub
breaching its representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to
not be satisfied (subject to a cure period in certain circumstances) or (ii) if either party terminates because the merger
has not been consummated by the end date, and at the time of such termination, Billtrust was otherwise entitled to
terminate the merger agreement for either of the foregoing reasons.
In addition, Parent will be required to reimburse Billtrust for (i) up to $5,000,000 of its costs and expenses
incurred by Billtrust in connection with an action or proceeding (or settlement) that results in a judgment that Parent
must pay the termination fee and (ii) up to $1,000,000 of the costs and expenses incurred by Billtrust or any of its

of the termination fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub, against Billtrust and its
subsidiaries for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform thereunder, and upon payment of such
amount, none of Billtrust or its related persons shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. However, nothing in the relevant
section of the merger agreement shall limit, abridge or otherwise modify any remedies available to Parent under the
confidentiality agreement or otherwise preclude Parent from seeking monetary damages in the event the merger
agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the termination fee is not payable.
In addition, the merger agreement provides that, if Parent fails to effect the closing when required in accordance
with the merger agreement, breaches the merger agreement or the other transaction document or fails to perform any
obligation under applicable law, then, as applicable, Billtrust’s right to specific performance or to receive the reverse
termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Billtrust pursuant to the merger agreement. In no event will
Parent be liable for any amounts in excess of the amount of the Maximum Liability Amount (as defined in the merger
agreement) including in the case of damages for fraud. In the event that the merger agreement is terminated under
circumstances in which the termination fee is payable, Parent’s right to terminate the merger agreement and receive
payment of the termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, Merger Sub, the debt financing
sources or any of their respective affiliates and any of their respective related persons pursuant to the merger
agreement.
If the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances where neither the termination fee is payable by
Billtrust nor the reverse termination fee is payable by Parent, the merger agreement will become void and of no effect
without liability of any party thereto or any related person (as defined in the merger agreement) except in the case of
fraud of such party or intentional breach by Billtrust prior to the valid termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with its terms.

breaches or threatened breaches of the merger agreement, the termination equity commitment letter and/or the equity

other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Billtrust is entitled to obtain specific performance or other equitable relief to cause Parent to effect the closing of
the merger and fund the equity financing if and only if (i) all of the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the merger (other than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the closing of
the merger, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions at the closing of the merger) have been satisfied or
waived in writing by Parent, (ii) the proceeds of the debt financing have been received in full by Parent and/or Merger
Sub in accordance with the terms of the debt commitment letter, (iii) Billtrust is ready, willing and able to consummate
the closing and Billtrust has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice that if specific performance is granted and the
equity financing and the debt financing are funded, then the closing will occur, and (iv) Parent fails to consummate
the closing within three business days after the delivery of such irrevocable written confirmation.

Eastern Time at 1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101, Lawrenceville, New Jersey 08648.
 
12TABLE OF CONTENTS
The special meeting is being held in order to consider and vote on the following:
1.
A proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger
(Proposal 1)” and “The Merger Agreement,” beginning on pages 31 and 56, respectively, of this proxy
statement;
2.
A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by
Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, discussed under
the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)-Interests of Billtrust’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger” beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement; and
3.
A proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of
such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement.
Only holders of record of Billtrust common stock at the close of business on November 4, 2022, the record date
for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or
postponements thereof. At the close of business on the record date, 164,717,883 shares of Billtrust common stock
were issued and outstanding, approximately 16.1% of which were held by Billtrust’s directors and executive officers.
We currently expect that, in addition to the shares to be voted in favor under the voting and support agreements, all
of Billtrust’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although no director or executive officer
is obligated to do so (except for Mr. Lane pursuant to the voting and support agreements).
The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Billtrust
common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will constitute
a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. If you submit a properly
executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted for purposes of calculating whether
a quorum is present at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an
adjournment or postponement and will subject Billtrust to additional expense.
You may cast one vote for each share of Billtrust common stock that you own at the close of business on the
record date. Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of Billtrust
common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date in accordance with Delaware law. The
proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to
its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the special meeting (provided that a quorum is present). The
proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Billtrust common stock present or represented by proxy
and entitled to vote at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present).
An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from
voting. At the special meeting, abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Because
under Delaware law the adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of
Billtrust common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date, abstentions and a complete failure to
vote (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of
shares held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or
other nominee) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
“AGAINST” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further solicitation of
proxies. Because the other proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or
negatively at the special meeting, abstentions and a failure to vote (including the failure of a record owner to execute
and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other
nominee to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of such
proposal.
If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned
and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted for (i) the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (ii) the proposal to
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by
13

Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger; and (iii) the proposal to
approve the adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies, if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement.

In considering the recommendation of the Billtrust board of directors to adopt the merger agreement, you should
be aware that Billtrust’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, those of Billtrust’s stockholders generally. The Billtrust board of directors was aware of these interests
and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve
the merger agreement and in recommending to Billtrust stockholders that the merger agreement be approved and
adopted. These interests are described in further detail and quantified below under “The Merger (Proposal 1) -

On October 27, 2022, a complaint was filed by a purported Billtrust stockholder against Billtrust and the members
of the board of directors, which seeks to enjoin the merger and other relief. The complaint asserts claims against all
defendants under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), and SEC Rule 14a-9, 17
C.F.R. 240.14a-9 and 17 C.F.R. § 244.100, for allegedly false or misleading statements in Billtrust’s preliminary proxy
statement filed in connection with the merger and against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act for alleged “control person” liability with respect to such allegedly false and misleading statements.
The defendants believe that the claims are without merit.

The merger consideration of $9.50 per share represents a premium of approximately 64% over Billtrust’s closing
share price on September 27, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement that Billtrust had entered into
the merger agreement and a premium of approximately 76% to Billtrust’s ninety (90)-trading-day volume-
weighted average stock price on the same date. The closing price of Billtrust common stock on the Nasdaq on
November 9, 2022, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, was $9.38 per share.
You are encouraged to obtain current market prices of Billtrust common stock in connection with voting your
shares of Billtrust common stock.
Q:
What will happen in the merger?
A:
If the merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Billtrust, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub will cease and Billtrust will be the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
As a result of the merger, Billtrust common stock will no longer be publicly traded, and you will no
15TABLE OF CONTENTS
longer have any interest in Billtrust’s future earnings or growth. In addition, Billtrust common stock will be
delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Billtrust will no longer be required to
file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to Billtrust common stock, in each case in accordance with
applicable law, rules and regulations.
Q:
Who will own Billtrust after the merger?
A:
Immediately following the merger, Billtrust will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Q:
What will I receive in the merger?
A:
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, if the merger is completed, the holders of
Billtrust common stock will have the right to receive $9.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes, for each share of Billtrust common stock that they own immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger.
Q:
What will happen in the merger to Billtrust equity awards?
A:
The merger agreement provides that any unvested stock options that are outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger with a per share exercise price of less than $9.50 will fully vest upon the effective
time of the merger. Any vested stock options (including those that vest pursuant to the preceding sentence)
that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger with a per share exercise price of less
than $9.50 will be canceled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of $9.50 over the applicable per
share exercise price of the stock option, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such stock option.
Any stock options that are outstanding as immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether vested
or unvested, that have a per share exercise price equal to or greater than $9.50 will be canceled for no
consideration immediately prior to the closing.
Any restricted stock units granted on or before September 28, 2022 that are outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, and any restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors at any time that
remain outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will fully vest (to the extent not already
vested) immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and will be canceled immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger in exchange for a cash payment equal to $9.50 multiplied by the total number of
shares subject to such restricted stock units. Any New RSUs (other than those granted to non-employee
directors) will be subject to the RSU Conversion described under “The Merger-Treatment of Billtrust Equity
Awards.”
All cash payments in respect of any Billtrust equity award will be paid, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes, promptly following the effective time of the merger and in no event more than five calendar
days following the effective time of the merger.
Q:
Are the holders of Class 1 common stock of Billtrust receiving the same per share merger consideration as
the holders of Class 2 common stock of Billtrust?
A:
Yes. Upon consummation of the merger, each share of Class 1 common stock and each share of Class 2 common
stock (in each case, other than the rollover shares and shares owned by Billtrust (as treasury stock), Parent or
any of their respective subsidiaries, Merger Sub or any stockholder who has properly demanded appraisal rights
in accordance with Delaware law) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $9.50 in cash, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my shares of
Billtrust common stock?
A:
If you comply with all the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL (including not voting in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement), you are entitled to have the “fair value” (as defined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL) of your shares of Billtrust common stock determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
and to receive payment based on that valuation instead of receiving the merger consideration. The ultimate
amount you would receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more than, the
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
same as or less than the amount you would have received under the merger agreement. To exercise your
appraisal rights, you must comply with the requirements of the DGCL. See “Appraisal Rights of Stockholders”
beginning on page 84 of this proxy statement and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute, Section 262 of
the DGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the merger agreement?
A:
The proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of
Billtrust common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date. In addition, under the merger
agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. A failure to vote
your shares of Billtrust common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote against
the merger proposal.
Q:
What vote is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be
paid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger?
A:
The named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, approval of which is not required to
complete the merger, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the
special meeting (provided a quorum is present or represented by proxy).
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient
votes at the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement?
A:
The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, the approval of which is not required to complete the merger,
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Billtrust common stock present in person
or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present).
Notwithstanding the inclusion or approval or disapproval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting,
whether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting, the chairperson of the special meeting may adjourn
the special meeting to another place, if applicable, date or time, in accordance with Billtrust’s Amended and
Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”).
Q:
Do any of Billtrust’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to
my interests as a stockholder?
A:
In considering the recommendation of the Billtrust board of directors with respect to the merger proposal, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of our Billtrust stockholders generally. The Billtrust board of
directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the
merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that the merger agreement be approved by the
stockholders of Billtrust. See “The Merger (Proposal 1) - Interests of Billtrust’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger” beginning on page 49 and “Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related
Compensation (Proposal 2)” beginning on page 88.
Q:
How will Mr. Lane and the Bain Capital Venture Entities vote the shares of Billtrust common stock they
hold?
A:
In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, and as a condition to Parent’s willingness to enter
into the merger agreement, Mr. Lane (individually and through certain affiliated trusts) and the Bain Capital
Venture Entities have each entered into separate voting and support agreements with Parent. The shares
beneficially owned by Mr. Lane (individually and through certain affiliated trusts) and the Bain Capital Venture
Entities represent, in the aggregate, approximately 33.3% of the outstanding shares of Billtrust common stock.
Mr. Lane (individually and through certain affiliated trusts) and the Bain Capital Venture Entities have agreed, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in their respective voting and support agreements, to vote their
shares of Billtrust common stock in favor of, among other things, the merger and the adoption of the merger
agreement, and against, among other things, any proposal relating to a competing transaction involving
Billtrust. See “The Transaction Agreements-Voting and Support Agreements” beginning on page 80.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
In order to complete the merger, Billtrust must obtain the stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement described in this proxy statement and the other closing conditions under the merger
agreement must be satisfied or waived. The parties to the merger agreement currently expect to complete the
merger in the fourth quarter of 2022, although Billtrust cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all.
Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, the exact timing of the merger cannot be determined at
this time.
Q:
What conditions must be satisfied to complete the merger?
A:
There are several conditions which must be satisfied to complete the merger, including, among other things, the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, compliance with certain other
regulatory filings and obtaining certain other regulatory approvals. The obligation of each party to consummate
the merger is also conditioned on the other party’s representations and warranties being true and correct
(subject to certain materiality standards) and the other party having performed in all material respects its
obligations under the merger agreement (subject to certain qualifications). Consummation of the merger is not
subject to any financing condition.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and act upon a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,
certain compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger?
A:
SEC rules require Billtrust to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve any agreements or understandings
and compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to in connection with the merger. Approval of this proposal by Billtrust’s stockholders is not
required to complete the merger.
Q:
Do you expect the merger to be taxable to Billtrust stockholders?
A:
The exchange of Billtrust common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state and local and other non-U.S. tax laws. In general, if you
are a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger” beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement), you will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the
difference between (1) the merger consideration you receive and (2) the adjusted tax basis of the shares of
common stock you surrender in the merger. Assuming you are a non-U.S. holder, your exchange of shares of
Billtrust common stock for the merger consideration generally will not result in U.S. federal income tax unless
you have certain connections with the United States. You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement and consult your tax
advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular
circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing
jurisdiction.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is November 4, 2022. Only stockholders of record at the close of
business on that date are entitled to attend and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof. The only class of stock that can be voted at the meeting is Billtrust common stock. Each outstanding
share of Billtrust common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the special meeting. At the
close of business on the record date, there were 164,717,883 shares of Billtrust common stock issued and
outstanding, approximately 16.1% of which were held by Billtrust’s directors and executive officers. We currently
expect that all of Billtrust’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although no
director or executive officer is obligated to do so.
Q:
Who may attend the special meeting?
A:
Only stockholders as of the close of business on November 4, 2022, or their duly appointed proxies, and invited
guests of Billtrust may attend the meeting. “Street name” holders (those whose shares are held through a broker,
bank or other nominee) who wish to vote at the special meeting must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from
your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Who is soliciting my vote?
A:
The Billtrust board of directors is soliciting your proxy, and Billtrust will bear the cost of soliciting proxies.
Georgeson has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Georgeson will be paid a solicitation fee of
approximately $18,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other
advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of
proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other like parties to the
beneficial owners of shares of Billtrust common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic
mail or other electronic medium by Georgeson or, without additional compensation, by certain of Billtrust’s
directors, officers and employees.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement, including its annexes. Whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting, please submit a proxy
to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the special
meeting.
Q:
How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record, there are four methods by which you may vote at the special meeting:
•
Internet: To vote over the internet, log on to the voting site indicated on your proxy card. If you vote
over the internet, you do not have to mail in a proxy card.
•
Telephone: To vote by telephone, call the toll-free number indicated on your proxy card. If you vote by
telephone, you do not have to mail in a proxy card.
•
Mail: To vote by mail, complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it promptly in the
postage paid envelope provided. If you return your signed proxy card to us before the special meeting, we
will vote your shares as you direct.
•
In Person: You may attend the special meeting and cast your vote there.
Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy, whether by internet, by telephone
or by mail, to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the meeting and vote your shares in person,
even if you have already voted by proxy. If you later decide to vote at the special meeting, your proxy prior to
the special meeting will be revoked; however, attending the special meeting will not revoke your written, internet
or telephone proxy, as the case may be, unless you specifically request revocation or cast a ballot at the special
meeting. Please choose only one method to cast your vote by proxy. We encourage you to vote over the
internet, which is a convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternative to returning a proxy card by mail.
Q:
How do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker (street name)?
A:
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in “street name,” you will
receive a form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be
voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other nominee with questions about how to provide or revoke
your instructions.
Q:
Can I change my vote after I submit my proxy?
A:
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke
your proxy in any one of three ways:
•
You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the internet, by
telephone or by mail;
•
You may send a written notice prior to the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof)
that you are revoking your proxy to the Office of the Secretary, BTRS Holdings Inc., 1009 Lenox Drive,
Suite 101, Lawrenceville, New Jersey 08648; or
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
You may attend the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) and vote in person.
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will have to follow the instructions provided
by your broker, bank or other nominee to change or revoke your proxy.
If you have questions about how to vote or change your vote, please contact Georgeson, the firm assisting us
in the solicitation of proxies, toll-free at 888-666-2594.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Billtrust common stock before the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of the merger. If you own shares of
common stock as of the close of business on the record date but transfer your shares prior to the date of the
special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but the right to receive the merger
consideration will pass to the person who holds your shares immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Billtrust common stock after the special meeting but before the effective
time?
A:
If you transfer your shares after the special meeting but before the effective time, you will have transferred the
right to receive the merger consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. In order to receive the
merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the merger.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. If the merger is completed, the exchange agent for the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and
instructions for exchanging your shares of Billtrust common stock for the merger consideration. PLEASE DO
NOT SEND ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY OR OTHERWISE SEND THEM TO
BILLTRUST, PARENT OR THE PROXY SOLICITOR.
Q:
How many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?
A:
The presence at the special meeting, by attendance in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the
shares of Billtrust common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the
record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special
meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or
postponement and will subject Billtrust to additional expense.
Q:
What if I abstain from voting?
A:
If you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal,
your shares will still be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If you abstain from voting
on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting or on the proposal to adjourn the special
meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the merger agreement, it will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposals. If you abstain from voting on the other proposal, it will
have no effect on the outcome of such proposal.
Q:
Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote over the internet, by mail, by
telephone or by attendance in person at the special meeting?
A:
If you are a registered stockholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote over the internet, by
telephone, by mail or by attendance in person at the special meeting, your shares will not be voted at the special
meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
If your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee,
your broker, bank or other nominee may vote your shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote
your shares on non-routine matters. Under Nasdaq rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-
routine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are held in “street name” and you do not issue instructions to your
broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you fail to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card by mail, or vote via the internet, by telephone or by
attendance in person at the special meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement and “AGAINST” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if
necessary to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the
other proposal.
Q:
What is a broker non-vote?
A:
Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers and other record holders that are present or represented by proxy
at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the
beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary
voting power on such proposal. Because brokers and other record holders do not have discretionary voting
authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of
shares of Billtrust common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker or other
holder of record, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the special meeting. As a
result, it is expected that there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals
described in this proxy statement.
If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted and
the effect will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and “AGAINST”
the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the adoption
of the merger agreement. However, a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote on the non-
binding proposal regarding merger-related compensation for Billtrust’s named executive officers (assuming a
quorum is present) will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal.
Q:
Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes
with shares I hold of record?
A:
No. Because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than
any shares you hold of record, any shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you
hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as
trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy
card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation
or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement
account must be voted under the rules governing the account.
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
A:
This means you own shares of Billtrust common stock that are registered under different names or are in more
than one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a stockholder of record and other shares
through a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive
multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions
for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares
you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by
mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
Q:
Who will count the votes?
A:
A representative from Georgeson will serve as the inspector of election.
Q:
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?
A:
If you are unable to attend the special meeting, you may participate by completing, signing, dating and returning
your proxy card or by voting over the internet or by telephone.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
Billtrust intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a
Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Billtrust
files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by Billtrust stockholders or if the merger is not completed
for any other reason, Billtrust stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Billtrust common
stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Billtrust will remain an independent public company and shares of
Billtrust common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq.
The merger agreement provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances,
Billtrust will be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $50,245,503.85, or under certain other
circumstances, Billtrust may be entitled to receive a reverse termination fee of $100,491,007.71 from Parent. If
Parent commences an action or proceeding that results in a judgment against Billtrust for the payment of the
termination fee, Billtrust shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses actually incurred by Parent in connection with such action or proceeding) in an amount not to exceed
$5,000,000 in the aggregate. If Billtrust commences an action or proceeding that results in a judgment against
Parent for the payment of the reverse termination fee, Parent shall pay to Billtrust its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses actually incurred by Billtrust in connection with such action
or proceeding) in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate.
See the section entitled “The Merger-Termination Fee Payable by Billtrust and Reverse Termination Fee Payable
by Parent” beginning on page 1
1 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which
such a termination fee or a reverse termination fee will be required to be paid.
Q:
How can I obtain additional information about Billtrust?
A:
Billtrust will provide copies of this proxy statement and its 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, including its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, without charge to any stockholder
who makes a written request to our Secretary at BTRS Holdings Inc., 1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101, Lawrenceville,
New Jersey 08648. Billtrust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings may also be accessed at
www.sec.gov or on the Investor Relations section of Billtrust’s website at www.billtrust.com. Billtrust’s website
address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our
website is not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by reference by this or
any other reference to our website provided in this proxy statement.
Q:
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address
with another stockholder?
A:
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same
address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders.
This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for
stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Billtrust and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple
stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from
the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be
householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you
revoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to
receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a
brokerage account or Billtrust if you are a stockholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request
to BTRS Holdings Inc., 1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101, Lawrenceville, New Jersey 08648, Attn: Secretary, or calling
888-666-2594. Stockholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may
request that in the future they receive a single copy by notifying Billtrust at the telephone and address set forth
in the prior sentence. In addition, Billtrust will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or
telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a
single copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.

This proxy statement is being provided to the stockholders of Billtrust as part of a solicitation of proxies by the
Billtrust board of directors for use at the special meeting to be held at the time specified below, and at any properly
convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides stockholders
of Billtrust with the information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special

BTRS Holdings Inc._20221110_DEFM14A_20444054_4544754.Pdf,Purpose of the Special Meeting,"Purpose of the Special Meeting
At the special meeting, Billtrust stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following:
1.
A proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger
(Proposal 1)” and “The Merger Agreement,” beginning on pages 31 and 56, respectively, of this proxy
statement;
2.
A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by
Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, discussed under
the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)-Interests of Billtrust’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger” beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement; and
3.
A proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time
of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement.
Billtrust stockholders must adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If Billtrust stockholders fail to
adopt the merger agreement, the merger will not occur. The vote on executive compensation payable in connection
with the merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder
may vote to approve the executive compensation payable in connection with the merger and vote not to adopt the
merger agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not
be binding on either Billtrust or Parent. Accordingly, because Billtrust is contractually obligated to pay the
compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the merger
agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is consummated, and regardless of the outcome of the advisory
vote.
Billtrust does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. If any other matters are properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote on these
matters.
Recommendation of the Billtrust Board of Directors
After careful consideration, the Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused
themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) approved the merger agreement,
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the
Billtrust board of directors in reaching its decision to authorize and approve the merger agreement and the merger can
be found in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)-Billtrust’s Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 38
of this proxy statement.
The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the
rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) recommends that the Billtrust stockholders vote “FOR”
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,
certain compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at
the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement.

date will constitute a quorum. Any shares of Billtrust common stock held by Billtrust are not considered to be
outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the
special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or
postponement and will subject Billtrust to additional expense. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it
will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting and any adjournment of the special
meeting. However, if a new record date is set for the adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be
established. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be

Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Billtrust common
stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date. The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including
if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Billtrust common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special

the Bylaws.
The proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by
Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present,

effect on the outcome of this proposal.",38,38

An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either by attendance in person or by proxy, but
abstains from voting. At the special meeting, abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present,
and will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and “AGAINST” the

named executive officer merger-related compensation.
If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned
and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted “FOR” (i) the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (ii) the

at the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement.
Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers and other record holders that are present or represented by proxy
at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the beneficial
owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power
on such proposal. Because brokers and other record holders do not have discretionary voting

authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares
of Billtrust common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker or other holder of
record, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, it is expected
that there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals described in this proxy
statement. If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be
voted and the effect will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
“AGAINST” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the
adoption of the merger agreement. However, assuming a quorum is present, a failure to instruct your broker, bank or

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into Billtrust in accordance with the DGCL. As a result of the merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub
will cease, and Billtrust will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Billtrust common stock (other than the rollover
shares and shares owned by Billtrust (as treasury stock), Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, including
Merger Sub or any stockholder who has properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware law) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive $9.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes.
Upon consummation of the merger, your shares of Billtrust common stock will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and cease to exist in exchange for payment of the merger consideration described above
unless you have properly demanded and not failed to perfect or validly withdrawn appraisal rights in accordance with
Delaware law. As a result, you will not own any shares of the surviving corporation, and you will no longer have any
interest in its future earnings or growth. As a result of the merger, Billtrust will cease to be a publicly-traded company
and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Following consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation
will terminate the registration of Billtrust common stock on the Nasdaq and Billtrust will no longer be subject to
reporting obligations under the Exchange Act.
Except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and the applicable holder thereof, with respect to each outstanding
Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, (i) that is an Out-of-the-Money Option, such Company Stock
Option will terminate and be cancelled immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, without any consideration
payable in respect thereof, and will have no further force or effect and (ii) that is an In-the-Money Option, such
Company Stock Option will become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Company Stock Option
would not otherwise vest) and will terminate and be cancelled immediately prior to the effective time of the merger in
exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, to be
paid promptly following the effective time of the merger and in no event more than five calendar days following the
effective time of the merger, determined by multiplying (A) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such canceled Company Stock Option by (B) the number of shares subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
Except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and the applicable holder thereof and except with respect to New RSUs
(other than those granted to non-employee directors), immediately prior to the effective time, each Company RSU will
fully vest and be canceled and converted into the right of the holder to receive an amount in cash, without interest
and less any applicable withholding taxes to be paid promptly following the effective time of the merger, and in no
event more than five calendar days following the effective time of the merger, equal to the product of (i) the merger
consideration and (ii) the total number of shares subject to such Company RSU.
New RSUs (other than those granted to non-employee directors) will not accelerate immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger. Instead, they will be converted into cash awards immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, each in an amount equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration and (ii) the total number of shares
subject to the corresponding Company RSU, which cash awards will vest and be payable in equal monthly
installments over the two-year period immediately following the closing of the transaction, subject to the grantee’s
continuous employment as of the applicable vesting date; provided that any unpaid amount will vest and be payable
in a lump sum upon the grantee’s earlier termination of employment under circumstances that entitle the grantee to
severance under Billtrust’s severance guidelines, plans and agreements (including executive employment
agreements) set forth in a schedule to the merger agreement, or would have entitled the grantee to such severance
had the termination occurred within the first year following the closing of the transaction.
Prior to the effective time of the merger, no new offering period will commence following September 28, 2022
under the ESPP. Any contributions accumulated under the ESPP pursuant to an offering period in effect as

of September 28, 2022 will be used to purchase shares on the earlier to the occur of (i) the last day of the offering

BTRS Holdings Inc._20221110_DEFM14A_20444054_4544754.Pdf,Effects on Billtrust If the Merger Is Not Completed,"Effects on Billtrust If the Merger Is Not Completed
If the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by Billtrust stockholders or if the merger is not completed
for any other reason, Billtrust stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Billtrust common stock in
connection with the merger. Instead, Billtrust will remain an independent public company and shares of Billtrust
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq. In addition, if the merger is not completed,
Billtrust stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently
subject, including risks related to the industry in which Billtrust operates, the servicing of Billtrust’s debt, market
volatility and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the
merger not to be completed, it is likely that the price of Billtrust common stock will decline significantly. If that were to
occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Billtrust common stock would return to the price at which it trades as
of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares of Billtrust common stock. If the merger agreement is not approved
and adopted by Billtrust stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no
assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Billtrust will be offered or that Billtrust’s business, prospects or
results of operation will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, the merger agreement provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain
circumstances, Billtrust will be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $50,245,503.85, or under certain other
circumstances, Billtrust may be entitled to receive a reverse termination fee of $100,491,007.71 from Parent, upon the
terms of the merger agreement. If Parent commences an action or proceeding that results in a judgment against
Billtrust for the payment of the termination fee, Billtrust shall reimburse to Parent for up to $5,000,000 of its costs and
expenses incurred by Parent in connection with such action or proceeding (or settlement). If Billtrust commences an
action or proceeding that results in a judgment against Parent for the payment of the reverse termination fee, Parent
shall pay to Billtrust up to $5,000,000 of its costs and expenses incurred by Billtrust in connection with an action or
proceeding (or settlement).
See the section entitled “The Merger-Termination Fee Payable by Billtrust and Reverse Termination Fee Payable
by Parent” beginning on page 1

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement.
This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Billtrust board of directors,
EQT, Billtrust’s representatives, EQT’s representatives and other parties.
As part of the ongoing consideration and evaluation of Billtrust’s long-term strategic goals and plans, the
Billtrust board of directors and Billtrust’s senior management regularly review, consider and assess Billtrust’s
operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals
and plans. This review includes, among other items, the consideration of potential opportunities for business
combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives with a view towards strengthening Billtrust’s
business and identifying opportunities to maximize stockholder value. Representatives of private equity firms and
potential strategic partners have from time to time contacted and/or met with members of Billtrust management to
discuss Billtrust’s business, with a view to exploring whether to pursue a potential transaction with Billtrust.
On January 21, 2022, Arvindh Kumar, a representative of EQT Fund Management S.à.r.l. (“EQT”), reached out to
Clare Hart, a member of the Billtrust board of directors, to request an introduction to Billtrust’s Chief Executive Officer
for the purpose of discussing a potential transaction. On February 2, 2022, Ms. Hart introduced Mr. Kumar to Flint A.
Lane, Billtrust’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Billtrust board of directors.

On February 1, 2022, a private equity sponsor (“Financial Sponsor A”) contacted Matthew C. Harris, a member
of the Billtrust board of directors, to request an introduction to Billtrust’s Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of
discussing a potential transaction. On February 9, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A and Mr. Lane
discussed a potential transaction, and representatives of Financial Sponsor A provided a presentation to Mr. Lane.
During this conversation, representatives of Financial Sponsor A expressed interest in pursuing a transaction with
Billtrust and explained Financial Sponsor A’s experience with both FinTech companies and take-private transactions.
The representatives of Financial Sponsor A offered to submit a proposal in writing with an indicative price range, if
Billtrust was interested in a potential transaction. Later on February 9, 2022, Mr. Lane communicated the content of
the discussion with Financial Sponsor A to, and shared a copy of the presentation provided by Financial Sponsor A
with, the Billtrust board of directors, and suggested that the Billtrust board of directors discuss the approach for
responding to similar inbound inquiries during the next scheduled meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on
March 24, 2022.
On February 15, 2022, Mr. Kumar and Mr. Lane discussed a potential transaction and Mr. Kumar provided a
presentation to Mr. Lane. During this conversation, Mr. Kumar expressed interest in pursuing a transaction with
Billtrust, explained EQT’s interest in Billtrust and indicated EQT’s familiarity with Billtrust. Later on February 15, 2022,
Mr. Lane communicated the content of the discussion with EQT to, and shared a copy of the presentation provided
by Mr. Kumar with, the Billtrust board of directors.
On February 23, 2022, EQT submitted a non-binding proposal to Billtrust to acquire Billtrust in an all-cash
transaction at $10.00 per share (the “February 23 EQT Proposal”). The closing share price of Billtrust common stock
on February 23, 2022 was $5.61 per share. Later on February 23, 2022, Mr. Lane relayed the February 23 EQT Proposal
to the Billtrust board of directors, and suggested that the Billtrust board of directors discuss the February 23 EQT
Proposal during the next scheduled meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on March 24, 2022.
On March 8, 2022, Financial Sponsor A and Mr. Lane had a conversation in which Financial Sponsor A reiterated
its interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust and offered to submit a proposal if invited to do so by Billtrust. Mr.
Lane responded that the Billtrust board of directors would consider next steps (if any) with respect to a potential
transaction at the next scheduled meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on March 24, 2022, regardless of whether
Financial Sponsor A submitted a proposal to acquire Billtrust prior to the meeting. Later on March 8, 2022, Mr. Lane
communicated the content of the discussion with Financial Sponsor A to the Billtrust board of directors.
On March 14, 2022, Financial Sponsor A submitted a written non-binding proposal to Billtrust to acquire Billtrust
in an all-cash transaction at $9.05 per share. Later on March 14, 2022, Mr. Lane communicated the proposal from
Financial Sponsor A to the Billtrust board of directors, and suggested that the Billtrust board of directors consider
such proposal at its next scheduled meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on March 24, 2022.
On March 24, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members of management
and representatives of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”), longstanding financial advisor to the Billtrust
board of directors. During this meeting, the Billtrust board of directors considered the February 23 EQT Proposal and
the proposal submitted by Financial Sponsor A and determined that the Billtrust board of directors and Billtrust
management should continue evaluating the risks and benefits of a potential transaction, but that it was premature
for Billtrust to more actively pursue a potential transaction at this time.
On March 25, 2022, Mr. Lane informed EQT that the Billtrust board of directors had not yet reached a decision
regarding whether to move forward with a potential transaction.
On April 13, 2022, representatives of an additional private equity sponsor (“Financial Sponsor B”) and Mr. Lane
had a conversation in which representatives of Financial Sponsor B expressed interest in pursuing a transaction with
Billtrust and outlined the benefits of entering into a transaction with a company owned by Financial Sponsor B
(“Financial Sponsor B Portfolio Company”).
On April 19, 2022, Mr. Lane met with Mr. Kumar. During this meeting, Mr. Kumar reiterated EQT’s interest in a
potential transaction with Billtrust.
On April 26, 2022, Mr. Lane and a representative of Financial Sponsor A met for dinner and discussed the future
of business-to-business commerce and possible opportunities related to a potential transaction with Billtrust.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On April 27, 2022, Mr. Lane and the Chief Executive Officer of Financial Sponsor B Portfolio Company met for
dinner and discussed possible opportunities related to a potential transaction with Billtrust.
On May 3, 2022, Financial Sponsor A submitted to Billtrust a revised non-binding proposal to acquire Billtrust in
an all-cash transaction at $10.00 per share. Later on May 3, 2022, Mr. Lane communicated the revised proposal from
Financial Sponsor A to certain senior members of management of Billtrust, noting that the revised proposal was
unexpected because previously Financial Sponsor A had indicated to Mr. Lane that it was not interested in a
potential transaction at the $10.00 per share price level. Also on May 3, 2022, Mr. Lane communicated the revised
proposal from Financial Sponsor A to the Billtrust board of directors.
On May 26, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor B and the Chief Executive Officer of Financial Sponsor B
Portfolio Company met with Mr. Lane to reiterate its interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust and requested
that Financial Sponsor B be included if Billtrust decided to move forward with a sale process.
On May 26, 2022, Mr. Lane provided a general update to the Billtrust board of directors regarding recent
conversations with EQT, Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor B related to a potential transaction.
On May 27, 2022, Mr. Kumar and Mr. Lane discussed the February 23 EQT Proposal and whether this proposal
was contingent on fluctuations in Billtrust’s stock price. EQT confirmed that material fluctuations in Billtrust’s stock
price could lead it to modify the terms of its proposal.
On June 8, 2022, Mr. Lane met with a representative of Financial Sponsor A, during which Financial Sponsor A
reiterated its interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust.
On June 16, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met and considered potential strategic transactions involving
Billtrust. Also in attendance were members of management and representatives of Billtrust’s outside counsel and
representatives of J.P. Morgan. At the request of the Billtrust board of directors, representatives of J.P. Morgan
provided a market update and discussed the environment for potential strategic transactions involving Billtrust. The
Billtrust board of directors determined to continue to evaluate the potential for a strategic transaction, to conduct
further diligence and to formally engage J.P. Morgan to assist the Billtrust board of directors in its further
consideration of a potential strategic transaction if there was sufficient interest from any of EQT, Financial Sponsor A
or Financial Sponsor B in connection with pursuing a strategic transaction with Billtrust, in each case at a level of at
least $10.00 per share. The Billtrust board of directors also determined to direct members of management to approach
an additional financial sponsor with whom Billtrust has an ongoing business relationship (“Financial Sponsor C”) or
a possible strategic party (“Strategic Party A”) in pursuing a strategic transaction with Billtrust, in each case at a
level of at least $10.00 per share. The Billtrust board of directors directed Mr. Lane to conduct further diligence on
each of such parties to understand each party’s respective level of interest in a potential strategic transaction with
Billtrust. The Billtrust board of directors authorized Billtrust management to hold management presentations with,
and provide confidential information regarding Billtrust to, each of the parties (subject to entry into appropriate
confidentiality undertakings that included customary standstill commitments, with such restrictions automatically
falling away in the event that Billtrust entered into a definitive agreement with any third party with respect to a
merger, sale of assets or securities or other business combination (subject to specified thresholds)). The Billtrust
board of directors determined that given the level of interest in a potential transaction, the Billtrust board of directors
would continue to evaluate whether Billtrust should run a sale process or consider strategic alternatives.
During the two weeks following the June 16, 2022 meeting of the Billtrust board of directors, Mr. Lane relayed to
Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C that Billtrust was considering running a sale
process. Following an introduction from Mr. Harris, Financial Sponsor C expressed interest in pursuing a transaction
with Billtrust. During the same period, Strategic Party A expressed interest in pursuing a strategic transaction with
Billtrust, but indicated that it was not willing to pay a price per share of $10.00 or greater and declined to join the
potential sale process. J.P. Morgan communicated the content of the discussion with Strategic Party A to the Billtrust
board of directors.
On June 27, 2022, at the direction of the Billtrust board of directors, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted
and provided draft confidentiality agreements to each of EQT, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and
Financial Sponsor C. In early July, Billtrust entered into confidentiality agreements with each of EQT, Financial
Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. All of such confidentiality agreements
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
contained customary standstill provisions, with such restrictions automatically falling away in the event that Billtrust
entered into a definitive agreement with any third party with respect to a merger, sale of assets or securities or other
business combination (subject to specified thresholds).
During the period from July 13, 2022 until July 22, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Billtrust conducted
management presentations with each of EQT, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. In
addition, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Billtrust met for dinner with representatives of each of EQT and Financial
Sponsor A but did not discuss any details of a potential transaction.
On July 20, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members of management and
representatives of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP (“Davis Polk”), Billtrust’s legal counsel. After evaluating J.P. Morgan
and discussing J.P. Morgan’s qualifications, credentials and independence in connection with serving as Billtrust’s
financial adviser, the Billtrust board of directors approved engagement of J.P. Morgan to serve as Billtrust’s financial
advisor to assist in evaluating the merits of a potential strategic transaction, and entry into the proposed engagement
letter with J.P. Morgan (subject to receipt and review of the relationships disclosure from J.P. Morgan and the Billtrust
board of directors’ confirmation that such relationships disclosure did not present any material conflicts in
connection with the proposed engagement). On July 21, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided a relationship
disclosure letter to the Billtrust board of directors.
On July 27, 2022, Reuters published a news article reporting that Billtrust was exploring strategic alternatives. On
that date, Billtrust’s common stock closed at $5.68 per share, up approximately 8% from the day prior to such report.
On July 28, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Billtrust board of directors, sent a
process letter to EQT, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C inviting such parties to
submit preliminary, non-binding indications of interest with respect to a potential transaction with Billtrust no later
than 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on August 11, 2022.
During the period from late July to early August 2022, Billtrust and/or representatives of J.P. Morgan received
outreach from 16 additional potential counterparties, including five potential strategic counterparties and 11 financial
sponsors. Representatives of J.P. Morgan informed the Billtrust board of directors of such outreach. At the direction
of the Billtrust board of directors, Billtrust and/or representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with each of these parties
their interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust at a price equal to at least $10.00 per share. Based on these
conversations, Billtrust and/or the Billtrust board of directors determined that each of these parties were not
interested in proceeding at the proposed valuation level or did not have the ability to do so expeditiously (other than
EQT, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C).
On August 11, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan received non-binding indications of interest from EQT,
Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. Representatives of J.P. Morgan informed the
Billtrust board of directors of these non-binding indications of interest. EQT provided a non-binding written
indication of interest for an all-cash transaction at $9.00-$10.00 per share. Financial Sponsor A provided a non-
binding written indication of interest for an all-cash transaction at $8.10-$8.40 per share. Financial Sponsor B
provided a non-binding verbal indication of interest for an all-cash transaction at $8.50-$9.00 per share. Financial
Sponsor C provided a non-binding verbal indication of interest for an all-cash transaction at $8.00 per share.
On August 12, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met to assess the non-binding indications of interest
received on August 11, 2022. Also in attendance were members of management and representatives of Davis Polk and
J.P. Morgan. At the request of the Billtrust board of directors, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an overview of
Billtrust’s recent performance and reviewed the details of the non-binding indications of interest received from EQT,
Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. Following the departure of the representatives of
J.P. Morgan, the Billtrust board of directors discussed the other unsolicited indications of interest that had been
received following the Reuters news article of July 27, 2022. The Billtrust board of directors determined that based on
the initial indications of interest received, it was in the best interests of Billtrust to inform each such party that their
proposal was not a basis on which Billtrust would continue to discuss a potential transaction. The Billtrust board of
directors also agreed that if any of the parties were to improve its indication of interest, the board would be willing to
reconsider its determination as to whether to move forward with the sale process. The Billtrust board of directors
directed management to instruct each of the parties that had submitted a proposal that Billtrust would not be moving
forward with such party in light of the value offered and other aspects of their proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 12, 2022 and August 13, 2022, at the direction of the Billtrust board of directors, members of
management of Billtrust informed Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C that Billtrust
was terminating further discussions regarding a potential transaction based on the proposals received.
During the period from August 12, 2022 until August 14, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed EQT that
Billtrust was terminating further discussions regarding a potential transaction based on the proposals received and
discussed EQT’s continued interest in a potential transaction with Billtrust. Also during the same period, Mr. Lane
and representatives of EQT held conversations in which Mr. Lane emphasized that in light of the value offered,
Billtrust would not be moving forward with a potential transaction, and EQT requested the opportunity to submit a
revised proposal.
Following such conversations, on August 15, 2022, EQT submitted to Billtrust and representatives of J.P.
Morgan a revised, written non-binding indication of interest to acquire Billtrust for a per share price of $10.00 in cash
(the “August 15 EQT Proposal”).
On August 15, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members of management
and representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan. At the request of the Billtrust board of directors, representatives
of J.P. Morgan provided an update regarding its recent discussions with EQT with respect to the potential sale of
Billtrust, including the August 15 EQT Proposal. Members of the Billtrust board of directors considered the August
15 EQT Proposal and discussed whether it was likely that EQT would improve its offer to acquire Billtrust. The
Billtrust board of directors discussed whether a sale of Billtrust to EQT at the indicative price referenced in the
August 15 EQT Proposal would maximize value for Billtrust’s stockholders as compared to remaining an independent
company. The Billtrust board of directors decided not to make a determination regarding whether to engage further
with EQT in order to provide the members of the Billtrust board of directors with additional time to consider the
August 15 EQT Proposal and to see if there were any other near-term developments with respect to the sale process.
The Billtrust board of directors decided to reconvene at a later date to further discuss and decide what actions, if any,
Billtrust should take in response to the August 15 EQT Proposal.
On August 21, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members of management
and representatives of Davis Polk. Mr. Lane provided an update on recent conversations with EQT, and discussed
the likelihood that EQT would proceed with a transaction consistent with the terms of the August 15 EQT Proposal.
The Billtrust board of directors determined that it was advisable and in the best interests of Billtrust’s stockholders to
move forward with due diligence at this juncture and directed management to continue engaging with EQT with
respect to due diligence.
On August 28, 2022, EQT was granted access to a virtual data room containing certain non-public information
regarding Billtrust. Following such date, through the execution of the merger agreement, representatives of Billtrust,
EQT, and their respective advisors held a number of telephonic conferences regarding due diligence matters.
On August 31, 2022, Davis Polk provided a draft of the merger agreement to Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP
(“Weil”), outside counsel to EQT. On September 7, 2022, Weil shared a draft of the voting and support agreements.
Thereafter, during September 2022, Weil and Davis Polk exchanged drafts and negotiated the terms of the merger
agreement and the ancillary transaction documents (including restrictive covenant agreements and the voting and
support agreements).
On September 1, 2022, Mr. Lane and representatives of EQT met for dinner and discussed the proposed
transaction.
On September 22, 2022, Mr. Lane and representatives of EQT met for dinner, during which EQT reaffirmed its
commitment to the proposed transaction.
On September 23, 2022, representatives of Billtrust, EQT, Davis Polk and Weil met via video conference to
negotiate the outstanding issues in the merger agreement, including, among others, Billtrust’s remedies if EQT were
to breach its obligations to complete the transaction, the amount of the break-up fee potentially payable by Billtrust if
the merger agreement were to be terminated in certain circumstances and the approach for entry into or amendment of
material contracts by Billtrust between signing and closing and the outside date and issuance of equity prior to
consummation of the transaction. On the evening of September 23, 2022, Davis Polk shared a markup of the merger
agreement with Weil reflecting the outcome of these negotiations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 23, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan shared an updated relationship disclosure letter with the
Billtrust board of directors.
On the afternoon of September 24, 2022, a representative of EQT reported to representatives of J.P. Morgan and,
subsequently, to Mr. Lane, the outcome of EQT’s investment committee meeting. Citing challenging market
conditions and EQT’s current fundraising process, a representative of the EQT deal team indicated that EQT’s
investment committee had instructed EQT to reduce its total fund commitment to a potential transaction with Billtrust
from the then-current level of approximately $1.3 billion to $1 billion or less. In light of this instruction, and reduced
total fund commitment, EQT conveyed verbally a revised nonbinding proposal (the “September 24 EQT Proposal”)
with the following key terms: (i) the Bain Capital Venture Entities and an additional stockholder of Billtrust that had
not been involved in the sale process (the “Additional Stockholder”) would receive $8.00 per share in cash, (ii) all
other stockholders of Billtrust would receive $10.00 per share in cash and (iii) Mr. Lane would agree in conjunction
with entry into the merger agreement to “roll over” 50% of his pretax proceeds into EQT’s investment vehicle, as a
result of which Mr. Lane would continue to have an ownership interest in Billtrust post-closing.
Also on September 24, 2022, after Mr. Lane apprised Mr. Harris, a Managing Director of Bain Capital Venture
Investors, LLC, of the September 24 EQT Proposal, Mr. Harris indicated to Mr. Lane that the Bain Capital Venture
Entities were not willing to accept a lower per share price than the rest of Billtrust’s stockholders. In light of Bain’s
unwillingness to proceed on the basis of the September 24 EQT Proposal, and the fact that the Additional
Stockholder had not been involved in Billtrust’s consideration of a potential transaction, Billtrust did not contact the
Additional Stockholder to discuss the September 24 EQT Proposal.
On the morning of September 25, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members
of management and representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan. After receiving an update, the Billtrust board of
directors discussed the September 24 EQT Proposal. The Billtrust board of directors determined that the September
24 EQT Proposal was not viable in light of Bain Capital Ventures’ rejection of the proposed differential treatment of
stockholders and directed Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris to provide that feedback to EQT.
Shortly thereafter, on September 25, 2022, Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris provided to EQT the feedback from the
Billtrust board of directors.
During this conversation, the representatives of EQT told Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris that EQT would be willing to
proceed on the following basis (the “September 25 EQT Proposal”): (i) all stockholders of Billtrust would receive
$9.50 per share in cash and (ii) $125,000,000 of equity “roll over” into EQT’s investment vehicle, split evenly between
the Bain Capital Venture Entities and Mr. Lane. In addition, it is anticipated that Mr. Lane will be appointed to the
board of the surviving corporation following the merger, however Mr. Lane will have no contractual right to such
appointment and will be subject to removal by EQT at any time in its sole discretion.
Later on September 25, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met again, and also in attendance were members of
management and representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan. Mr. Lane updated the Billtrust board of directors on
the discussions with EQT and relayed the September 25 EQT Proposal. Davis Polk advised the Billtrust board of
directors about the implications of the September 25 EQT Proposal on the roles of Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris in the
process (in light of the “roll over” component of the September 25 EQT Proposal), and the Billtrust board of directors
discussed those implications. The Billtrust board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of the
Billtrust stockholders for Billtrust to continue discussions with EQT regarding a potential transaction on the basis of
the September 25 EQT Proposal. Later on September 25, 2022, Weil shared a draft of the rollover and contribution
agreements.
On September 27, 2022, representatives of Billtrust, Davis Polk, EQT and Weil met via video conference to
resolve the outstanding points in the merger agreement.
On the evening of September 27, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors met, and also in attendance were members
of management and representatives of Davis Polk and J.P. Morgan. Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris recused themselves.
Copies of the merger agreement, the other transaction agreements, a financial presentation by J.P. Morgan and a legal
presentation by Davis Polk had been provided to the Billtrust board of directors in advance of the meeting. A
representative of Davis Polk reviewed with the Billtrust board of directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law
and the material terms of the merger agreement and the other transaction agreements. A representative from J.P.
Morgan presented J.P. Morgan’s financial analysis of the $9.50 per share

in cash merger consideration and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
September 28, 2022, to the Billtrust board of directors to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject
to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the $9.50 per share in cash merger consideration was fair, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of the Class 1 common stock in the merger (other than holders of Excluded
Shares, as defined below). All of the directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who had recused themselves in
light of the rollover and contribution agreements) approved the merger agreement, the ancillary documents and the
transaction.
Later on the night of September 27, 2022 and into the early morning of September 28, 2022, Davis Polk and Weil
finalized the merger agreement and other transaction documents.
Early on September 28, 2022, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq, the merger agreement and other
applicable transaction documents were executed, and Billtrust and EQT publicly disclosed the proposed transaction.

At a meeting duly called and held on September 27, 2022, the Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane
and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above)
determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, and in the
best interests of, Billtrust and its stockholders and approved, adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement
and the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Billtrust board of directors
(other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements
mentioned above) also resolved that the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of
Billtrust at a special meeting of stockholders and to recommend that the stockholders of Billtrust vote to adopt the
merger agreement. The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in
light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) consulted with Billtrust’s senior management and
outside legal and financial advisors and considered a number of factors, including the following principal factors (not
in any relative order of importance) that the Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who
recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) believed to support its
decision:
•
the Billtrust board of directors’ (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the
rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) belief that the merger was more favorable to
Billtrust’s stockholders than the alternative of remaining a standalone independent company, which belief
was based on and informed by consideration of a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, including:
•
Billtrust’s business, current and projected financial performance and condition and future prospects in
relation to the merger consideration of $9.50 per share,
•
the uncertain returns to Billtrust’s stockholders if Billtrust were to remain independent, taking into
account, in particular, management’s financial projections of the future financial performance and
earnings of Billtrust, including those set forth below under “The Merger (Proposal 1)-Projected
Financial Information” and the risks involved in achieving those returns,
•
general industry, economic and market conditions, both on a historical and on a prospective basis,
and
•
current information regarding (i) Billtrust’s business, prospects, financial condition, operations,
technology, products, services, management, competitive position and strategic business goals and
objectives, (ii) geopolitical conditions and changing regulatory environment, which could affect
Billtrust’s business, and (iii) opportunities and competitive factors within Billtrust’s industry,
•
the Billtrust board of directors’ (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the
rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) belief that the risks and challenges to Billtrust’s
business described above, and in Billtrust’s SEC filings, create substantial execution risks relative to the
$9.50 per share price in the merger,
•
the fact that the merger consideration is all cash, so that the transaction will allow Billtrust’s stockholders
to realize a fair value, in cash, for their investment and provides such stockholders certainty of value for
their shares,
38TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the fact that, during the period leading up to the execution of the merger agreement, the Billtrust board of
directors explored and evaluated various potential strategic alternatives, including remaining as a
standalone public company, none of which alternatives was deemed more favorable to Billtrust’s
stockholders than the merger,
•
the fact that Billtrust and its financial advisor were contacted by a number of parties (including following
the publication of the Reuters article on July 27, 2022 stating that Billtrust was exploring strategic
alternatives),
•
the fact that Billtrust’s exploration of potential strategic alternatives involved a third-party solicitation
process involving the group of potentially most interested parties (including actively seeking proposals
from additional parties) that Billtrust and its advisors believed were capable of delivering an executable
proposal, in addition to Parent, which included both strategic and financial potential acquirors, three of
which, in addition to Parent, entered into confidentiality agreements with Billtrust and received information
related to Billtrust, and that Parent submitted the highest final offer to Billtrust in connection with such
process after active negotiations and multiple rounds of bidding,
•
the fact that Billtrust did not enter into any exclusivity arrangements with Parent and did not negotiate with
Parent on a contractually exclusive basis,
•
current and historical market prices of Billtrust common stock, including the market performance of Billtrust
common stock relative to other participants in Billtrust’s industry and general market indices, and the fact
that the merger consideration represented an attractive premium of more than 64% to Billtrust’s closing
stock price on September 27, 2022, the last trading day before the announcement of the merger, and more
than a 77% premium above the trailing 90-day volume weighted average stock price for the period ended
September 23, 2022,
•
the fact that Billtrust’s legal and financial advisors assisted Billtrust throughout the process and
negotiations and updated the Billtrust board of directors directly and regularly, which provided the Billtrust
board of directors with additional perspectives on the negotiations in addition to those of Billtrust’s
management,

constitute or would reasonably be expected to lead to superior proposals, the Billtrust board of
directors’ ability to (subject to the terms of the merger agreement) negotiate with another party
regarding a superior proposal and, subject to paying a termination fee to Parent in the amount of
$50,245,503.85, accept a superior proposal,
•
Parent’s obligation to pay a reverse termination fee to Billtrust in the amount of $100,491,007.71 under
certain circumstances and to reimburse Billtrust for up to $5,000,000 of its costs and expenses in
connection with an action or proceeding (or settlement) that results in a judgment that Parent must

financing,
•
the Billtrust board of directors’ (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light

letter and the termination equity commitment letter,
•
Billtrust’s ability to specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to cause the completion of the merger
under certain circumstances,
•
the fact that the merger agreement is not subject to a financing condition, in particular, that the
financing contemplated by the equity commitment letter and the debt commitment letter, together with
Billtrust’s cash on hand, were sufficient to fund the aggregate purchase price and the other payments
contemplated by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the merger agreement, and that Billtrust
is a named third party beneficiary of the equity commitment letter,
•

the fact that Billtrust and Parent agreed to take all actions (subject to certain enumerated exceptions)
to consummate the merger, including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably possible all
necessary filings and obtaining certain specified regulatory approvals in connection with the merger
or the consummation of the merger, as well as the merger agreement’s significant protection against
any regulatory impediments that could arise, as described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger” below, and
The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the
rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) also considered various potentially countervailing factors in
its deliberations related to the merger, including the following principal factors (not in any relative order of
importance):
•
the fact that holders of Billtrust’s Class 1 common stock (other than Mr. Lane and the Bain Capital Venture
Entities, each of whom will contribute a portion of their shares of Billtrust common stock to Parent in
exchange for equity interests in Bullseye Holdings) will not have an opportunity to participate in any future
earnings or growth of the combined company following the merger,
•
the possibility that the merger might not be consummated and the effect the termination of the transaction
(and the resulting public announcement) may have on the trading price of Billtrust common stock and
Billtrust’s business, operating results and prospects, which effect is likely to be exacerbated the longer the
time period between the signing and any termination of the merger agreement,
•
that Billtrust cannot solicit other acquisition proposals, and must pay Parent a termination fee in the
amount of $50,245,503.85 if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if the
Billtrust board of directors changes its recommendation to Billtrust’s stockholders to adopt the merger

agreement or exercises its right to enter into a transaction that constitutes a superior proposal, which
although such termination fee is consistent with fees payable in comparable transactions could deter
others from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to Billtrust’s
stockholders,
•
that the restrictions imposed by the merger agreement on the conduct of Billtrust’s business prior to
completion of the merger, requiring Billtrust to conduct its business only in the ordinary course and
imposing additional specific restrictions, may delay, limit or prevent Billtrust from undertaking business
opportunities that may arise during that period,
•
the possible effects of the pendency (or termination) of the merger agreement on Billtrust’s business,
operating results, prospects, employees, customers and suppliers,
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger agreement and consummating
the merger and the substantial time and effort of management required to complete the merger, which may
disrupt Billtrust’s business operations,
•
the fact that if the merger is not consummated, Billtrust will be required to pay its own expenses associated
with the merger,
•
the fact that Billtrust’s directors and officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or
in addition to, those of the other Billtrust stockholders (see below in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “- Interests of Billtrust’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”),
•
the fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Billtrust common stock pursuant to the merger will
generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
•
the risk of potential litigation relating to the merger that could be instituted against Billtrust or its directors
or officers, and potential effects of outcomes related thereto or the possible loss of key management or
other personnel of Billtrust during the pendency of the merger,
•
the fact that the consummation of the merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States and
Cyprus, and
•
that if Parent fails to complete the merger as a result of a breach of the merger agreement, depending upon
the reason for not closing, Billtrust’s rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce through
litigation, and the success of any such action may be uncertain.
After considering the foregoing potentially negative and potentially positive factors, the Billtrust board of
directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution
agreements mentioned above) concluded that the potentially positive factors relating to the merger agreement and
the merger substantially outweighed the potentially negative factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Billtrust board of directors (other
than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned
above) is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the Billtrust board of
directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution
agreements mentioned above). The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused
themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) did not undertake to make any
specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support
its ultimate determination. The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused
themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) based its recommendation on the
totality of the information it considered.
In considering the recommendation of the Billtrust board of directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are
different from, or in addition to, yours. The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who
recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) was aware of and
considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger,
and in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Billtrust. See the section entitled
“The Merger (Proposal 1)-Interests of Billtrust’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Pursuant to an engagement letter, Billtrust retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the
merger and to deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the merger.
At the meeting of the Billtrust board of directors on September 27, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to
the board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion,
the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of the Class 1 common stock in the merger (other than the holders
of the Excluded Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its
September 27, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Billtrust board of directors, dated September
28, 2022, that, as of such date, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of the Class 1 common stock (other
than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated September 28, 2022, which sets forth, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of
J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion.
The holders of the Class 1 common stock are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion is
addressed to the Billtrust board of directors (in its capacity as such), was directed only to the consideration to be
paid to the holders of Class 1 common stock (other than the holders of Excluded Shares) in the merger and did not
address any other aspect of the merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to
the holders of any other class of securities, holders of the Excluded Shares, creditors or other constituencies of
Billtrust or as to the underlying decision by Billtrust to engage in the merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion
was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of Billtrust as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated September 27, 2022;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Billtrust and the
industries in which it operates;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of Billtrust with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical
market prices of the Class 1 common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;
•
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of Billtrust relating
to its business (which analyses and forecasts are summarized under the sections titled “Caution Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” and “The Merger (Proposal 1)-Projected Financial Information” beginning
on pages 24 and 48, respectively of this proxy statement); and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan
deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
42TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Billtrust with respect to
certain aspects of the merger, the past and current business operations of Billtrust, the financial condition and future
prospects and operations of Billtrust, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its
inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information
that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Billtrust or otherwise reviewed by or
for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,
pursuant to its engagement letter with Billtrust, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such
independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any
assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of Billtrust or Parent under any state or federal laws
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses provided to it or derived
therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of Billtrust to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such
analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be consummated as described in the merger
agreement, and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof
furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by Billtrust and
Parent in the merger agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to
its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to
Billtrust with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other
consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect
on Billtrust or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.
The financial analyses and forecasts furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by Billtrust’s management. Billtrust
does not publicly disclose internal financial analyses and forecasts of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection
with J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public
disclosure. These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and
may be beyond the control of Billtrust’s management, including factors related to general economic and competitive
conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in
such projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please
refer to the sections entitled “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 24 and “The
Merger (Proposal 1)-Projected Financial Information” beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to J.P. Morgan as of the date of such opinion. Subsequent developments may affect J.P.
Morgan’s written opinion dated September 28, 2022, and J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise,
or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration to be paid to the holders of the Class 1 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares)
in the merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration of,
the holders of any other class of securities, holders of the Excluded Shares, creditors or other constituencies of
Billtrust or the underlying decision by Billtrust to engage in the merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with
respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the
merger, or any class of such persons, any consideration payable in respect to Rollover Shares or any consideration
otherwise payable to any Significant Company Stockholders (as defined in the merger agreement) or any holders of
Class 2 common stock, $0.0001 par value, of Billtrust, in each case, relative to the merger consideration to be paid to
the holders of the Class 1 common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the merger or with respect
to the fairness of any such compensation or consideration.
The terms of the merger agreement, including the merger consideration, were determined through arm’s length
negotiations between Billtrust and Parent, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that of the Billtrust board of directors. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors
considered by the Billtrust board of directors in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Billtrust board of directors or Billtrust’s management with respect to the merger or
the merger consideration.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation
methodology in rendering its opinion to the Billtrust board of directors on September 27, 2022 and in the presentation
delivered to the Billtrust board of directors on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion and this
summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of
the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended
to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be
read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses. The following is a summary of the
material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with providing its opinion.
Public Trading Multiples
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of Billtrust with similar data
for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to Billtrust.
These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations
and businesses that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered sufficiently similar to those of
Billtrust. However, none of the companies selected is identical to Billtrust, and certain of these companies may have
characteristics that are materially different from those of Billtrust. The analyses necessarily involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies differently than they would affect Billtrust.
For each of the following analyses performed by J.P. Morgan, estimated financial data for Billtrust and the
selected companies were based on information J.P. Morgan obtained from public filings, and publicly available
information obtained from FactSet Research Systems. The multiples for each of the selected companies were based
on such information. Among other calculations, with respect to Billtrust and the selected companies, J.P. Morgan
calculated the ratio of each company’s “firm value” (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable, net debt
or net cash) as of September 23, 2022 to the analyst consensus estimates of net revenues for the calendar year 2023
for the applicable company (“FV / CY23E Revenue”).

Based on the results of this analysis and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate in its professional
judgment and experience, J.P. Morgan selected a trading multiple reference range of 3.3x to 6.6x for Billtrust’s FV /
CY23E Revenue. After applying such ranges to Billtrust’s forecasted revenue for the calendar year 2023, based on
Billtrust management’s projections, the analysis resulted in an implied per share equity value range, rounded to the
nearest $0.25, of approximately $4.75 to $9.00 for the Class 1 common stock. The range of implied per share equity
values for the Class 1 common stock was compared to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on September 23,
2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to publication of
news reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger consideration of $9.50

Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses which
J.P. Morgan judged to be similar to Billtrust’s business (or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan’s experience and
familiarity with the industries in which Billtrust operates. Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the transactions below,
and calculated the ratio of each target company’s firm value to the target company’s estimated net revenue for the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, the selected transactions were
chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered
sufficiently similar to the merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that
could affect the transaction differently than they would affect the merger.
Based on the results of this analysis and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected
a transaction multiple reference range for FV / NTM Revenue of 5.1x to 8.8x and applied it to Billtrust’s estimated net
revenue for the next twelve months provided by Billtrust’s management to calculate Billtrust’s firm value and imply a
per share equity value of Billtrust’s common stock. This analysis indicated an implied per share equity value range,
rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $6.75 to $11.00 for the Class 1 common stock. The range of implied per share equity
values for the Class 1 common stock was compared to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on September 23,
2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to publication of
news reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger consideration of $9.50
per share.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity
value per share for Billtrust’s common stock.
The unlevered free cash flows that Billtrust is expected to generate from June 30, 2022 through December 31,
2031 were provided to J.P. Morgan in the projections prepared by the management of Billtrust. J.P. Morgan calculated
a range of terminal values of Billtrust by applying perpetual growth rates ranging from 4.0% to 6.0% of the unlevered
free cash flow of Billtrust during the terminal year. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values
were then discounted to present values as of June 30, 2022 using a range of discount rates from 13.0% to 14.0%,
which was chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon its analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Billtrust.
In addition, as directed by management of Billtrust, J.P. Morgan calculated the present value of certain tax
credits expected by Billtrust management to be utilized by Billtrust from June 30, 2022 through December 31, 2029,
which were discounted to present values as of June 30, 2022 using the same range of discount rates, 13.0% to 14.0%.
The present values were then added together with the present values derived based on the unlevered free cash flows
and range of terminal values. This was then adjusted for Billtrust’s net debt of ($137,000,000) as of June 30, 2022, and
then divided by the number of fully diluted shares of Billtrust’s common stock outstanding at the midpoint, as
provided by Billtrust management (based on approximately 164,500,000 shares of common stock outstanding and
adjusted to reflect the impact of dilutive securities calculated in accordance with the treasury stock method to a total
fully-diluted share count of approximately 176,300,000 shares), to arrive at a range of implied equity value per share of
the Class 1 common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $8.00 to $10.75. The range of implied per share equity
values for the Class 1 common stock was compared to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on September 23,
2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to publication of
news reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger consideration of $9.50
per share.
Other Information
J.P. Morgan observed certain additional information that was not considered part of J.P. Morgan’s financial
analysis with respect to its opinion but was noted for informational purposes, including the following:
52-Week Historical Trading Range. J.P. Morgan reviewed the 52-week trading range of Billtrust’s end of day
share prices for the period ending September 23, 2022, which was $3.95 (an all-time low) to $11.01 (the 52-week high)
per share of the Class 1 common stock compared to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on September 23,
2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to publication of
news reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger consideration of $9.50
per share. J.P. Morgan noted that historical trading range analyses were presented merely for reference purposes only
and were not relied upon for valuation purposes.
Analyst Price Targets. J.P. Morgan reviewed the price targets of certain publicly available equity research
analyst price targets for the Class 1 common stock available as of September 23, 2022, which provided a reference
range of
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
$7.40 to $13.00 per share of the Class 1 common stock and $9.00 per share of Class 1 common stock at the midpoint.
J.P. Morgan compared the analyst price targets analysis to (i) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.77 on
September 23, 2022, (ii) the closing share price of Billtrust of $5.26 on July 26, 2022, the last full trading day prior to
publication of news reports relating to a potential acquisition of Billtrust, and (iii) the amount of the merger
consideration of $9.50 per share. J.P. Morgan noted that the analyst price target analyses were presented merely for
reference purposes only and were not relied upon for valuation purposes.
Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the
foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing
summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of
the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for
analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of Billtrust.
The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P.
Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors
considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative),
considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the
factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous
factors or events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or
made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the
selected companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to Billtrust, and none of the selected
transactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are
publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be
considered similar to those of Billtrust. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants,
size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the merger. The analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational
characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to Billtrust and
the transactions compared to the merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive
and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise Billtrust with
respect to the merger and deliver an opinion to the Billtrust board of directors with respect to the merger on the basis
of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its
familiarity with Billtrust and the industries in which it operates.
For services rendered in connection with the merger and the delivery of its opinion, Billtrust has agreed to pay
J.P. Morgan a fee of approximately $23,100,000, of which $4,000,000 became payable upon the delivery of the opinion
and the remainder will be payable upon the consummation of the merger. In addition, Billtrust has agreed to reimburse
J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of
counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement. During the
two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had, and continue to have,
commercial, investment banking or similar relationships with Billtrust, EQT AB and certain affiliates of the Parent for
which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received and will receive customary compensation. Such services during
such period have included acting as dealer for Billtrust in a spot and FX trade that closed in October 2021, as joint
lead bookrunner on Billtrust’s offering of equity securities that closed in June 2021, as financial and capital markets
advisor to Billtrust on a sale transaction that closed in October 2020 and as placement agent to Billtrust on an
offering of equity securities that closed in October 2020. J.P. Morgan has also acted as joint bookrunner on debt and
equity securities offerings, provided debt syndication and acted as financial advisor on strategic transactions by
EQT AB, the Parent and/or certain of their respective
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
affiliates unrelated to the merger. During the two-year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees
recognized by J.P. Morgan from Billtrust were approximately $14,300,000 and from EQT AB (including through certain
of its affiliates) were approximately $108,500,000. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent
bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of certain affiliates of EQT AB, for which J.P. Morgan receives
customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary
basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of Billtrust and EQT AB. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s
commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Billtrust and EQT AB,
for which J.P. Morgan receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In the ordinary course of their
businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments
(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Billtrust, EQT AB or certain affiliates of the Parent for their
own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in
such securities or other financial instruments.",53,59
BTRS Holdings Inc._20221110_DEFM14A_20444054_4544754.Pdf,Projected Financial Information,"Projected Financial Information
Billtrust does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance or earnings beyond the
current fiscal year and is especially wary of making projections for extended earnings periods given, among other
reasons, the unpredictability and uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Billtrust is
including in this proxy statement certain financial projections prepared by Billtrust management in 2022, which we
refer to as the “Management Projections,” to reflect Billtrust management’s then-current expectations of Billtrust’s
financial performance for fiscal years 2022 through 2027.
We have included a summary of the Management Projections to give stockholders access to certain nonpublic
information prepared by Billtrust management for the Billtrust board of directors in connection with its evaluation of
the merger and the merger consideration, which were also provided to J.P. Morgan, who was directed by the Billtrust
board of directors to use the Management Projections in their financial analyses with respect to the fairness of the
$9.50 per share consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger agreement. These Management Projections were also
made available to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parent’s request, in connection with their due diligence review of
Billtrust. The inclusion of the Management Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Billtrust, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives or any other
recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of actual future
results.
The Management Projections were developed by Billtrust management on a standalone basis without giving
effect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Furthermore, the Management
Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. The Management
Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Management Projections were based are subjective in
many respects. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and reflect numerous estimates
and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions,
changes to the business, financial condition or results of operations of Billtrust and other matters, including those
described under “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” many of which are difficult to predict, subject to
significant economic and competitive uncertainties, are beyond Billtrust’s control and may cause the Management
Projections or the underlying assumptions not to be realized. Since the Management Projections cover multiple years,
such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. The Management Projections do
not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared. As a result, there can
be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher
or lower than projected. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or
toward complying with GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information. For example, certain metrics included in the Management Projections are non-
GAAP measures, and the Management Projections do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP.
The prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of,
Billtrust’s management. Billtrust’s independent registered public accounting firm has not audited, reviewed, examined,
compiled, nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information
and, accordingly, Billtrust’s independent registered public accounting firm does not express an opinion or any other
form of assurance with respect thereto.

In considering the recommendation of the Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who
recused themselves in light of the rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) to adopt the merger
agreement, you should be aware that some of Billtrust’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, those of Billtrust’s stockholders generally. The Billtrust board of directors
was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement, in
reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and in recommending to our stockholders that the merger
agreement be approved. These interests are described and quantified below.
Treatment and Quantification of Equity-Based Awards
Billtrust’s executive officers currently hold vested and unvested Company Stock Options and/or Company
RSUs.
The merger agreement provides that at or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, the outstanding
equity awards of Billtrust will be treated as follows:
•
Company Stock Options. As of the record date, there were outstanding Company Stock Options to
purchase 17,319,238 shares of common stock of Billtrust, of which Company Stock Options to purchase
9,255,888 shares of common stock of Billtrust were held by Billtrust’s executive officers and non-employee
directors (6,005,888 of which were In-the-Money Options). With respect to each outstanding Company
 
49TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, (i) that is an Out-of-the-Money Option, such Company Stock
Option will terminate and be cancelled immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, without any
consideration payable in respect thereof, and will have no further force or effect and (ii) that is an In-the-
Money Option, such Company Stock Option will become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the
extent such Company Stock Option would not otherwise vest) and will terminate and be cancelled
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the applicable exercise
price of such canceled Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
•
Company RSUs. As of the record date, there were outstanding Company RSUs in respect of 4,658,043
shares of common stock of Billtrust, of which 1,752,245 Company RSUs were held by Billtrust’s executive
officers and non-employee directors. Except as provided below with respect to New RSUs, each Company
RSU will fully vest and be canceled and converted into the right of the holder to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration and (ii) the total number of shares subject to such
Company RSU.
•
New RSUs. If closing of the merger does not occur on or before March 31, 2023, Billtrust may grant New
RSUs to executive officers and non-employee directors in the ordinary course of business (provided that
any New RSUs awarded to the CEO or any direct report of the CEO or any Executive Vice President or
Senior Vice President of Billtrust is subject to the consent of Parent, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld). Except for grants of New RSUs made to non-employee directors, New RSUs will
not accelerate upon closing of the merger and will instead be subject to the RSU Conversion (including,
with respect to executive officers, potential payment of any unpaid amount of the as-converted cash award
upon termination of the executive officer’s employment without cause or for good reason with 24 months
following the merger).
•
ESPP. Prior to the effective time of the merger, no new offering period will commence following September
28, 2022 under the ESPP. Any contributions accumulated under the ESPP pursuant to an offering period in
effect as of September 28, 2022 will be used to purchase shares on the earlier to the occur of (i) the last day
of the offering purchase period and (ii) ten calendar days prior to the closing of the transaction. The ESPP
will terminate immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
All cash payments in respect of any Billtrust equity award will be paid, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes, promptly following the effective time of the merger and in no event more than five calendar days
following the effective time of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following table provides a summary of the outstanding and unvested In-the-Money Options and Company
RSUs that were held by Billtrust’s non-employee directors and executive officers as of November 4, 2022. No new
equity awards were granted to any non-employee director or executive officer in contemplation of the merger. Non-
employee directors will continue to receive grants of time-vesting restricted stock units in accordance with the
Billtrust Director Compensation Policy. If the merger transaction does not close by March 31, 2023, executive officers
may be granted New RSUs, subject to consent of Parent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.

individual’s outstanding unvested In-the-Money Options, less the aggregate exercise price attributable to each such Company
Stock Option.

Employment Agreements
Billtrust is a party to employment agreements (each, an “Employment Agreement”) with each of its executive
officers. The Employment Agreements provide that each executive officer will be eligible to receive the following
severance benefits upon a termination of employment by Billtrust without cause, or a resignation by the executive
officer for good reason within twenty-four months following a change in control (the merger will constitute a change
in control for purposes of the Employment Agreements):
•
a lump sum payment equal to one times (or two times for Mr. Lane and Ms. Killeen) the sum of the
executive’s then-current annual base salary plus target bonus;
•
any earned but unpaid prior year bonus;
•
a pro-rata portion of his or her then-current target bonus for the year of termination;
•
immediate accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity awards;
•
a lump sum payment equal to the amount that, on an after-tax basis, equals the total cost of COBRA
coverage for the executive for one year minus the premium that the executive would have paid as an active
employee over a one-year period (or for Mr. Lane and Ms. Killeen, two times such COBRA payment); and
•
the ability to exercise any outstanding and vested stock options through the 12-month period (or for Mr.
Lane and Ms. Killeen, the 24-month period) following the termination date.
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The payments and benefits described above are conditioned upon (i) the executive officer’s execution and
nonrevocation of a release of claims in favor of Billtrust; and (ii) complying with certain restrictive covenants,
including a noncompetition covenant (for two years post-employment in the case of a termination in connection with
a change in control) and nonsolicitation covenant (for a period of one year post-employment).
See “Interests of Billtrust’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation”
beginning on page 14 of this proxy statement for the estimated amounts that each of Billtrust’s named executive
officers would receive under his or her Employment Agreement upon a qualifying termination of employment
immediately following the effective time of the merger.
The Employment Agreements provide that in the event that any payment or benefit payable to each of the
executive officers in connection with his or her separation with Billtrust would constitute a parachute payment within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), then the payments will
be reduced to the largest amount which would result in no portion of the payments being subject to the excise tax if
such reduction will provide the executive officer with the best net after-tax result (a “Section 280G cutback”). The
Employment Agreements do not provide for a gross-up in the event the executive officer is subject to the “golden
parachute” excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the
compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger that will or may become payable to each named
executive officer of Billtrust in connection with the merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments
and benefits described below, see the discussion under the heading “Interests of Billtrust Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” above, which is incorporated herein to the extent that it applies to the named executive
officers.
For purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in table below, the following
assumptions were used:
•
The effective time is December 16, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for
purposes of the table below; and
•
The employment of each executive officer of Billtrust will have been terminated by Billtrust without “cause”
or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in their
employment agreements) immediately following the assumed effective time of December 16, 2022.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above or in the footnotes to
the table below, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior to completion of the merger,
including any equity award grants that may be made after September 28, 2022, such as New RSUs. Some of the
amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the merger (i.e. without
regard to whether a termination of employment occurs). In addition, the amounts shown below do not attempt to
quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of a Section 280G cutback, and therefore, actual payments to
the named executive officers may be less than the amounts indicated below.
Billtrust’s stockholders are being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that
will or may be paid by Billtrust to the named executive officers, as reflected below, that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger (see the section entitled “Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related
Compensation Arrangements (Proposal 2)” beginning on page 88 of this proxy statement). Because the vote to
approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Billtrust or Parent. Accordingly, if the
merger is approved by Billtrust’s stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable
regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions
applicable to the vote to approve the merger, which are described in the footnotes to the table and above under the
section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) - Interests of Billtrust’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement.

Rollover and Contribution Agreements
In connection with the merger, Mr. Lane and the Bain Capital Venture Entities each entered into a rollover and
contribution agreement with Parent pursuant to which, among other things, such parties agree to indirectly
contribute a portion of their shares of Billtrust common stock to Parent in exchange for equity interests in Bullseye
Holdings, subject to the terms set forth in the applicable rollover and contribution agreement. See the section titled

The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is not subject to any financing condition.
The total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions, including payment of related fees
and expenses, is anticipated to be approximately $1.7 billion. Parent intends to fund the consummation of the merger
and related transactions through a combination of committed debt financing, committed equity investments and cash
on the Billtrust balance sheet, as described in more detail below.
In connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the EQT Investors
have delivered the equity commitment letter to Parent, dated as of September 28, 2022, pursuant to
53TABLE OF CONTENTS
which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, such funds have committed to purchase from
Parent equity interests of Parent as may be required by Parent or Merger Sub to make payments due by Parent and
Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.24 billion in cash, in
immediately available funds.
In addition, Parent has obtained debt financing commitments consisting of a $375,000,000 secured term loan
facility for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the aggregate proceeds of which, together with
the cash on hand at Parent and the equity investment, will be used to (i) consummate the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payment of the per share merger consideration and
all related fees and expenses, and (ii) pay any other amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Pursuant to the debt
commitment letter, the debt commitment parties have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub, severally, but not
jointly, with the debt financing in the amounts and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt
commitment letter. The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt
commitment letter are subject to certain customary conditions.
In addition, Parent has entered into a termination equity commitment letter dated September 28, 2022 with the
EQT Investors pursuant to which the EQT Investors commit to provide funds to Parent for the purpose of paying the
reverse termination fee and certain of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s other obligations under the merger agreement.

The completion of the merger is conditioned on, among other things, certain specified regulatory approvals
having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect (or, in the case of certain specified regulatory approvals
that are statutory waiting periods, having expired or been terminated). Under the terms of the merger agreement, each
of Billtrust and Parent to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as
soon as reasonably possible, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any government
authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary filings and obtaining certain specified
regulatory approvals.
In particular the parties agreed that obligations of Parent include (subject to certain exceptions) (i) undertaking
certain regulatory concessions (including, for example and among other things, entering into any settlement or
agreement with any governmental authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines or assets and terminating existing
relationships or obligations), if necessary, (ii) defending any action, suit or proceeding that challenges the merger or
the transaction documents and (iii) seeking to have lifted, vacated or reversed any restraint by a governmental
authority with respect to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. If requested by Parent,
Billtrust and each of its subsidiaries shall agree to any such regulatory concession. However, none of Billtrust or its
subsidiaries are required to agree to any regulatory concession that is not conditioned upon consummation of the
merger, and nothing will require Parent to accept any regulatory concessions (including, with respect to (i) any
investment fund, investment vehicle, or management or advisory entity managed by, advised by, managing, advising,
or affiliated with Parent; or (ii) any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity
industry) or other investment of any such investment fund, investment vehicle, or management or advisory entity)
other than with respect to Parent and Parent’s subsidiaries (including Merger Sub, Billtrust and its subsidiaries).
On October 13, 2022, both Billtrust and Parent filed notification of the proposed merger with the United States
Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the
“Antitrust Division”) under the HSR Act.
In addition, prior to the effective time of the merger, Billtrust and Parent are required to obtain regulatory
approvals from Cyprus. On October 11, 2022, Parent filed a notification of the proposed merger with the Commission
for the Protection of Competition in Cyprus and received unconditional clearance on November 8, 2022.

The exchange of Billtrust common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state and local and other non-U.S. tax laws. In general, a U.S.
holder (as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”
beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement) whose shares of Billtrust common stock are converted into the right to
receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such shares. With respect to a stockholder that is a “non-U.S. holder” (as defined in the section
entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 92 of this proxy
statement), the exchange of shares of Billtrust common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger
generally will not result in U.S. federal income tax to such non-U.S. holder unless such non-U.S. holder has certain
connections with the United States.
You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning
on page 92 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

On October 27, 2022, a purported Billtrust stockholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York against Billtrust and the members of the board of directors, captioned O’Dell v. BTRS
Holdings Inc., et al., Case 1:22-cv-09212 (the “Complaint”). The Complaint asserts claims against all defendants under
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), and SEC Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9 and
17 C.F.R. § 244.100, for allegedly false or misleading statements in Billtrust’s preliminary proxy statement filed in
connection with the merger and against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for
alleged control person liability with respect to such allegedly false and misleading statements. The Complaint seeks,
among other relief, (1) to enjoin defendants from consummating the merger; (2) to rescind the merger or recover
damages, if the merger is completed; (3) to require the defendants to account to plaintiff for all damages suffered; (4)
costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees; and (5) granting other and further
equitable relief. The defendants believe that the claims are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of the merger
may be filed in the future. No assurances can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or the Complaint.

is attached hereto as Annex A to this proxy statement, is intended to provide information regarding the terms of the
merger agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Billtrust in its public
reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the merger agreement and the related summary are not intended to be, and
should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to Billtrust or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by Billtrust, Parent and
Merger Sub which were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specified dates. The representations,
warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger
agreement; may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by the
disclosure schedules to the merger agreement; were made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between
the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may apply contractual
standards of materiality or material adverse effect that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In
addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change
after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Billtrust’s

will be amended and restated in its entirety in accordance with the merger agreement. The bylaws of Merger Sub in
effect at the effective time of the merger will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation (except that references to the

BTRS Holdings Inc._20221110_DEFM14A_20444054_4544754.Pdf,Effect of the Merger on Billtrust Common Stock,"Effect of the Merger on Billtrust Common Stock
At the effective time of the merger, each share of Billtrust common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger (other than the rollover shares and shares owned by Billtrust (as treasury stock), Parent
or any of their respective subsidiaries, Merger Sub or any stockholder who has properly demanded appraisal rights in
accordance with Delaware law, together, the “excluded shares”) will be converted into the right to receive $9.50 in
cash, without interest and less any applicable withholdings taxes. As of the effective time of the merger, all such
shares of Billtrust common stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and
cease to exist, and will thereafter represent only the right to receive the merger consideration to be paid in accordance
with the terms of the merger agreement.
At the effective time of the merger, each share of Billtrust common stock held by Billtrust (as treasury stock) or
owned by Parent or Merger Sub will be canceled without payment of any consideration. At the effective time of the
merger, each share of Billtrust common stock held by any subsidiary of Billtrust or Parent (other than Merger Sub)
will be converted into such number of shares of stock of the surviving corporation such that each such subsidiary
owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock in the surviving corporation immediately following the
effective time of the merger as such subsidiary owned in Billtrust immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
Each rollover share will be unaffected by the merger and will, immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, be
contributed to Merger Sub (to be contributed to Parent thereafter) pursuant to the terms of the applicable rollover
agreement. In addition, shares of Billtrust common stock outstanding immediately prior to effective time of the merger
and held by a stockholder who has not voted in favor of the merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL will not be converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration, unless and until such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right
to appraisal. If any holder of Billtrust common stock that demands appraisal rights properly perfects such rights, such
holder will be entitled to the fair value of such shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery plus interest,
if any, on the amount determined to be the fair value, as further described in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights of
Stockholders” beginning on page 84 of this proxy statement.
Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
be converted into one share of common stock of the surviving corporation.",68,68

Prior to the effective time of the merger, Parent will appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Billtrust
for the purpose of exchanging for the merger consideration certificates representing shares of Billtrust common stock
or uncertificated shares of Billtrust common stock. At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Parent will make
available to the exchange agent an amount in cash that, when taken together with available cash of Billtrust that
Parent directs to be deposited with the exchange agent immediately following the effective time of the merger, is equal
to the merger consideration to be paid in respect of the certificates representing shares of Billtrust common stock or
uncertificated shares of Billtrust common stock.
As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger (but no later than three business days
thereafter), Parent will send, or cause the exchange agent to send, to each holder of shares of Billtrust common stock
at the effective time of the merger a letter of transmittal and instructions (in customary form which will specify that the
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of certificates representing
shares of Billtrust common stock or transfer of uncertificated shares of Billtrust common stock to the exchange agent)
for use in such exchange.
Each holder of shares of Billtrust common stock that have been converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration will be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the exchange agent of a certificate, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the exchange agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the exchange agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
uncertificated shares, in each case (i) or (ii), the merger consideration in respect of Billtrust common
57TABLE OF CONTENTS
stock represented by a certificate or uncertificated share (less any applicable withholding). Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such certificate or uncertificated share will represent after the effective time of
the merger for all purposes only the right to receive such merger consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue
on the cash payable upon surrender of any such shares.
If any portion of the merger consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered certificate or the transferred uncertificated share is registered, it will be a condition to such payment that
(i) either such certificate be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such uncertificated share
be properly transferred and (ii) the person requesting such payment must pay to the exchange agent any transfer or
other taxes required as a result of such payment or establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent and Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.
After the effective time of the merger, there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Billtrust
common stock. If, after the effective time of the merger, certificates representing shares of Billtrust common stock or
uncertificated shares of Billtrust common stock are presented to the surviving corporation, they will be canceled and
exchanged for the merger consideration.
Any portion of the merger consideration made available to the exchange agent for payment to the stockholders
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Billtrust common stock that have been converted into the right to receive
merger consideration nine months after the effective time of the merger will be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Billtrust common stock will thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the merger consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon and subject to any
withholding of taxes required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will not be liable to any holder
of shares of Billtrust common stock for any amount paid to any governmental authority pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar applicable law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Billtrust
common stock that have been converted into the right to receive the merger consideration two years after the
effective time of the merger (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any governmental authority) will become, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

subject to the corresponding RSU, which cash awards will vest and be payable in equal monthly installments over
the two-year period immediately following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
subject to the grantee’s continuous employment as of the applicable vesting date (provided that any unpaid amount
will vest and be payable in a lump sum upon the grantee’s earlier termination of employment under circumstances that
entitle the grantee to severance under Billtrust’s severance guidelines, plans and agreements (including executive
employment agreements) set forth in a schedule to the merger agreement, or would have entitled the grantee to such
severance had the termination occurred within the first year following the closing of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement).

event, change, circumstance, effect, occurrence, condition, state of facts or development that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on (i) Billtrust’s ability to

correct has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a parent material adverse
effect). For purposes of the merger agreement, a “parent material adverse effect” means any event, change,
circumstance, effect, occurrence, condition, state of facts or development that, individually or in the aggregate, would
be reasonably expected to prevent or materially impair, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of, or
materially adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate, the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or the other transactions on a timely basis.

indicates it will not review or have any further comments with respect to the proxy statement, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold, a meeting of Billtrust’s stockholders, which will be held as promptly as reasonably practicable but
in no event later than forty calendar days after the SEC indicates it will not review or have any further comments on
the proxy statement. The Billtrust board of directors will (x) include its recommendation in the proxy statement and (y)
unless an adverse recommendation change has occurred, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit such
adoption. Notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, Billtrust may, following consultation
with Parent and, if an adverse recommendation change has not occurred, will, at the request of Parent on no more
than one occasion for a period of no more than ten business days, postpone or adjourn the stockholder meeting (i)

informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of
the definitive proxy statement.

Subject to certain exceptions, Billtrust has agreed that from the date of the merger agreement until the
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, except as otherwise set forth below, Billtrust will
not, and will cause its subsidiaries’ and Billtrust’s directors and officers not to, and instruct its and its subsidiaries’
respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any “acquisition
proposal” (as described below),
•
enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to Billtrust
or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records, work papers
and other documents related to Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with,
any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, an acquisition proposal in connection therewith,
•
make an adverse recommendation change (as described below) with regard to the merger, or
•
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, indication of interest, term sheet, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating to an acquisition proposal.
Billtrust also agreed in the merger agreement to (and agreed to cause its subsidiaries and direct its and their
respective officers and directors and representatives to) cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party and its representatives with respect to any
acquisition proposal. To the extent that it has not done so prior to the date of the merger agreement, Billtrust will
promptly request that each third party, if any that has executed a confidentiality agreement with Billtrust within the
12-month period prior to the date of the merger agreement in connection with its consideration of any acquisition
proposal return or destroy all confidential information previously furnished or made available to such third party or
any of its representatives by or on behalf of Billtrust any of its subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time prior to obtaining the approval of Billtrust
stockholders, the Billtrust board of directors receives an acquisition proposal which has not resulted from a breach of
the restrictions set forth in the merger agreement that the Billtrust board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with, in the case of financial matters, its financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Delaware law, then Billtrust, directly or indirectly through representatives may:
•
engage in negotiations or discussions with any third party and its representatives in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement that has made after the date of the merger agreement a bona fide acquisition
proposal that did not result from a breach of the merger agreement if the board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with, in the case of financial matters, its financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a “superior proposal” (as described below);
•
furnish to such third party or its representatives non-public information relating to Billtrust or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which will be provided for informational
purposes only to Parent within twenty-four hours) with such third party with terms no less favorable to
Billtrust than those contained in the confidentiality agreement (it being understood and agreed that such
confidentiality agreement need not include provisions restricting any person from making, publicly or
privately, an acquisition proposal, or otherwise containing any standstill or similar provision and will permit
Billtrust to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement); provided that all such information (to
the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided
or made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made
available to such third party or its representatives; and
•
make an adverse recommendation change following receipt of a superior proposal (that did not result from a
breach of the non-solicit restriction by Billtrust) or in response to an intervening event, provided

that the Billtrust board of directors may do so only if the Billtrust board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law.
In addition, the Billtrust board of directors will not take any of the actions referred to above unless Billtrust
delivers to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action. In addition, Billtrust will
notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four hours) after receipt by Billtrust (or any of its
representatives) of any acquisition proposal, or any request for material non-public information relating to Billtrust or
any of its subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books, records, work papers or other
documents relating to Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries by any third party that has indicated it may be considering
making, or has made, an acquisition proposal. Such notice must be in writing and will identify the third party and the
material terms and conditions of any such acquisition proposal indication or request, and will be accompanied by a
copy of any material written agreements (or any material draft written agreements) delivered to Billtrust or its
representatives in connection with such acquisition proposal. Billtrust will keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
reasonably prompt basis, of the status of any such acquisition proposal including notifying Parent in writing within
twenty-four hours after the occurrence of any material amendment or modification thereof. Billtrust must promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four hours) notify Parent in writing if it determines to begin providing information or
to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “acquisition proposal” means, other than the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, any offer or proposal from any third party, relating to, in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions:
•
any acquisition or purchase, directly or indirectly, of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Billtrust and
its subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Billtrust or any of its
subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated
assets of Billtrust and its subsidiaries;
•
any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
third party beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Billtrust or any of
its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated
assets of Billtrust and its subsidiaries, or
•
a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business combination, sale of substantially all of
the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving
Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of
the consolidated assets of Billtrust and its subsidiaries.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “adverse recommendation change” means for the Billtrust board of
directors to (A) qualify, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the Billtrust board
recommendation, (B) adopt, endorse, approve or recommend any acquisition proposal, or resolve to take any such
action (C) following the date any acquisition proposal or any material modification thereto is first publicly
announced, other than in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation D promulgated under the
1934 Act, fail to issue a press release reaffirming the Billtrust board recommendation within the earlier of (x) ten
business days after a request by Parent to do so and (y) prior to the date of the company meeting, (D) fail to
recommend, in a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any acquisition proposal that is a
tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation D promulgated under the 1934 Act within the earlier of (x) ten
business days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer and (y) prior to the date of the
company meeting (as such date may be postponed or adjourned in accordance with the terms hereof) or (E) fail to
include the Billtrust board recommendation in the proxy statement when disseminated to the Billtrust stockholders.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means any bona fide, unsolicited acquisition
proposal after the date of the merger agreement, which the Billtrust board of directors determines in good faith, after
considering the advice of, in the case of financial matters, its financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
and outside legal counsel, to be (i) more favorable to the holders of shares from a financial point of view than the
merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions, including any financing condition or the reliability of any
debt or equity funding commitment, of, the identity of the third party making, the likelihood

of completion of, such acquisition proposal and any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation and the merger agreement (including, if applicable at the time of such determination, any
changes to the financial terms of the merger agreement then proposed by Parent in response to such offer or
otherwise that, if accepted by Billtrust, would be binding upon Parent)), and (ii) reasonably likely to be capable of
being completed, in each case taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal
that the Billtrust board of directors (or a committee thereof) considers relevant; provided, that for the purposes of this
definition of “superior proposal”, references to 15% in the definition of acquisition proposal will be deemed to be
references to 50%.
Changes in Board Recommendation",76,78
BTRS Holdings Inc._20221110_DEFM14A_20444054_4544754.Pdf,Changes in Board Recommendation,"Changes in Board Recommendation
Under the merger agreement, under certain circumstances and subject to certain requirements described in this
section, the Billtrust board of directors is entitled to make an adverse recommendation change prior to obtaining
stockholder approval, if the Billtrust board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that an acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal, or in response to
an intervening event, if the Billtrust board of directors determines that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that:
•
Billtrust notifies Parent in writing at least four business days before taking such action, that Billtrust
intends to take such action, which notice specifies the reasons for the adverse recommendation change
and attaches (A) in the case of an adverse recommendation change to be made in connection with a
superior proposal or a termination of the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, the most
current version of the proposed agreement under which such superior proposal is proposed to be
consummated, or (B) in the case of an adverse recommendation change to be made pursuant to an
intervening event, a reasonably detailed description of the reasons for making such adverse
recommendation change;
•
Billtrust has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, reasonably and in good faith with
Parent during such notice period any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement that Parent proposes;
and
•
After such four business day period, (A) in the case of any adverse recommendation change to be made in
connection with a superior proposal or a termination of the merger agreement in order to accept a superior
proposal, such superior proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a superior proposal (assuming
such revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect) (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such superior proposal will require a new written
notification two business days prior from Billtrust); and (B) in the case of an adverse recommendation
change to be made pursuant to an intervening event, such intervening event would nevertheless require
such adverse recommendation change, and, in either case, the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law.
In the event that the Billtrust board of directors is permitted to change its recommendation with respect to the
merger agreement following the receipt of an acquisition proposal that it determines to be a superior proposal,
Billtrust may also terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive written agreement for such superior
proposal if concurrently with such termination, Billtrust pays to Parent the fee required to be paid to Parent as
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee Payable by Billtrust and Reverse
Termination Fee Payable by Parent” beginning on page 1
1 of this proxy statement.
Nothing in the merger agreement prevents Billtrust or its board of directors (or any committee thereof) from
complying with Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act with regard to an acquisition proposal so long as any
action taken or statement made to comply with such rules is consistent with the non-solicitation restrictions.
However, any such action or statement that relates to an acquisition proposal is deemed an adverse recommendation
change under the merger agreement unless the Billtrust board of directors expressly reaffirms the recommendation of
the Billtrust board in connection therewith.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “intervening event” means an effect that was not known to the board of
directors prior to Billtrust’s execution and delivery hereof (or if known, the consequences of which were not known or
reasonably foreseeable (or the magnitude of which was not known or reasonably foreseeable) by the board of
directors as of the date of the merger agreement), which effect, or any consequence thereof (or
67TABLE OF CONTENTS
magnitude of which), arises or becomes known to the board of directors after Billtrust’s execution and delivery hereof
and before the requisite company vote is obtained. However that in no event will any of the following be an
intervening event or be taken into account in determining whether an intervening event has occurred: (1) the receipt,
existence or terms of an acquisition proposal; or (2) any change in the trading price or trading volume of the shares or
Billtrust’s meeting or exceeding any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenues,
earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (provided that any effect underlying such change,
meeting or exceedance that is not otherwise excluded by the foregoing clause (2) may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been an intervening event).
Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger
The completion of the merger is conditioned on, among other things, certain specified regulatory approvals
having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect (or, in the case of certain specified regulatory approvals
that are statutory waiting periods, having expired or been terminated). Under the terms of the merger agreement, each
of Billtrust and Parent has agreed to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement as soon as reasonably possible, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any
government authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary filings and other documents and
(ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations
required to be obtained from any governmental authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In particular, obligations of Parent under the
merger agreement include taking, and causing its subsidiaries to take, all actions necessary or appropriate to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable law or otherwise so as to enable the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event prior
to March 28, 2023), including:
•
entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with or required by any
governmental authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
•
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, any of its subsidiaries,
or those of Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries;
•
terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of Parent or its subsidiaries (including
those of Billtrust and each of its subsidiaries);
•
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the closing would limit Parent’s or its subsidiaries’
(including Billtrust’s or its subsidiaries’) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or exercise
rights of ownership or control with respect to, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent or its subsidiaries (including Billtrust or any of its Subsidiaries);
•
defending any action, suit or proceeding (including by appeal if necessary) that challenges any of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement which would otherwise prohibit, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and
•
seeking to have lifted, vacated or reversed any stay, injunction, temporary restraining order or other
restraint entered by any governmental authority with respect to the merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby.
If requested by Parent, Billtrust and each of its subsidiaries shall agree to any regulatory concession. However,
none of Billtrust or Billtrust’s subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any regulatory concession that is not
conditioned upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided that,
notwithstanding anything contained in this merger agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to accept
any regulatory concessions (including, with respect to (i) any investment fund, investment vehicle, or management or
advisory entity managed by, advised by, managing, advising, or affiliated with Parent; or (ii) any portfolio company
(as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) or other investment of any such investment
fund, investment vehicle, or management or advisory entity) other than with respect to Parent and Parent’s
subsidiaries (including Merger Sub, Billtrust and its subsidiaries).
In addition, each of Parent and Billtrust will (and Parent will cause its affiliates to) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
by the merger agreement as promptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement and in any event within 10
business days of the date of the merger agreement, and make or cause to be made all necessary registrations,
declarations, notices, or filings required under the antitrust laws in Cyprus as promptly as practicable. Each of Parent
and Billtrust will respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from any governmental authority for
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to use their
reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (I) each of Parent and
Billtrust may designate any non-public information provided to any governmental entity as restricted to “outside
counsel” only and any such information will not be shared with employees, officers, managers or directors or their
equivalents of the other party without approval of the party providing the non-public information, and (II) materials
may be withheld as necessary to address reasonable privilege, sensitive information or confidentiality concerns, or

BTRS Holdings Inc._20221110_DEFM14A_20444054_4544754.Pdf,Employee Matters,"Employee Matters
For 12 months following the closing of the merger, Parent is required to provide, or to cause its controlled
affiliates to provide (including the surviving corporation) to provide each Billtrust employee whose employment with
the surviving corporation (or Parent or any of its controlled affiliates) continues after the effective time of the merger
with (i) a base salary, wage or commission rate and annual cash bonus opportunities, in each case, that is at least
equal to the base salary, wage or commission rate and annual cash bonus opportunities provided to such continuing
employee by Billtrust and each of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the closing of the merger, (ii) health, welfare,
retirement and other employee benefits (excluding (A) any defined benefit pension benefits, (B) retiree health
benefits, (C) equity or equity based incentives, and (D) transaction, retention, or change in control bonuses) that are,
in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the health, welfare, retirement and other employee benefits (excluding
(A) any defined benefit pension benefits, (B) retiree health benefits, (C) equity or equity based incentives, and (D)
transaction, retention, or change in control bonuses) provided by Billtrust and each of its subsidiaries to such
continuing employee immediately prior to the closing of the merger, and (iii) severance protections and benefits that
are no less favorable than those provided by Billtrust’s severance policies.
If the closing of the merger occurs prior to the date on which annual bonuses in respect of the 2022 fiscal year
(“2022 Bonuses”) are normally paid, Billtrust will pay the 2022 Bonuses (and Parent will cause Billtrust to pay the
2022 Bonuses) at the same time annual bonuses would have otherwise been paid in the ordinary course of business;
provided that to the extent that after the effective time of the merger but prior to the time 2022 Bonuses are paid to
other continuing employees, any continuing employee’s employment is terminated by Billtrust without “cause” in a
manner that entitles the continuing employee to severance benefits under Billtrust’s severance policies, Parent will
pay such continuing employee their pro rata bonus amount at the time 2022 Bonuses are paid to other continuing
employees.
With respect to any “employee benefit plan,” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or its
controlled affiliates, excluding any defined benefit or retiree health and welfare plans, in which any continuing
employee is eligible to participate on or after the closing of the merger, for all purposes, including eligibility, vesting
and benefit accrual purposes, such continuing employee’s service with Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries prior to the
closing of the merger will be treated as service with Parent and its affiliates to the same extent as such continuing
employee was entitled, before the closing of the merger, to credit for such service under any analogous employee
benefit plan; provided that the foregoing will not apply to the extent that it would result in any duplication of benefits
for the same period of service or such service was not credited under the corresponding employee benefit plan.
With respect to any health and welfare benefit plans (excluding any retiree health and welfare plans) plan
maintained by Parent or its controlled affiliates in which any continuing employee is eligible to participate on or after
the closing of the merger, Parent will, or will cause its affiliates (including the surviving corporation) to (i) waive, or
cause to be waived, preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
with respect to participation by and coverage of the continuing employees to the same extent such preexisting
conditions, limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each continuing employee during the calendar year in which the closing of the merger
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible and co-payment limitations to the same extent as such
continuing employee was entitled, prior to the closing of the merger, to recognition of such co-payments, deductibles
and similar expenses under any health and welfare benefit plans maintained by Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries.
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance
For six years after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will indemnify and hold harmless
the present and former officers and directors of Billtrust (each, an “indemnified person”) in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or
provided under Billtrust’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date of the merger agreement;
70TABLE OF CONTENTS
For six years after the effective time of the merger, Parent will cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the
surviving corporation’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the surviving corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries
than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of the merger agreement.
Prior to the effective time of the merger, Billtrust will or, if Billtrust is unable to, Parent will cause the surviving
corporation as of the effective time of the merger to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable
extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of Billtrust’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance
policies and Billtrust’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, “D&O insurance”), in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the effective time of the merger with respect to
any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the effective time of the merger from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as Billtrust’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under Billtrust’s
existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries by
reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the effective time of the merger
(including in connection with the merger agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). However, in
no event will Parent or the surviving corporation be required to expend for such policy an amount in excess of 350%
of the aggregate annual premium paid by Billtrust in its last full fiscal year for the D&O insurance; and provided
further that if the aggregate cost of such tail policy exceeds such amount, the surviving corporation will be obligated
to obtain a tail policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time
of the merger, for a cost not exceeding such amount.
If the surviving corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the surviving corporation
will assume the obligations set forth in section 7.03 of the merger agreement.
The rights of each indemnified person will be in addition to any rights such person may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries, under the DGCL or any other applicable
law or under any agreement of any indemnified person with Billtrust or any of its subsidiaries. These rights will
survive consummation of the merger and are intended to benefit, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified person.
Financing of the Merger
The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is not subject to any financing condition.
The total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions, including payment of related fees
and expenses, is anticipated to be approximately $1.7 billion. Parent intends to fund the consummation of the merger
and related transactions through a combination of committed debt financing, committed equity investments and cash
on the Billtrust balance sheet, as described in more detail below.
In connection with financing the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the EQT Investors have
delivered the Equity Commitment Letter to Parent, dated as of September 28, 2022, pursuant to which, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, such funds have committed to purchase from Parent equity interests
of Parent as may be required by Parent or Merger Sub to make payments due by Parent and Merger Sub under the
Merger Agreement in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.24 billion in cash, in immediately available funds.
In addition, Parent has obtained debt financing commitments from the debt commitment parties consisting of a
$375,000,000 secured term loan facility for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the aggregate
proceeds of which, together with the cash on hand at Parent and the equity investment, will be used to (i)
consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payment of
the per share merger consideration and all related fees and expenses and (ii) pay any other amounts required to be
paid by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. The debt commitment parties have committed to provide Parent and
71

Merger Sub, severally but not jointly, with the debt financing in the amounts and on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter. The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt
financing under the debt commitment letter are subject to certain customary conditions.
Financing Cooperation

efforts to, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to use their reasonable best

connection with the arrangement of the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter, including:

commitment letters as in effect on the date of the merger agreement;
•
(x) executing and delivering any credit agreements, pledge and security documents, other definitive
financing documents or other requested certificates or documents (including a solvency certificate in the

solvency and will only be required to use reasonable best efforts to deliver such certificate to the extent
such representations the applicable section of the merger agreement relating to solvency are true and
correct in all material respects) and (y) facilitating the obtaining of guarantees and pledging of collateral

Billtrust will not be obligated to furnish any excluded information in connection with the foregoing.

•
take any action in respect of the debt financing that would conflict with or violate Billtrust’s or of its

will be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be

agreement will be deemed satisfied unless (A) Billtrust has materially breached its obligations under the applicable
section of the merger agreement, (B) Parent has notified Billtrust of such material breach in writing a reasonably
sufficient amount of time prior to the closing to afford Billtrust with a reasonable opportunity to cure such material
breach and (C) such material breach was a proximate cause of Parent’s failure to receive any material portion of the
proceeds of the debt financing.
Equity Commitment Letter

to Parent, pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, such funds have committed

Billtrust has agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of $50,245,503.85 in immediately available funds (the
“termination fee”) if:
•
Parent terminates the merger agreement because an adverse recommendation change has occurred;
•
Billtrust terminates the merger agreement in order for Billtrust to enter into a definitive written agreement
with respect to a superior proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions; or
•
(A) the merger agreement is terminated by Parent or Billtrust because the merger has not been
consummated by the end date or due to a failure to obtain the requisite company vote to consummate the
merger or by Parent because of an intentional breach of the non-solicitation restrictions by Billtrust, (B)
after the date of the merger agreement and prior to such termination (in the case of a termination pursuant
to a failure to consummate the merger by the end date or a breach by Billtrust) or the date of the special
meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to a failure to obtain the requisite company vote), an
acquisition proposal was publicly announced (or otherwise become publicly known) and not publicly
withdrawn and (C) within 12 months following the date of such termination. Billtrust (x) consummates a
transaction with respect to an acquisition proposal or (y) enters into a definitive agreement with respect to
an acquisition proposal and such acquisition proposal, whether during such 12-month period or thereafter,
is subsequently consummated (provided that for purposes of this clause ​(C), each reference to “15%” in
the definition of acquisition proposal in the merger agreement is deemed to be a reference to “50%”).
In addition, Billtrust will be required to reimburse Parent for up to $5,000,000 of its costs and expenses incurred
by Parent in connection with an action or proceeding (or settlement) that results in a judgment that Billtrust must pay
the termination fee.
Parent has agreed to pay Billtrust a reverse termination fee of $100,491,007.71 in immediately available funds
upon termination of the merger agreement if the merger agreement is terminated (i) by Billtrust (a) if all of the closing
conditions have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing),
Billtrust has given written notice to Parent, no earlier than the date on which closing should have occurred, that as of
such time, based on the information then-available, it is ready, willing, and able to take the actions within its control
to consummate the merger, but Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the merger within three business days of
receipt of such notice in accordance with the merger agreement or (b) in connection with Parent or Merger Sub
breaching its representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to
not be satisfied (subject to a cure period in certain circumstances) or (ii) if either party terminates because the merger
has not been consummated by the end date, and at the time of such termination, Billtrust was otherwise entitled to
terminate the merger agreement for either of the foregoing reasons.

The merger agreement provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under circumstances where the
termination fee is payable by Billtrust, Parent’s right to terminate the merger agreement and receive payment of the
termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against Billtrust and its subsidiaries
for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement to be consummated (including any damages for fraud) or for a breach or failure to perform thereunder
(including in the event of fraud or breach, whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise, or monetary
damages in lieu of specific performance), and upon payment of such amount, none of Billtrust or its related persons
will have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of the merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. However, nothing in the relevant section of the merger agreement will limit,
abridge or otherwise modify any remedies available to Parent under the confidentiality agreement or otherwise
preclude Parent from seeking monetary damages in the event the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances
in which the termination fee is not payable.
In addition, the merger agreement provides that, if Parent fails to effect the closing when required in accordance
with the merger agreement, breaches the merger agreement or the other transaction document or fails to perform any
obligation under applicable law (in each case, whether such breach or failure, as applicable is willful, intentional
unintentional or otherwise), then, as applicable, Billtrust’s right to specific performance or to receive the reverse
termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Billtrust pursuant to the merger agreement. In no event will
Parent be liable for any amounts in excess of the Maximum Liability Amount (as defined in the merger agreement)
including in the case of damages for fraud. In the event that the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances
in which the termination fee is payable, Parent’s right to terminate the merger agreement and receive payment of the
termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, Merger Sub, the debt financing sources, or any
of their respective and any of their respective related persons pursuant to the merger agreement.
If the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances where neither the termination fee is payable by
Billtrust nor the reverse termination fee is payable by Parent, the merger agreement will become void and of no effect
without liability of any party thereto or any related person (as defined in the merger agreement) except in the case of
fraud of such party or intentional breach of Billtrust prior to the valid termination of the merger agreement in

The merger agreement provides that the parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of the merger agreement, the termination equity commitment letter and/or the equity
commitment letter, or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions thereof, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason (other
than on the grounds that such remedy is sought in violation of the terms thereof), and not to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
The parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy, and that such remedy will be in addition to any other remedy to which a party is entitled at law or in equity.
In no event will Billtrust, or any of its related persons be entitled to specific performance or any other equitable
remedy to enforce or seek to enforce Parent’s obligation to cause all or any portion of the equity financing or the
rollover amount to be funded, or otherwise cause Parent to effect the closing or consummate the equity financing or
the transactions contemplated by the rollover and support agreement unless and only if (i) all of the conditions to the
obligations of the parties have been satisfied or waived in writing by Parent, (ii) the proceeds of the debt financing
have been received in full by Parent and/or Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of the debt commitment letter,

voting capital stock of Billtrust of which Mr. Lane and the Bain Capital Venture Entities acquire beneficial ownership
on or after the date of the applicable voting and support agreement, in accordance with the terms of such agreement.
Based on information provided by each of Mr. Lane and the Bain Capital Venture Entities:

•
against any acquisition proposal, or any other proposal made in opposition to, in competition with, or

Acquisition Proposals
Under the voting and support agreements, until the earlier of the effective time of the merger or the date and time
the merger agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms, Mr. Lane and the Bain Capital Venture Entities

designee, as the case may be) ability to comply with their fiduciary obligations while acting in their capacity as a
director, officer or employee of Billtrust.

or permit the transfer of any of their covered shares, other than with the prior written consent of Parent and (ii) seek
or solicit any such transfer or any such option, contract, arrangement, understanding or commitment with respect to
any transfer.

other transfer (by operation of applicable law or otherwise), either voluntary or involuntary, or entry into

The following discussion summarizes appraisal rights under the DGCL. The following discussion is not a
complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262
of the DGCL, referred to as “Section 262,” which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The following
summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders
exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of Billtrust common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement and who otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their
shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption and approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled
to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy
statement shall constitute such notice, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.
ANY HOLDER OF BILLTRUST COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, OR
WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE SUCH HOLDER’S RIGHT TO DO SO, SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE
FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANNEX C BECAUSE FAILURE TO TIMELY AND PROPERLY COMPLY WITH
THE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL OF SHARES OF
BILLTRUST COMMON STOCK, BILLTRUST BELIEVES THAT, IF A STOCKHOLDER CONSIDERS EXERCISING
SUCH RIGHTS, SUCH STOCKHOLDER SHOULD SEEK THE ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of Billtrust common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must, before the stockholder vote on
the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting is taken, deliver to Billtrust a written demand for the
appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A holder of
Billtrust common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written
demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the merger.
The holder must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy that is submitted and does not
contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will
effectively constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will effectively nullify any previously
delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or
abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger
agreement, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, will in and of
itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for
appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. The
demand must reasonably inform Billtrust of the identity of the holder as well as the intention of the holder to demand
an appraisal of the “fair value” of the shares held by the holder. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand
prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting of stockholders will
constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of Billtrust common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares
registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Billtrust common stock should be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record. The demand should set forth the registered holder’s name as it
appears on the holder’s stock certificates. A demand for appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Billtrust of
the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, execution of the demand must be made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more
than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy-in-common, the demand must be executed by
84TABLE OF CONTENTS
or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a
demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners
and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. If
the shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or nominee, the broker, bank or nominee may exercise appraisal
rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the rights with respect to
the shares held for other beneficial owners; in such case, however, the written demand should set forth the number of
shares as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is expressly mentioned, the demand will be
presumed to cover all shares of Billtrust common stock held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds
shares of Billtrust common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities
depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the
depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder. Stockholders who hold their shares
in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with
their brokers or other nominees to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by
such a nominee.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be sent or delivered to Billtrust at:
BTRS Holdings Inc.
1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101, 
Lawrenceville, New Jersey 08648
Attention: General Counsel and Secretary
At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal
and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement by delivering to Billtrust, as the surviving
corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand
made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written approval of Billtrust, as the
surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon
such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand
for appraisal and accept the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger. If Billtrust, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a
demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such
stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder
will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could
be less than, equal to or more than the consideration being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
Within ten days after the effective date of the merger, Billtrust, as the surviving corporation, must notify each
holder of Billtrust common stock who has complied with Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement, of the date on which the merger became effective.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, but not thereafter, Billtrust, as the surviving corporation,
or any holder of Billtrust common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a
copy served upon the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all such holders. Billtrust, as the surviving corporation, is under
no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition and holders should not assume that Billtrust as the
surviving corporation will file a petition. Accordingly, any holders of Billtrust common stock who desire to have their
shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of Billtrust
common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any
holder of common stock who has complied with the
85
TABLE OF CONTENTS
requirements of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from Billtrust as the surviving
corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders
of such shares. The statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written request therefor has been received by
Billtrust as the surviving corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal, whichever is later. The foregoing notwithstanding, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of
Billtrust common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s
own name, file a petition or request from Billtrust as the surviving corporation the statement described in this
paragraph. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to appraisal will cease.
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of Billtrust common stock and a copy thereof is
served upon Billtrust as the surviving corporation, Billtrust as the surviving corporation will then be obligated within
20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all
stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders, the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a
hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded
payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon
of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding; and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery’s determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of
common stock, an appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of
Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through this proceeding, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of Billtrust common stock as of the effective time of the
merger exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in
its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the
date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date
of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will direct the payment of such fair value, with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation
may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and
the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued,
unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on
the list filed by the surviving corporation pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who has submitted such
stockholder’s stock certificates to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all
proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining
fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that
“[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware
Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset
value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained
as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the
86
TABLE OF CONTENTS
merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of
value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or
expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements
of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the
fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not
in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. No representation is made as to the outcome of the
appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. In addition, Delaware courts have decided
that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenter’s exclusive
remedy. You should be aware that the fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could
be greater than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive
under the terms of the merger agreement. Billtrust does not anticipate offering greater than the merger
consideration to any stockholder who exercises appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of the Billtrust common stock shares is
less than the merger consideration.
Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon the surviving corporation and the stockholders
participating in the appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of
all shares entitled to appraisal. Any stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will not, after the effective date
of the merger, be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other
distribution with respect to those shares, other than dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of
record at a date prior to the effective date of the merger; however, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days
after the effective date of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers a written withdrawal of his, her or its demand for
appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease and
that stockholder will be entitled to receive the merger consideration, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes, for shares of his, her or its common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.
In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, our stockholders who may wish to dissent from the
merger and pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal advisor. To the extent there are any inconsistencies
between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL shall govern.

ARRANGEMENTS (PROPOSAL 2)","ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
(PROPOSAL 2)
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Billtrust is
required to submit a proposal to Billtrust stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the payment by
Billtrust of certain compensation that will or may be paid by Billtrust to its named executive officers that is based on
or otherwise relates to the merger. This proposal, commonly known as “say-on-golden parachutes,” and which we
refer to as the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, gives Billtrust stockholders the
opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the named executive officer merger-related compensation.
This compensation is summarized in the Golden Parachute Compensation Table under “The Merger (Proposal 1)-
Interests of Billtrust’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on
page 52 of this proxy statement, including the footnotes to the table.
The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the
rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) encourages you to review carefully the named executive
officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.
The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the
rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) recommends that the stockholders of Billtrust approve the
following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Billtrust hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the
agreements or understandings with and compensation to be paid or become payable by Billtrust to its
named executive officers that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item
402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Golden Parachute Compensation Table under the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger (Proposal 1)-Interests of Billtrust’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation”, the footnotes to that table and the accompanying narrative
disclosure.”
The vote on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the named executive officer merger-
related compensation is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Accordingly, you may vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer
merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-
related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Billtrust or EQT. Accordingly, if the
merger agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject
only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Billtrust
stockholders.
The above resolution approving the named executive officer merger-related compensation on an advisory basis
will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the special meeting.
The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the
rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a
non-binding, advisory basis.

Billtrust stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal to, as permitted under the terms of the merger
agreement, adjourn the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger
agreement. If this proposal to adjourn the special meeting is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by
Billtrust as permitted under the terms of the merger agreement. In addition, Billtrust, as permitted under the terms of
the merger agreement, could postpone the special meeting before it commences, if there are not sufficient votes at the
time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any
time prior to their use. If you return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, your shares
will be voted in favor of such proposal. Billtrust does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal
has been approved at a special meeting.
The special meeting may be adjourned to another place, date or time, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Billtrust common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at
the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present). Notwithstanding the inclusion or approval or disapproval
of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, whether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting, the
chairperson of the special meeting may adjourn the special meeting to another place, if applicable, date or time, in
accordance with the Bylaws.
The Billtrust board of directors (other than Mr. Lane and Mr. Harris, who recused themselves in light of the
rollover and contribution agreements mentioned above) recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the
special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement.

The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to “U.S. holders” and “non-
U.S. holders” (in each case, as defined below) of Billtrust common stock. This discussion applies only to holders that
hold their Billtrust common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment). This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to
a holder in light of the holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:
•
Dealers or brokers in securities or non-U.S. currencies
•
Traders subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to Billtrust common stock;
•
Persons holding Billtrust common stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion transaction,
integrated transaction or constructive sale transaction;
•
Persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
Partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax
purposes;
•
Persons who acquired Billtrust common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise
as compensation;
•
Foreign pension funds and their affiliates;
•
A “controlled foreign corporation”, “passive foreign investment company”, or corporation that
accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;
•
Certain financial institutions (including banks) and insurance companies;
•
Mutual funds;
•
Regulated investment companies;
•
Real estate investment trusts;
•
Certain former citizens or residents of the United States;
•
Holders of Billtrust common stock who exercise dissenters’ rights;
•
Tax-exempt entities;
•
Governmental agencies or instrumentalities;
•
Persons that hold Billtrust common stock through an “individual retirement account,” “Roth IRA,” or other
tax-deferred account;
•
Persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being
recognized on an applicable financial statement; or
•
Persons subject to the United States alternative minimum tax.
If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Billtrust common stock,
the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities
of the partnership. Partnerships holding Billtrust common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult
their tax advisor as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to them.
This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final and
temporary Treasury regulations, all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive
effect. This discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual
circumstances. In addition, tax considerations under state, local and non-U.S. laws are not addressed, nor is potential
application of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. Each Billtrust stockholder is strongly urged to
consult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or other tax
consequences to it of the merger.
92TABLE OF CONTENTS
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Billtrust common stock that
is:
•
A citizen or resident of the United States;
•
A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
An estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
A trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all the
substantial decisions of which are controlled by one or more U.S. persons or (ii) that has a valid election in
effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
The exchange of Billtrust common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of Billtrust common stock are converted into the right to
receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid
for such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Billtrust common stock (i.e.,
shares of Billtrust common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss generally will be
treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Billtrust common stock
exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders
generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. Capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may be subject to a 3.8% federal Medicare
contribution tax.
Non-U.S. Holders
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Billtrust common stock that is not a U.S. holder or a partnership (or
an entity treated as a partnership). Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Billtrust common
stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
The gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in
the United States (and if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s
permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States);
•
The non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of the exchange of shares of Billtrust common stock for cash pursuant to the merger and certain other
conditions are met; or
•
The non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than
5% of the Billtrust common stock at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger, and Billtrust
is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period that the
non-U.S. holder held Billtrust common stock.
A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal
income tax on any gain realized as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty
provides otherwise). If such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax
equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. holder described in
the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on any gain
realized, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year, even though
the individual is not considered a resident of the United States.If Billtrust is or has been a USRPHC at any time within
the shorter of the five-year period preceding the effective time of the merger or a non-U.S. holder’s holding period
with respect to the applicable shares of Billtrust common stock, the exchange of Billtrust common stock for cash in
the merger by such non-U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.
holders, except that the branch profits tax will not apply; provided, that, so long as Billtrust common stock is
regularly traded on an established securities market for purposes of the USRPHC rules, Billtrust’s treatment as a
USRPHC would cause only a

TABLE OF CONTENTS
non-U.S. holder who holds or held, directly or indirectly under certain ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of
Billtrust common stock (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period that
the non-U.S. holder held Billtrust common stock), and is not eligible for a treaty exemption, to be subject to such U.S.
federal income tax. Billtrust believes that it is not, and has not been at any time during the five-year period preceding
the merger, a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for shares of Billtrust common stock generally will be subject to information
reporting unless the holder is an “exempt recipient” and may also be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24%.
To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and
return Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer
identification number provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. A non-U.S.
holder that provides the applicable withholding agent with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or
W-8ECI, as appropriate, will generally establish an exemption from backup withholding.
Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited
against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the Internal
Revenue Service.
You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your
particular circumstances as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or
under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

If the merger is completed, we may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2023. If the merger is not
completed, you will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in our annual meetings of stockholders, and we
will hold a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, in which case we will provide notice of or otherwise publicly disclose
the date on which such 2023 annual meeting will be held. Billtrust will hold an annual meeting in 2023 only if the
merger has not already been completed. If the 2023 annual meeting is held, stockholder proposals will be eligible for
consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy for our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders in
accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and our bylaws, as described below.
Consistent with SEC regulations, proposals of stockholders of Billtrust that are intended to be presented at the
annual meeting to be held in 2023, and which stockholders desire to have included in Billtrust’s proxy materials
relating to such annual meeting, must be received by Billtrust no later than January 22, 2023, which is 90 calendar
days prior to the first anniversary of the mailing date for the 2022 annual meeting’s proxy statement, and no earlier
than December 23, 2022, which is 120 calendar days prior to such anniversary, and must be in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations in order to be considered for possible inclusion in the proxy statement for that annual

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same
address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This
process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders
and cost savings for companies.
Billtrust and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple
stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the
affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding
materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your
consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate
proxy statement and annual report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or
Billtrust if you are a stockholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request to BTRS Holdings Inc.,
1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101, Lawrenceville, New Jersey 08648, Attn: Secretary, or calling 888-666-2594. Stockholders
who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they
receive a single copy by notifying Billtrust at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition,
Billtrust will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy
of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered
pursuant to a prior request.

The Board of Directors
BTRS Holdings Inc.
1009 Lenox Drive, Suite 101
Lawrenceville, New Jersey 08648
Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Class 1
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of BTRS Holdings Inc. (the “Company”)
of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the Company with a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Bullseye FinCo, Inc. (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of September 28, 2022 (the “Agreement”), among the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Bullseye
Merger Sub, Inc., the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share
of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock (i) held in treasury (other than shares of
Company Common Stock in an Employee Plan (as defined in the Agreement) of the Company), (ii) owned by the
Acquiror, Merger Sub and any subsidiary of either the Company or the Acquiror, (iv) held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of the Merger (as defined in the Agreement) or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded
appraisal for such shares in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (v) that are
Rollover Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $9.50 per share of Company
Common Stock in cash (the “Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated September 27, 2022 of the
Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and
the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly
available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid
for such companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its
business; and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we
deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or
appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that
was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us.
We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such
analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that
the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also
assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and the
related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory
or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the
Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this
opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common
Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in
connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express
no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of (i) any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of
any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons, (ii) any consideration payable in respect to Rollover
Shares (as defined in the Agreement), or (iii) any consideration otherwise payable to any Significant Company
Stockholders (as defined in the Agreement) or any holders of Class 2 common stock, $0.0001 par value, of the
Company, in each case, relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the
Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation or consideration.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a
fee from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed
Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial,
investment banking or similar relationships with the Company, for which we and such affiliates have received
customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunner on the
Company’s offering of equity securities that closed in June 2021, as financial and capital markets advisor to the
Company on a sale transaction that closed in October 2020, as placement agent to the Company on an offering of
equity securities that closed in October 2020, and as dealer for the Company in a spot and FX trade transaction that
closed in October 2021. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have also had
commercial, investment banking or similar relationships with certain portfolio companies of the Acquiror, for which
we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included
providing debt syndication, equity and debt underwriting and M&A financial advisory services to the Acquiror and
certain of its portfolio companies unrelated to the Transaction. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an
agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of the Acquiror and certain of its portfolio companies, for
which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a
proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror. In the
ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial
instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or the Acquiror for our own
account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such
securities or other financial instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be
paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders.

In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §
253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights
shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

[Repealed.]
(c)
Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation, the sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation or a conversion effected pursuant to § 266 of this
title. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including
those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
(d)
Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1)
(1) If a proposed merger, consolidation or conversion for which appraisal rights are provided under
this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than
20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title)
with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations or
the converting corporation, and shall include in such notice either a copy of this section (and, if 1 of
the constituent corporations or the converting corporation is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114
of this title) or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at
which this section (and, § 114 of this title, if applicable) may be accessed without subscription or cost.
Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger, consolidation or conversion, a written
demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the
corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any)
expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger, consolidation
or conversion shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do
so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such
merger, consolidation or conversion, the surviving, resulting or converted entity shall notify each
stockholder of each constituent or converting corporation who has complied with this subsection and
has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger, consolidation or conversion, and any beneficial
owner who has demanded appraisal under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, of the date that the merger,
consolidation or conversion has become effective; or
(2)
If the merger, consolidation or conversion was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of
this title, then either a constituent or converting corporation before the effective date of the merger,
consolidation or conversion, or the surviving, resulting or converted entity within 10 days after such
effective date, shall notify each stockholder of any class or series of stock of such constituent or
converting corporation who is entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger, consolidation
or conversion and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of
stock of such constituent or converting corporation, and shall include in such notice either a copy of
this section (and, if 1 of the constituent corporations or the converting corporation is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title) or information directing the stockholders to a publicly
available electronic resource at which this section (and § 114 of this title, if applicable) may be
accessed without subscription or cost. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of
the merger, consolidation or conversion, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of
the merger, consolidation or conversion. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20
days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of
this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20
days after the date of giving such notice,

TABLE OF CONTENTS
demand in writing from the surviving or resulting entity the appraisal of such holder’s shares;
provided that a demand may be delivered to such entity by electronic transmission if directed to an
information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such
demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs such entity of the identity of the stockholder and
that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion, either (i)
each such constituent corporation or the converting corporation shall send a second notice before the
effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion notifying each of the holders of any class or
series of stock of such constituent or converting corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the
effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion or (ii) the surviving, resulting or converted
entity shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective
date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of
the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later
of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the
sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled
to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this
subsection and any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under paragraph (d)(3) of this
section. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation
or entity that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the
stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation or the converting
corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the
notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger,
consolidation or conversion, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and
the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
(3)
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section (but subject to this paragraph (d)(3)), a beneficial
owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares in
accordance with either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable; provided that (i) such
beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the effective date of the merger,
consolidation or conversion and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder
under the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial
owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is
accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and
a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and
provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the
surviving, resulting or converted entity hereunder and to be set forth on the verified list required by
subsection (f) of this section.
(e)
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion, the surviving, resulting
or converted entity, or any person who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and
who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in
the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger,
consolidation or conversion, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such person’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger, consolidation or conversion. Within
120 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion, any person who has complied
with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by
electronic transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that
purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the surviving, resulting or converted
entity a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger,
consolidation or conversion (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the
aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as
C-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for
purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2) of this title)), and, in either case, with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial
owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand pursuant
to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate
stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). Such statement shall be given to
the person within 10 days after such person’s request for such a statement is received by the surviving,
resulting or converted entity or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
(f)
Upon the filing of any such petition by any person other than the surviving, resulting or converted entity,
service of a copy thereof shall be made upon such entity, which shall within 20 days after such service file
in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by such entity. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving, resulting or converted entity, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly
verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place
fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving, resulting or converted
entity and to the persons shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. The forms of the notices by
mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving, resulting or converted entity.
(g)
At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the persons who have complied with this section
and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the persons who have demanded
an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of
stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if
any person fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If
immediately before the merger, consolidation or conversion the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent or converting corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national
securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are
otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1%
of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger, consolidation or conversion for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million or
(3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h)
After the Court determines the persons entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the
shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,
consolidation or conversion, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the
fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the
Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this
subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion through the date of
payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion and the date of payment of the judgment. At any
time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving, resulting or converted entity may pay
to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as
provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that
time. Upon application by the surviving, resulting or converted entity or by any person entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the
C-4
TABLE OF CONTENTS
persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving,
resulting or converted entity pursuant to subsection (f) of this section may participate fully in all
proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under this
section.
(i)
The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the
surviving, resulting or converted entity to the persons entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each
such person upon such terms and conditions as the Court may order. The Court’s decree may be enforced
as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving, resulting or converted
entity be an entity of this State or of any state.
(j)
The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the list filed
by the surviving, resulting or converted entity pursuant to subsection (f) of this section who participated
in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Court may order all or a portion of
such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal not dismissed
pursuant to subsection (k) of this section or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of
jurisdiction under subsection (k) of this section.
(k)
From and after the effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion, no person who has demanded
appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person’s shares as provided in subsection (d) of this
section shall be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on such shares (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a
date which is prior to the effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion); provided, however,
that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if a
person who has made a demand for an appraisal in accordance with this section shall deliver to the
surviving, resulting or converted entity a written withdrawal of such person’s demand for an appraisal in
respect of some or all of such person’s shares in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, then the
right of such person to an appraisal of the shares subject to the withdrawal shall cease. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any person
without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court
deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Court made
under subsection (j) of this section; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any
person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger,
consolidation or conversion within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation or
conversion, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
(l)
The shares or other equity interests of the surviving, resulting or converted entity to which the shares of
stock subject to appraisal under this section would have otherwise converted but for an appraisal demand
made in accordance with this section shall have the status of authorized but not outstanding shares of
stock or other equity interests of the surviving, resulting or converted entity, unless and until the person
that has demanded appraisal is no longer entitled to appraisal pursuant to this section.

11.6 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction.
(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would
not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under Applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is
vested in the federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual
damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. The Parties’ rights
in this Section 11.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and each Party hereby
waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 11.6.
(b) In addition, each of the Parties (i) consents to submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the
State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of
Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not
D-7
TABLE OF CONTENTS
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any
judicial proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the
State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of
Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction and (iv) consents to service of process being made through the

represented by counsel during the negotiation, drafting, preparation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
11.14 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the Parties in whole or in part (whether by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such consent shall be
null and void; provided that Buyer may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in
whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time; provided, further, that any
assignment by Buyer shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.
11.15 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby,
taken as a whole, is not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
11.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be

original signatures.
11.17 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY
OTHER STATE.
11.18 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement or in any schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive
the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that Buyer shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies with respect to any breach
prior to and including the termination of the representations, warranties, covenants and
D-9
TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreements made by the Stockholders, which breach (and all of the available remedies with respect thereto) shall
expressly survive the termination of this Agreement. This Section 11.18 shall not limit any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement that by its terms is to be performed in whole or in part after the
termination of this Agreement.
11.19 Termination. This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action by any of the Parties
and shall have no further force or effect as of the earliest to occur of (a) the Expiration Time and (b) with respect
to any Stockholder, the election of such Stockholder in its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement promptly
following any amendment of any term or provision of the original unamended Merger Agreement dated as of the
date hereof that reduces or changes the form of consideration payable pursuant to such Merger Agreement;
provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 11 shall survive any such termination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, termination of this Agreement shall not prevent Buyer from seeking any remedies (at law or in
equity) against any other Party for that Party’s breach of any of the terms of this Agreement prior to the date of
termination.

under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or
partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. Buyer shall not be deemed to have waived any claim available
to Buyer arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy of Buyer under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument
duly executed and delivered on behalf of Buyer; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect
except in the specific instance in which it is given.

RECITALS
WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer, Bullseye Merger Sub, Inc., a

“Merger Agreement”) that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, provides for
the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving entity in such merger

Company (the “Company Stock”) set forth next to such Stockholder’s name on Schedule A hereto, being all of the
shares of Company Stock owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder as of the date hereof (with respect to
such Stockholder, the “Owned Shares”, and the Owned Shares together with any additional shares of Company
Stock and any additional Company Securities that such Stockholder holds or may acquire record and/or beneficial
ownership of after the date hereof, such Stockholder’s “Covered Shares”);
WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) has unanimously (a) determined that
the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to which the
Company is or will be a party and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (b) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), (c) resolved, subject to Section 6.03(b) of the
Merger Agreement, to recommend approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company and (d) directed that the Transaction Documents to which the Company is or will be a party be submitted to
the stockholders of the Company for their adoption; and
WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition for Buyer and Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement,
each Stockholder has agreed to enter into this Agreement with respect to such Stockholder’s Covered Shares.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth below and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:
1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement. When used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned to them in this Section 1.
“Expiration Time” shall mean the earliest to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) such date and time as the
Merger Agreement shall be validly terminated pursuant to Article 10 thereof.
“Transfer” shall mean (a) any direct or indirect offer, sale, assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation,
disposition, loan or other transfer (by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise), either voluntary or involuntary, or
entry into any option, Contract, arrangement, understanding or commitment with respect to any offer, sale,
assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, disposition, loan or other transfer (by operation of Applicable Law
or otherwise), of any Covered Shares or any interest in any Covered Shares (in each case other than this Agreement),
(b) the deposit of such Covered Shares into a voting trust, the entry into a voting agreement or
E-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
arrangement (other than this Agreement) with respect to such Covered Shares or the grant of any proxy or power of
attorney (other than this Agreement) or similar arrangement with respect to such Covered Shares, (c) entry into any
hedge, swap or other transaction or Contract which is designed to (or is reasonably expected to lead to or result in) a
transfer of the economic consequences of ownership of any Covered Shares, whether any such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of Covered Shares, in cash or otherwise or (d) entry into any option, Contract, arrangement,
understanding or commitment (whether or not in writing) to take any of the actions referred to in the foregoing
clauses (a), (b) or (c) above; provided, however, that Transfer shall not include any such action between

of family members) of a Stockholder who contemporaneously executes a joinder to this Agreement.
2. Agreement to Not Transfer the Covered Shares.
2.1 No Transfer of Covered Shares. Until the Expiration Time, (a) each Stockholder agrees not to Transfer or
cause or permit the Transfer of any of such Stockholder’s Covered Shares, other than with the prior written
consent of Buyer (to be granted or withheld by Buyer for any reason or no reason) and (b) each Stockholder
shall not seek or solicit any such Transfer or any such option, Contract, arrangement, understanding or
commitment with respect to any Transfer. Any Transfer or attempted Transfer of any Covered Shares in violation

such Stockholder will send to Buyer a written notice setting forth the number of Covered Shares beneficially
owned by such Stockholder or any of its Affiliates and indicating the capacity in which such Covered Shares
are owned. Each Stockholder irrevocably agrees to cause any of its Affiliates that acquires any shares of
Company Stock or other Company Securities on or after the date hereof to execute an agreement in a form
reasonably acceptable to Buyer to be bound with respect to this Agreement with respect to such shares to the
same extent such shares would be subject to this Agreement had they been acquired by such Stockholder, and
such shares or other Company Securities shall be deemed Covered Shares for all purposes hereunder.
3. Agreement to Vote the Covered Shares.
3.1 Until the Expiration Time, at every meeting of the Company’s stockholders at which any of the following
matters are to be voted on (and at every adjournment, recess or postponement thereof), and on any action or
approval of Company’s stockholders by written consent with respect to any of the following matters, each
Stockholder shall vote (including via proxy) all of such Stockholder’s Covered Shares, in each case to the fullest
extent that the Covered Shares are entitled to vote thereon or consent thereto (or cause the holder(s) of record
on any applicable record date to vote (including via proxy) all of such Stockholder’s Covered Shares):
(a) in favor of (i) the Merger and the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, including any
amended and restated Merger Agreement or amendment to the Merger Agreement that increases the
Merger Consideration or otherwise is or results in the Merger Agreement being more favorable to the
Stockholders than the Merger Agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) the approval of any
proposal to adjourn or postpone any Stockholders Meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes
for adoption of the Merger Agreement on the date on which such meeting is held and (iii) the approval of
any other matter considered and voted upon by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Meeting
as contemplated as of the date hereof by Section 8.03 of the Merger Agreement or as advised by the board
of directors of the Company; and

breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company
contained in the Merger Agreement or that would result or would reasonably be expected to result in any
condition set forth in Article 9 of the Merger Agreement not being satisfied on a timely basis, (ii) any
Acquisition Proposal, or any other proposal made in opposition to, in competition with,
E-2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or inconsistent with, the Merger Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and (iii) any other action, agreement or proposal which could reasonably be expected to delay,
postpone or adversely affect the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
3.2 Until the Expiration Time, at every meeting of the Company’s stockholders (and at every adjournment or
postponement thereof), each Stockholder shall be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting (or cause
the holders of record on any applicable record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in
order for the Covered Shares to be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
3.3 Each Stockholder shall execute and deliver (or cause the holders of record to execute and deliver),
within 48 hours of receipt, any proxy card or voting instructions it receives that is sent to stockholders of the
Company soliciting proxies with respect to any matter described in Section 3.1, which shall be voted in the
manner described in Section 3.1 (with Buyer to be promptly notified (and provided reasonable evidence of) such
execution and delivery of such proxy card or voting instructions).
3.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time following the date hereof
and prior to the Expiration Time any Stockholder is restricted from taking any action pursuant to Section 3.1,
Section 3.2 or Section 3.3 of this Agreement by any applicable law or any order issued by any Government
Authority, then (a) the obligations of each Stockholder set forth in Section 3.1, Section 3.2 or Section 3.3 of this
Agreement shall be of no force and effect for so long as such order is in effect solely to the extent such order
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits such Stockholder from taking any such action, and (b) each Stockholder
shall cause the Covered Shares to not be represented in person or by proxy at any meeting at which a vote of
such Stockholder on the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby is sought or requested.
4. Waiver of Dissenter and Appraisal Rights. Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
and agrees to cause to be waived and to prevent the exercise of, any rights of appraisal, any dissenter’s rights and
any similar rights relating to the Merger or any related transaction that the Stockholder may have by virtue of, or with
respect to, the Covered Shares, including under Section 262 of the DGCL.
5. Acquisition Proposals.
5.1 Until the Expiration Time, (a) each Stockholder (solely in the capacity as a stockholder of the Company)
shall not, and shall direct its Affiliates and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist, participate in,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any effort by, any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made,

or make any public statement approving or recommending an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any

agreement, option agreement, voting agreement, support agreement or other similar agreement in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal or (v) agree to do any of the foregoing and (b) each Stockholder (solely in the
capacity as a stockholder of the Company) shall, and shall direct its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
5.2 Until the Expiration Time, each Stockholder (solely in the capacity as a stockholder of the Company)
agrees to notify Buyer promptly (and in any event within twelve (12) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries by any Person who has made or would reasonably be expected to make an Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice shall (A) indicate the identity of the Person who has made or could reasonably be expected to make
an Acquisition Proposal and (B) include a copy of any relevant written documents or agreements delivered to

E-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
offer (or, if not delivered in writing, a summary of the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer
or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request). Thereafter, such Stockholder
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within one (1) Business Day),
regarding any material changes to the status and material terms of any such inquiry, proposal or offer (and shall
provide Buyer with a copy of any relevant written documents or agreements delivered to the Company or its
Representatives that contain any material amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material
terms or conditions thereof (or, if not delivered in writing, a summary of any such material amendments or
material changes)).
5.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company is permitted, pursuant to Section 6.03 of the Merger
Agreement, to have discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, each Stockholder and
its Representatives shall be permitted to participate in such discussions or negotiations with the Person or
group making such Acquisition Proposal to the same extent as the Company is permitted to do so under Section
6.03 of the Merger Agreement, subject to compliance by such Stockholder with Section 5.2 above.
6. No Legal Action. Each Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, bring, commence,
institute, maintain, prosecute or voluntarily aid any claim, appeal, or proceeding in its capacity as a Stockholder
which (a) challenges the validity of or seeks to enjoin the operation of any provision of this Agreement or (b) alleges
that the execution and delivery of this Agreement by any of the Stockholders (or their performance hereunder solely
in the capacity as a stockholder of the Company) breaches any fiduciary duty of the Company Board (or any member
thereof) or any duty that any of the Stockholders have (or may be alleged to have) to the Company or to the other
holders of the Company Stock.
7. Fiduciary Duties. Each Stockholder is entering into this Agreement solely in its capacity as the record holder
or beneficial owner of such Stockholder’s Covered Shares. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way attempt to
limit or affect any actions taken by any of Stockholder’s or its Affiliates’ designee(s) or beneficial owner(s) serving
on the Company Board or any such Stockholder or in his or her capacity as a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Affiliates, from complying with his or her fiduciary obligations while acting in such designee’s
or beneficial owner’s capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company. No action taken (or omitted to be
taken) in any such capacity as a director, officer or employee shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this
Agreement.
8. Notice of Certain Events. Each Stockholder shall notify Buyer in writing promptly of (a) any fact, event or
circumstance that would cause, or reasonably be expected to cause or constitute, a breach of the representations and
warranties of such Stockholder under this Agreement or (b) the receipt by such Stockholder of any notice or other

this Agreement.

Agreement and (b) each Stockholder has sole voting power over all of the Covered Shares beneficially owned
by each Stockholder. Each Stockholder has not entered into any agreement to Transfer any Covered Shares. As

TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares of Company Stock or other voting shares of the Company (or any securities convertible, exercisable or
exchangeable for, or rights to purchase or acquire, any shares of Company Stock or other voting shares of the
Company) other than the Owned Shares. Any additional Company Securities acquired by the Stockholders after
the date hereof and prior to the Expiration Time will be owned beneficially or of record by the Stockholder, free
and clear of any Liens, subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, proxies, commitments, restrictions and Contracts
of any kind other than those created by this Agreement. Each Stockholder has and will have at all times through
the Expiration Time sufficient rights and powers over voting and disposition with respect to the matters set forth
in Section 2 and Section 3, and to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with
respect to all of the Covered Shares, with no other limitations, qualifications or restrictions on such rights, in
each case, subject to the terms of this Agreement. All of the Covered Shares are, as of the date hereof, held
directly by the Stockholders.
9.3 No Conflict; Consents.
(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Stockholder does not, and the performance
by each Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement and the compliance by each Stockholder with
any provisions hereof does not and will not: (i) conflict with or violate any Applicable Laws applicable to
the Stockholders, or (ii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the Covered Shares beneficially
owned by each Stockholder pursuant to any Contract or obligation to which each Stockholder is a party or
by which each Stockholder is subject.
(b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or, except as required
by the rules and regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act, filing with, any Governmental Authority or
any other Person, is required by or with respect to each Stockholder in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by them of the transactions contemplated hereby.
9.4 Absence of Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no legal action pending against, or, to the
knowledge of each Stockholder, threatened against or affecting each Stockholder that would reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of each Stockholder to perform its obligations hereunder or to

11.6 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction.
(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would
not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under Applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is
vested in the federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual
damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. The Parties’ rights
in this Section 11.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and each Party hereby
waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 11.6.
(b) In addition, each of the Parties (i) consents to submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the
State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of
Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or
claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it
E-7
TABLE OF CONTENTS
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court
located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court
of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction and (iv) consents to service of process being
made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 11.5.
11.7 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND
VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 11.7.
11.8 Documentation and Information. Each Stockholder consents to and authorizes the publication and
disclosure by Buyer and the Company of such Stockholder’s identity and holding of the Covered Shares, and
the terms of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of this Agreement), in any
press release, the Proxy Statement and any other disclosure document required in connection with the Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
11.9 Further Assurances. Each Stockholder agrees, from time to time, at the reasonable request of Buyer
and without further consideration, to execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further
action as may be reasonable required to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
11.10 Stop Transfer Instructions. At all times commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the Expiration Time, in furtherance of this Agreement, each Stockholder hereby
authorizes the Company or its counsel to notify the Company’s transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order
with respect to all of the Covered Shares (and that this Agreement places limits on the voting and transfer of the
Covered Shares), subject to the provisions hereof and provided that any such stop transfer order and notice will
immediately be withdrawn and terminated by the Company following the Expiration Time.
11.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including Schedule A, (a) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and (b) is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or
remedies. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to amend, alter or modify, in
any respect, any of the provisions of the Merger Agreement.
11.12 Reliance. Each Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Buyer and Merger Sub are entering
into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such Stockholder’s execution and delivery of this Agreement.
11.13 Interpretation. The words “hereof”, “herein” and “hereunder” and words of like import used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The
descriptive headings used herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part
of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. References to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and
Schedules are to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. All
Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or Schedule but not otherwise
defined therein, shall have the meaning as defined in this Agreement. Any singular term in this Agreement shall
be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term the singular. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Whenever the words
“include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the
words “without limitation”, whether or not they are
E-8
TABLE OF CONTENTS
in fact followed by those words or words of like import. Unless the context otherwise requires, “neither,” “nor,”
“any,” “either” and “or” are not exclusive. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” means the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and does not simply mean “if.” “Writing”, “written” and comparable
terms refer to printing, typing and other means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a visible
form. References to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute and to any rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder. References to any Contract or Applicable Law are to that Contract or Applicable Law,
as applicable, as amended, modified or supplemented (including by waiver or consent) from time to time in
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. References to “the transactions contemplated by this Agreement”
or words with a similar import shall be deemed to include the Merger. References to any Person include the
successors and permitted assigns of that Person. References from or through any date mean, unless otherwise
specified, from and including such date or through and including such date, respectively. References to any
period of days will be deemed to be to the relevant number of calendar days unless otherwise specified and if
the last day of such period is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the next succeeding Business Day.
The Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, drafting, preparation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of
proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.
11.14 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the Parties in whole or in part (whether by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such consent shall be
null and void; provided that Buyer may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in
whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time; provided, further, that any
assignment by Buyer shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.
11.15 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby,
taken as a whole, is not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
11.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement, it being understood that each Party need not sign the same
counterpart. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other Parties. Signatures delivered electronically or by facsimile shall be deemed to be
original signatures.
11.17 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY
OTHER STATE.
11.18 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement or in any schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive
the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that Buyer shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies with respect to any breach
prior to and including the termination of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the
Stockholders, which breach (and all of the available remedies with respect thereto) shall expressly survive the
termination of this Agreement. This Section 11.18 shall not limit any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement that by its terms is to be performed in whole or in part after the termination of this Agreement.
E-9
TABLE OF CONTENTS
11.19 Termination. This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action by any of the Parties
and shall have no further force or effect as of the earliest to occur of (a) the Expiration Time and (b) with respect
to any Stockholder, the election of such Stockholder in its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement promptly
following any amendment of any term or provision of the original unamended Merger Agreement dated as of the
date hereof that reduces or changes the form of consideration payable pursuant to such Merger Agreement;
provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 11 shall survive any such termination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, termination of this Agreement shall not prevent Buyer from seeking any remedies (at law or in
equity) against any other Party for that Party’s breach of any of the terms of this Agreement prior to the date of
termination.
11.20 Waiver of Rights. No failure on the part of Buyer to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of Buyer in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or
partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. Buyer shall not be deemed to have waived any claim available
to Buyer arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy of Buyer under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument
duly executed and delivered on behalf of Buyer; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect
except in the specific instance in which it is given.

2.2 Representations and Warranties of the Rollover Holders. To induce Parent to issue the Rollover Interests as
herein provided, each Rollover Holder makes the following representations and warranties to Parent, each and all of
which shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and the Contribution Closing:
(a) To the extent that such Rollover Holder is an organization, such Rollover Holder is duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation. Such Rollover Holder has all
requisite power and capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Partnership Agreement (or a joinder
thereto). Such Rollover Holder has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and shall execute and deliver
the Partnership Agreement at the Contribution Closing. This Agreement is, and once executed by such Rollover
Holder the Partnership Agreement shall be, valid and binding obligations of such Rollover Holder enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument in
connection herewith by such Rollover Holder, nor the acquisition of the Rollover Interests hereunder, will (i)
violate, conflict with or result in a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration)
under any agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to which such Rollover Holder is a party or by
which any of such Rollover Holder’s assets is bound, except for such defaults (or rights of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) as to which requisite waivers or consents have been obtained and are in full force
and effect, or (ii) violate any law, order, writ, injunction or decree applicable to such Rollover Holder.
(c) Immediately prior to the Contribution Closing such Rollover Holder will be the record and beneficial
owner of the Contributed Shares set forth opposite such Rollover Holder’s name on Schedule I hereto free and
clear of all Liens (other than restrictions on transfer under applicable securities laws). No other Person has any
right to acquire the Contributed Shares. Upon transfer of such Contributed Shares to Parent at the time of the
Contribution Closing, Parent shall acquire good and valid title to such Contributed Shares, free and clear of any
and all Liens, other than any such Liens created by Parent, under applicable securities laws or under the
Partnership Agreement.
(d) Such Rollover Holder has not incurred or become liable for any broker’s commission or finder’s fee
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
F-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(e) Such Rollover Holder is acquiring the Rollover Interests for such Rollover Holder’s account, for
investment and not with a view to the sale or distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of distributing
or selling the same. Such Rollover Holder acknowledges that (i) the Rollover Interests have not been registered
under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the “Securities Act”) or any securities or “blue sky” laws of
any state, and, consequently, the materials relating to the offer have not been subject to review and comment by
the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental authority, (ii) there is not now
and there may never be any public market for the Rollover Interests and (iii) Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act is not presently available with respect to the sale of any Rollover Interests. None of the Rollover
Interests may be offered, sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise assigned unless such the
Rollover Interests are registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available, in
each case in accordance with any applicable securities or “blue sky” laws of any state, and then only in
accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement.
(f) Such Rollover Holder has had an opportunity to ask such questions as he or it has deemed necessary
of, and to receive answers from, representatives of Parent concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of
the Rollover Interests and the merits and risks of investing in the Rollover Interests and has had full access to
such other information concerning Parent, its Subsidiaries and the Rollover Interests as such Rollover Holder
has requested. Such Rollover Holder’s knowledge and experience in financial and business matters is such that
it is capable of evaluating the merits and risk of the investment in the Rollover Interests. In furtherance of the
foregoing, such Rollover Holder represents and warrants that (i) no representation or warranty, express or
implied, whether written or oral, as to the financial condition, results of operations, prospects, properties or
business of Parent or any of its Affiliates or as to the desirability or value of an investment in Parent has been
made to such Rollover Holder by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates and (ii) such Rollover Holder has
relied upon his or its own independent appraisal and investigation, and the advice of such Rollover Holder’s
own counsel, tax advisors and other advisors, regarding the risks of an investment in Parent.
(g) Such Rollover Holder’s financial situation is such that such Rollover Holder can afford to bear the
economic risk of holding the Rollover Interests for an indefinite period and such Rollover Holder can afford to
suffer the complete loss of such Rollover Holder’s investment in the Rollover Interests.
(h) Such Rollover Holder is not subscribing for the Rollover Interests as a result of or subsequent to any
advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspapers, magazine or similar media or
broadcast over television or radio, or presented at any seminar or meeting, or any solicitation of a subscription
by a person or entity not previously known to such Rollover Holder in connection with investments in
securities generally.
(i) Such Rollover Holder hereby represents and warrants as to such Rollover Holder’s status by completing
the Accredited Investor Questionnaire attached hereto as Exhibit B.
(j) Such Rollover Holder’s principal place of residence is in the country or state so designated below his or
its name on the signature page hereto.
(k) Such Rollover Holder understands that federal regulations and executive orders administered by the
United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) prohibit, among other
things, the engagement in transactions with, and the provision of services to, certain foreign countries,
territories, entities and individuals. Such Rollover Holder represents and warrants that he or it is not a person
named on an OFAC list, nor is such Rollover Holder a person with whom dealings are prohibited under any
OFAC regulation.

the other parties hereto, except that Parent may, without the consent of any other party hereto,
F-6
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(i) transfer or assign this Agreement, or its respective rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from
time to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time, (ii) transfer or assign its respective rights hereunder for
collateral security purposes to any lender providing financing to Parent or Merger Sub, and (iii) after the Effective

5.3 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions, taken as a whole, is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.
5.4 Remedies. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms, provisions and
covenants contained herein in any court set forth in Section 5.10, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (a) the other party (or parties) has (or have) an adequate
remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.
5.5 Non-Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or any document, certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith or otherwise, each
party hereto acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its respective Related Persons, that all Actions that
may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out of, by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to (a)

other Transaction Document and (d) the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, in each case may be made
only against (and are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto or thereto, as
applicable (other than claims by Parent against the insurers under any buy side representations and warranty
insurance policy obtained by Parent or any of its Affiliates). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each party hereto acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its respective Related Persons, that no recourse
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or in connection with any Transactions shall be sought or
had against any such other Person and no such other Person shall have any Liabilities (whether in contract or in tort,
in law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine) of any
nature whatsoever arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the items in the preceding
clauses (a) through (d), it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability or Liabilities
whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any direct or indirect, past, present or future
shareholder, equity holder, controlling person, member, partner (limited or general), manager, director, officer,
employee, lender, financing source (including, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub, Sponsor and their respective
Affiliates, the Debt Financing Sources), Affiliate, agent or other Representative of any party hereto or any Affiliate of
any party hereto, through Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, its Subsidiaries or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a
claim by or on behalf of any party hereto, as applicable, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings, by virtue of any law, or otherwise, except for (i) claims
against any Person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and conditions of, the applicable Transaction

Document(s), (ii) claims of fraud, (iii) claims against any Person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the, the Confidentiality Agreement, and (iv) claims Parent or Merger Sub may, in their sole discretion,
assert against the Debt Financing Sources pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter.

shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby regardless of any investigation made by, or on behalf of, any Party.
5.7 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument or
instruments in writing signed by each party hereto. Any party hereto may, only by an instrument in writing, waive
compliance by any other party or parties hereto with any term or provision hereof on the part of such other party or
parties hereto to be performed or complied with. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any term or
provision hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. The rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have hereunder.
5.8 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person not a party hereto.
5.9 Exhibits and Schedules. The Schedules and Exhibits hereto are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and

5.10 Governing Law.
(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules or other rules that would result in the application of the
laws of a different jurisdiction. Any and all claims, controversies, causes of action, or other Actions arising out
or relating to this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute, shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflicts of law rules or other rules that would result in the
application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.
(b) The parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, relating to, or in
connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought exclusively in the Delaware Chancery
Court or, if such court shall not have or declines jurisdiction, any federal court or other Delaware state courts, in
each case, located in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (collectively, the “Chosen Courts”), and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such Chosen Courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action
in any such Chosen Court or that any such Action brought in any such Chosen Court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in Section 5.1 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.
(c) To the extent that any party hereto has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any
court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in
aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to himself, herself or itself, or to such Person’s property,
each such party hereto hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of such Person’s obligations with
respect to this Agreement.
(d) Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY
F-8
TABLE OF CONTENTS
MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING OR OTHER ACTION ARISING OUT OF,
RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS,
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) SUCH PARTY HERETO
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) SUCH PARTY HERETO
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (d) SUCH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH TRANSACTION DOCUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 5.10(d).
5.11 Interpretation; Absence of Presumption
(a) For the purposes hereof: (i) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa and
words of one gender shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires; (ii) the terms “hereof”,
“herein”, and “herewith” and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole (including all of the Schedules and Exhibits) and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, and Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule references are to the Articles, Sections,
paragraphs, Exhibits, and Schedules to this Agreement unless otherwise specified; (iii) the word “including” and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall mean “including, without limitation”, unless the
context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified; and (iv) the word “or” shall not be exclusive. Further,
prior drafts of this Agreement or the fact that any clauses have been added, deleted or otherwise modified from
any prior drafts of this Agreement shall not be used as an aid of construction or otherwise constitute evidence
of the intent of the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party hereto by virtue of such prior drafts.
(b) With regard to each and every term and condition of this Agreement, the parties hereto understand and
agree that the same have or has been mutually negotiated, prepared and drafted, and if at any time the parties
hereto desire or are required to interpret or construe any such term or condition, no consideration will be given
to the issue of which party hereto actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or condition of this
Agreement.
5.12 Intended Tax Treatment. No Party shall, and Parent shall not permit Bullseye TopCo, Inc. or any of its
controlled Affiliates to, take a position for U.S. federal (or applicable state and local) income tax purposes that is
inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment, unless required by applicable law, and each Party shall prepare and file
all tax returns in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment.
5.13 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument, it
being understood and agreed that the parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the
extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic
Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed (including
by electronic signature) by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed (including by electronic signature) by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and
no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or
other communication). No party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as
a defense to the formation of a contract, and each party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such
defense relates to lack of authenticity.
5.14 Further Action. The Parties hereto shall execute and deliver all documents, provide all information, and take
or refrain from taking such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.

to the Rollover Holders, each and all of which shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and the

(a) Parent has full limited partnership power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement. Parent

enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,

2.2 Representations and Warranties of the Rollover Holders. To induce Parent to issue the Rollover Interests as
herein provided, each Rollover Holder makes the following representations and warranties to Parent, each and all of
which shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and the Contribution Closing:
(a) Such Rollover Holder is duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation. Such Rollover Holder has all requisite power and capacity to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the Partnership Agreement (or a joinder thereto). Such Rollover Holder has duly executed
and delivered this Agreement, and shall execute and deliver the Partnership Agreement at the Contribution
Closing. This Agreement is, and once executed by such Rollover Holder the Partnership Agreement shall be,
valid and binding obligations of such Rollover Holder enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and except as
enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument in
connection herewith by such Rollover Holder, nor the acquisition of the Rollover Interests hereunder, will (i)
violate, conflict with or result in a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration)
under any agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to which such Rollover Holder is a party or by
which any of such Rollover Holder’s assets is bound, except for such defaults (or rights of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) as to which requisite waivers or consents have been obtained and are in full force
and effect, or (ii) violate any law, order, writ, injunction or decree applicable to such Rollover Holder.
(c) Immediately prior to the Contribution Closing such Rollover Holder will be the record and beneficial
owner of the Contributed Shares set forth opposite such Rollover Holder’s name on Schedule I hereto free and
clear of all Liens (other than restrictions on transfer under applicable securities laws). No other Person has any
right to acquire the Contributed Shares. Upon transfer of such Contributed Shares to Parent at the time of the
Contribution Closing, Parent shall acquire good and valid title to such Contributed Shares, free and clear of any
and all Liens, other than any such Liens created by Parent, under applicable securities laws or under the
Partnership Agreement.
(d) Such Rollover Holder has not incurred or become liable for any broker’s commission or finder’s fee
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(e) Such Rollover Holder is acquiring the Rollover Interests for such Rollover Holder’s account, for
investment and not with a view to the sale or distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of
G-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
distributing or selling the same. Such Rollover Holder acknowledges that (i) the Rollover Interests have not
been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the “Securities Act”) or any securities or
“blue sky” laws of any state, and, consequently, the materials relating to the offer have not been subject to
review and comment by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental
authority, (ii) there is not now and there may never be any public market for the Rollover Interests and (iii) Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act is not presently available with respect to the sale of any Rollover
Interests. None of the Rollover Interests may be offered, sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
assigned unless such the Rollover Interests are registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities or “blue sky” laws of any
state, and then only in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement.
(f) Such Rollover Holder has had an opportunity to ask such questions as he or it has deemed necessary
of, and to receive answers from, representatives of Parent concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of
the Rollover Interests and the merits and risks of investing in the Rollover Interests and has had full access to
such other information concerning Parent, its Subsidiaries and the Rollover Interests as such Rollover Holder
has requested. Such Rollover Holder’s knowledge and experience in financial and business matters is such that
it is capable of evaluating the merits and risk of the investment in the Rollover Interests. In furtherance of the
foregoing, such Rollover Holder represents and warrants that (i) no representation or warranty, express or
implied, whether written or oral, as to the financial condition, results of operations, prospects, properties or
business of Parent or any of its Affiliates or as to the desirability or value of an investment in Parent has been
made to such Rollover Holder by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates and (ii) such Rollover Holder has
relied upon its own independent appraisal and investigation, and the advice of such Rollover Holder’s own
counsel, tax advisors and other advisors, regarding the risks of an investment in Parent.
(g) Such Rollover Holder’s financial situation is such that such Rollover Holder can afford to bear the
economic risk of holding the Rollover Interests for an indefinite period and such Rollover Holder can afford to
suffer the complete loss of such Rollover Holder’s investment in the Rollover Interests.
(h) Such Rollover Holder is not subscribing for the Rollover Interests as a result of or subsequent to any
advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspapers, magazine or similar media or
broadcast over television or radio, or presented at any seminar or meeting, or any solicitation of a subscription
by a person or entity not previously known to such Rollover Holder in connection with investments in
securities generally.
(i) Such Rollover Holder hereby represents and warrants as to such Rollover Holder’s status by completing
the Accredited Investor Questionnaire attached hereto as Exhibit B.
(j) Such Rollover Holder’s principal place of residence is in the country or state so designated below its
name on the signature page hereto.
(k) Such Rollover Holder understands that federal regulations and executive orders administered by the
United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) prohibit, among other
things, the engagement in transactions with, and the provision of services to, certain foreign countries,
territories, entities and individuals. Such Rollover Holder represents and warrants that he or it is not a person
named on an OFAC list, nor is such Rollover Holder a person with whom dealings are prohibited under any
OFAC regulation.

remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

corporate, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine) of any
nature whatsoever arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the items in the preceding

Affiliates, the Debt Financing Sources), Affiliate, agent or other Representative of any party hereto or any Affiliate of

instruments in writing signed by each party hereto. Any party hereto may, only by an instrument in writing, waive
compliance by any other party or parties hereto with any term or provision hereof on the part of such
G-7
TABLE OF CONTENTS
other party or parties hereto to be performed or complied with. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right
or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any term or
provision hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. The rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have hereunder.

CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) SUCH PARTY HERETO MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (d) SUCH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
AND EACH TRANSACTION DOCUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND

no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or
other communication). No party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as
a defense to the formation of a contract, and each party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such
defense relates to lack of authenticity.

or refrain from taking such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.
5.16 Termination. This Agreement shall terminate automatically and shall be of no further force and effect in the
event the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms; provided that the parties hereto shall
give effect to the provisions of Section 1.3.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:
AGREEMENT
1. Restrictive Covenants.
(a) Non-Disclosure.
(i) The Restricted Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (as defined below) not to,
disclose any Confidential Information (as defined below), in whole or in part, to any other Person, or use
the Confidential Information for their own account or for the benefit of any other Person, in each case,

H-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
(iii) If any of the Restricted Parties or their respective Affiliates or representatives are compelled or
required by, or requested in connection with, Applicable Law or other legal process, or by a bank
regulatory authority, to disclose any Confidential Information, the applicable Restricted Party shall, to the
extent legally permitted under Applicable Law, notify Parent, as promptly as practicable, of such request or
requirement so that Parent may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement, and/or take any other mutually agreed action. Such Restricted Party, to the
extent so reasonably requested by Parent shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in any actions they may
choose to take in seeking to prevent or limit disclosure. If, in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver hereunder, any of the Restricted Parties or their respective Affiliates or representatives
are compelled or required by Applicable Law or other legal process, or by a bank regulatory authority, to
disclose any Confidential Information, such Restricted Party and such Affiliates and representatives may
disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which it or they are advised by outside counsel
is legally required to be disclosed, and such Restricted Party (or such Affiliates or representatives, as
applicable) will exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information; provided, that such disclosure shall not change the status of
such information as Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Restricted Parties and
their respective Affiliates and representatives shall not be required to give notice to Parent or to comply
with any other obligations of this Section 1(a)(iii), and shall not be prohibited from disclosing Confidential
Information to a regulatory authority, self-regulatory authority, bank examiner or stock exchange in
connection with a routine inquiry by such regulatory authority, self-regulatory authority, bank examiner or
stock exchange not targeting any of the Group Companies (or targeting any of the Group Companies to the
extent providing such notice is not legally permitted).
(b) Employee Non-Solicit/Hire. During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the three-year
anniversary thereof, the Restricted Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, either on behalf of any Restricted Party or on behalf of any other
Person, solicit for employment or engagement or employ or engage (as an independent contractor) any senior-
level employees (to be defined as those employees with the title of Vice-President or any other, senior title) of
any of the Group Companies; provided, that the Restricted Parties shall not be restricted from (x) soliciting for
employment or engagement any such employees pursuant to general solicitations (whether through
advertisements on any medium or through the efforts of a search firm or otherwise) of employment or
engagement not specifically directed at such Persons (so long as no such employee is hired or engaged as a
result thereof), or (y) soliciting for employment or engagement or employing or engaging any such employees
whose employment or engagement was terminated by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including following the
Closing, any Group Company) at least twelve (12) months prior to solicitation or hiring. Flint Lane hereby
represents and warrants that there are no independent contractors of any of the Group Companies (i) performing
services of an employee that would be performed by an employee of any of the Group Companies with the title
of Vice-President or any other, senior title or (b) who have contributed, or who are contributing, in any material
respect to the intellectual property of any of the Group Companies.
(c) Business Non-Solicit. During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the three-year
anniversary thereof, no Restricted Party shall, directly or indirectly, (A) for any Restricted Party or on behalf of
any other Person, solicit or otherwise attempt to take away any supplier, vendor, customer or other material
business relation of any of the Group Companies who any Restricted Party solicited, did business with or
received confidential, proprietary or trade secret information with respect to, on behalf of any of the Group
Companies or with whom any Restricted Party otherwise became acquainted as a result of any Restricted Party’s
or his or its Affiliates’ management of or service to any of the Group Companies; or (B) assist or encourage any
other Person in carrying out, directly or indirectly, any activity that would be prohibited by this Section 1(c) if
such activity was carried out by any Restricted Party, either directly or indirectly, and in particular the Restricted
Parties shall not, directly or indirectly, induce any employee of any of the Group Companies to carry out, directly
or indirectly, any such activity. Parent may at any time provide notice of the existence of this Agreement to any

control, lend money, render financial or other assistance to, or participate in or be connected with, as an
officer, director, manager, agent, employee, partner, shareholder, consultant, trustee or otherwise, any
Person that is engaged in the Restricted Business in the Restricted Area. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

Companies conducted as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date and (b) any proposed or planned
business of the Group Companies set forth in any written business plan or document created or updated

anniversary thereof, (i) the Restricted Parties shall not disparage, defame or discredit (x) any of the Group
Companies or (y) Parent or any of its Affiliates, in the case of clause (y), solely to the extent related to their
ownership of the Group Companies, or engage in any activity which would have the effect of disparaging,
defaming or discrediting (x) any Group Company or (y) Parent or any of its Affiliates, in the case of clause (y),
solely to the extent related to their ownership of the Group Companies, nor shall the Restricted Parties interfere
with or disrupt the business activities of any Group Company, or engage in any activity which would have the
effect of interfering with or disrupting the business activities of any Group Company and (ii) no Group Company
or Parent shall disparage, defame or discredit the Restricted Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, or
engage in any activity which would have the effect of disparaging, defaming or discrediting the Restricted
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 1(e) or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall prevent the Restricted Parties, Parent or any member of any Group Company from
engaging in “whistleblowing” or other activities expressly protected by applicable law, to the extent so
protected.
(f) Tolling. If it shall be judicially determined by final, non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction that any Restricted Party has violated any of his obligations under this Section 1 then the applicable
restricted period shall automatically be extended by a period of time equal in length to the period during which
such violation(s) occurred, effective as of the date of such Restricted Party’s first breach of any provision.
(g) Remedies. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. The Restricted Parties
acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach (or threatened breach) of the provisions of this Section
1, Parent shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction set forth
in Section 11.08 of the Merger Agreement in order to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (without any requirement to post any bond or other
security in connection with seeking such relief), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled hereunder, at law or in equity. The Parties agree not to raise
H-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
of this Agreement by any Restricted Party and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the Parties under this Agreement.
(h) Acknowledgments. The Restricted Parties acknowledge that the value of the Confidential Information
arises from the fact that such information is not generally known in the marketplace and that the covenants set
forth in this Section 1 are additional consideration for the agreements and covenants of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement and are a material inducement to the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement and to perform their respective obligations thereunder.
Furthermore, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the protection of Confidential Information and
employees of any of the Group Companies are each necessary to protect and preserve the value of each of the
Group Companies’ business and their respective assets and properties. The Parties acknowledge that (i) the
covenants and agreements of the Restricted Parties set forth in this Section 1 are reasonable with respect to
their duration and scope, (ii) Parent will be irreparably harmed and there will be no adequate remedy at law for a
violation of any of such covenants and agreements, (iii) such covenants and agreements are reasonable and
necessary for the protection and preservation of the value and the goodwill of the business of each of the
Group Companies, Parent and their respective Affiliates, and (iv) Parent would not have agreed to consummate
the Transactions unless the Restricted Parties agreed to be bound by the terms of this Section 1.
(i) Severability; Enforcement. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting
the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If, at
the time of enforcement of any of the provisions of this Section ​1, a court of competent jurisdiction set forth in
Section 11.08 of the Merger Agreement determines that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under the
circumstances then existing, then such court shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic
area of any such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision in Section ​1 with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable against the Restricted Parties as so modified to the greatest extent permissible.
(j) Representations and Warranties. As a material inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement, each
Restricted Party hereby represents and warrants that (i) to the extent that the Restricted Party is an organization,
such Restricted Party is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of organization, and the execution, delivery and performance by such Restricted Party of this Agreement are
within such Restricted Party’s entity or other powers, as applicable, (ii) to the extent that the Restricted Party is
an individual, the execution, delivery and performance by such Restricted Party of this Agreement are within
such Restricted Party’s power, authority and legal capacity, (iii) this Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by such Restricted Party, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent, constitutes or will constitute the valid and binding agreement of such Restricted Party enforceable
against such Restricted Party in accordance with its terms and conditions, and (iv) the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by such Restricted Party does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and performance of the obligations hereunder, will not conflict with or result in a violation or breach of
or default under any provision of, or constitute an event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would result
in a breach or violation of or conflict or default under any Contract or Applicable Law binding upon or
applicable to such Restricted Party or any of his or its assets or properties or, if applicable, any organization
document of such Restricted Party and (iv) the restrictions contained herein do not preclude such Restricted
Party from earning a livelihood, nor do they unreasonably impose limitations on such Restricted Party’s ability
to earn a livelihood.
2. Disclosure of this Restrictive Covenant Agreement. Each Restricted Party hereby expressly agrees to provide
a copy of this Agreement to any individual or entity with whom or which such Restricted Party is seeking to work (as
an employee, independent contractor, consultant, or in any other capacity) at any time during the period commencing
at the Closing and ending on the five-year anniversary thereof before the commencement

further specifically authorizes the Company to, in its sole discretion and without further permission from such
Restricted Party, furnish copies of the Agreement to any client or prospective client of the Company and indicate that

together with available cash of the Company that Parent directs to be deposited with the Exchange Agent
immediately following the Effective Time, is equal to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates

name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person

related fee letter (subject, in either case, to redaction of all “market flex”, pricing terms, pricing caps and other
commercially sensitive or economic terms; provided that Parent represents and warrants that the market flex and any
other redacted provisions in such fee letter do not require the imposition of (or otherwise impose) any new
conditions (or modification or expansion of any existing conditions) in the debt commitment letter or to the
consummation of the Debt Financing), as each of the foregoing may be amended, supplemented, replaced,
substituted, terminated or otherwise modified or waived from time to time after the date hereof in compliance with
Section 8.09, the “Debt Commitment Letters”) from the Debt Financing Sources party thereto, confirming their
respective commitments to provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereto, Parent with debt financing
in connection with the Transactions in the amount set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (the “Debt Financing”)

forth therein (the “Equity Financing” and together with the Debt Financing, the “Financing”).
(b) As of the date hereof, the Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding
obligation of Parent and the other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and the other parties thereto in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity). As of the date
hereof, each of the Debt Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy,

modification, withdrawal or rescission of the Financing Commitment Letters is contemplated (other than
amendments or modifications to the Debt Commitment Letters solely to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of

reasonably expected to materially adversely affect the availability of any portion of the Financing and which do
not adversely impact the conditionality or amount of the Financing). As of the date hereof, assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, Parent has no reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will not

and (B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, such
Intervening Event would nevertheless necessitate the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change, and, in
either case, the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Delaware law.
(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means any bona
fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (that is not made as a result of a breach of this Section 6.03) after the date
of this Agreement, which the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after considering the advice of, in the
case of financial matters, its financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, and outside legal counsel, to
be (i) more favorable to the holders of Shares from a financial point of view than the Merger (taking into account
all of the terms and conditions, including any financing condition or the reliability of any debt or equity funding
commitment, of, the identity of the Third Party making, the likelihood of completion of, such Acquisition
Proposal and any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation and this
Agreement (including, if applicable at the time of such determination, any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement then proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise that, if accepted by the Company,
would be binding upon Parent)), and (ii) reasonably likely to be capable of being completed, in each case taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal that the Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) considers relevant; provided, that for the purposes of this definition of “Superior Proposal”,
references to 15% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to 50%.
(f) Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and the Company’s officers and directors to, and shall instruct its and its Subsidiaries’ respective
other Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives conducted prior to the date
hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. To the extent that it has not done so prior to the date hereof,
the Company shall promptly request that each Third Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement
with the Company within the 12-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of
any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.",148,150

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the

BTRS Holdings Inc._20221110_DEFM14A_20444054_4544754.Pdf,Employee Matters,"Employee Matters.
(a) On and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) to honor the obligations of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries under the Employee Plans,
provided that nothing herein shall prevent Parent from terminating or modifying any Employee Plan in
accordance with its terms.
(b) For the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the 12 month anniversary of the Closing,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause its controlled Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide,
each Continuing Employee with (i) a base salary, wage or commission rate and annual cash bonus opportunities,
in each case, that is at least equal to the base salary, wage or commission rate and annual cash bonus
opportunities, provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) health, welfare, retirement and other employee benefits (excluding (A) any defined
benefit pension benefits, (B) retiree health benefits, (C) equity or equity based incentives, and (D) transaction,
retention, or change in control bonuses) that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the health,
welfare, retirement and other employee benefits (excluding (A) any defined benefit pension benefits, (B) retiree
health benefits, (C) equity or equity based incentives, and (D) transaction, retention, or change in control
bonuses) provided by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Closing and (iii) severance protections and benefits that are no less favorable than those provided under
the plans and programs listed or described in Section 7.05(b)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
“Severance Plans”).
(c) Without limiting the other provisions in this Section 7.05, to the extent the Closing occurs prior to the
date on which annual bonuses in respect of the 2022 fiscal year (the “2022 Bonuses”) are normally paid, the
Company will pay the 2022 Bonuses (and Parent will cause the Company to pay the 2022 Bonuses) at the same
time annual bonuses would have otherwise been paid in the ordinary course of business; provided that to the
extent that after the Effective Time but prior to the time 2022 Bonuses are paid to other Continuing Employees,
any Continuing Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company without “cause” in a manner that entitles
the Continuing Employee to severance benefits under the Severance Plans, Parent shall pay such Continuing
Employee their Pro Rata Bonus Amount at the time 2022 Bonuses are paid to other Continuing Employees. For
the purposes of this Section 7.05(c), “Pro Rata Bonus Amount” means (A) if the Continuing Employee would
have been entitled to a 2022 Bonus at the time that 2022 Bonuses are paid given the Company’s performance
against applicable budgets and targets as of the Continuing Employee’s termination date (the “Potential
Bonus”), the Potential Bonus multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
applicable fiscal year through the Continuing Employee’s termination date and the denominator of which is 365
and (B) if the Continuing Employee would not have been entitled to a 2022 Bonus at the time that 2022 Bonuses
are paid given the Company’s performance against applicable budgets and targets as of the Continuing
Employee’s termination date, $0.

or its controlled Affiliates, excluding any defined benefit or retiree health and welfare plans, in which any
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate on or after the Closing, for all purposes, including eligibility,
vesting and benefit accrual purposes, such Continuing Employee’s service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing shall be treated as service with Parent and its Affiliates to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any analogous
Employee Plan; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that it would result in any duplication
of benefits for the same period of service or such service was not credited under the corresponding Employee
Plan.
(e) With respect to any health and welfare benefit plans (excluding any retiree health and welfare plans)
plan maintained by Parent or its controlled Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate
on or after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to (i)
waive, or cause to be waived, preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods with respect to participation by and coverage of the Continuing Employees to the same extent
such preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods and (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred
A-42TABLE OF CONTENTS
by each Continuing Employee during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying
such year’s deductible and co-payment limitations to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, prior to the Closing, to recognition of such co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses under any
Employee Plan.
(f) Nothing in this Section 7.05, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto, including any current or former Service Provider, Company Employee or Continuing
Employee, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall
establish, or constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking to amend, establish,
terminate or modify, any Employee Plan or other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) shall alter
or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or (iv) shall create any
obligation on the part of Parent or its Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) to employ or engage any Service Provider for any period following the Effective Time.
Section 7.06. R&W Insurance Policy. If Parent or any of its controlled Affiliates determines to procure an R&W
Insurance Policy, Parent shall ensure that the R&W Insurance Policy expressly provides that (i) the insurers shall
have no, and shall specifically and irrevocably waive and agree not to pursue any and all, claims or other recovery
against the Company and its Affiliates, and any of their respective current, former or future direct or indirect equity
holders, managers, members, officers, directors, partners and employees of any of the foregoing and their successors
and assigns (“Seller Parties”) in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, except in
the case of actual common law fraud by such Seller Party, and (ii) such Seller Parties are third-party beneficiaries of
such waiver. Parent shall not and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to amend the R&W Insurance Policy in any
respect that would have the effect of altering the provisions referred to in the immediately preceding sentence
without the consent of the Company and the Seller Party against whom such amendment will be effective.

I, THE UNDERSIGNED, Chief Executive Officer of BTRS Holdings, Inc., do hereby certify as follows:
1.
The name of the corporation is BTRS Holdings, Inc. (the “Corporation”).
2.
The original Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State

time to time amended (the “DGCL”), this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been (a)
duly proposed by resolutions adopted and declared advisable by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
and (b) approved by unanimous written consent of the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the DGCL.
4.
Pursuant to Section 103(d) of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will
become effective upon filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
5.
The text of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended and restated to read in its
entirety as follows:
FIRST: The name of the corporation is BTRS Holdings, Inc. (the “Corporation”).
SECOND: The address of the Corporation’s registered office in the State of Delaware is Corporation Trust
Center, 1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801. The name of its registered
agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.
THIRD: The purpose or purposes of the Corporation shall be to engage in any lawful acts or activities for which
corporations may be organized under the DGCL.
FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation is authorized to issue is fifteen million
(15,000,000) shares of Class 1 Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Common Stock”). The number of authorized
shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) from time to time by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the
Corporation’s then outstanding shares of stocked entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class,
irrespective of the provisions of Sections 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of
the holders of any Common Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.
FIFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, subject to any limitations contained
in this Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board of Directors”), but any bylaws adopted by the Board of

other law of the State of Delaware is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article Eighth to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law as so

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Article Eighth by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director
of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any director of the Corporation with respect to
any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to, such repeal or modification.
NINTH: The following indemnification provisions shall apply to the persons enumerated below.
1. Right to Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (an
“Indemnified Person”) who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of
the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
limited liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by
such Indemnified Person in such Proceeding. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise
provided in Section 3 of this Article Ninth, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person
in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnified Person only if the
commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Indemnified Person was authorized in advance by
the Board of Directors.
2. Prepayment of Expenses of Directors and Officers. The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including
attorneys’ fees) incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the
final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnified Person
to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to
be indemnified under this Article Ninth or otherwise.
3. Claims by Directors and Officers. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
Article Ninth is not paid in full within 30 days after a written claim therefor by the Indemnified Person has been
received by the Corporation, the Indemnified Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim
and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any
such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to the
requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.
4. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may indemnify and advance expenses to
any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding by
reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is or was an
employee or agent of the Corporation or, while an employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorney’s fees)
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding. The ultimate determination of
entitlement to indemnification of persons who are non-director or officer employees or agents shall be made in
such manner as is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding initiated
by such person if the Proceeding was not authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.
5. Advancement of Expenses of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may pay the expenses (including
attorney’s fees) incurred by an employee or agent in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Board of Directors.
6. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Article Ninth shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or any agreement, or pursuant to a vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise. The Corporation acknowledges that certain persons entitled to
indemnification from the Corporation hereunder may have certain rights to certain rights to indemnification,

TABLE OF CONTENTS
advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by a stockholder of the Corporation or certain affiliates of
such stockholder (collectively, the “Secondary Indemnitors”). The Corporation hereby agrees (i) that it is the
indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to such persons are primary and any obligation of the Secondary
Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by
such persons are secondary), (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by
such persons and shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts
paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by this Certificate of Incorporation (or any
other agreement between the Corporation and such person), without regard to any rights such person may have
against the Secondary Indemnitors, and (iii) that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Secondary
Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Secondary Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any
other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Corporation further agrees that no advancement or payment
by the Secondary Indemnitors on behalf of such person with respect to any claim for which such person has
sought indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the Secondary Indemnitors shall
have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the
rights of recovery of such person against the Corporation. The Corporation and such persons agree that the
Secondary Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section 6.
7. Other Indemnification. The Corporation’s obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is
serving at its request as a director, officer or employee of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust, organization or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person may
collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust,
organization or other enterprise.
