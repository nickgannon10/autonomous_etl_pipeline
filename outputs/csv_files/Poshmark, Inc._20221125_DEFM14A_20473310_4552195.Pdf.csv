Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) delivered its opinion to the Poshmark Board that, as of October 3, 2022, and based upon and subject
to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $17.90 in cash per share of Poshmark common stock to be paid to the holders (other than NAVER and
its affiliates) of shares of Poshmark common stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to
such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated October 3, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services
and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Poshmark Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion
is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Poshmark common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Pursuant

the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $35.2 million, $400,000 of which became payable in cash in quarterly
installments with the first installment being payable three months following the date of the engagement letter, and the remainder of which is contingent
upon consummation of the Merger.

Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, Poshmark stockholders who continuously hold shares of Poshmark common stock through the Effective
Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their
demands, and who otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of
Poshmark common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. The “fair value” of shares of Poshmark common stock as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be greater than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration that stockholders would
otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of Poshmark common stock.
The right to seek appraisal will be lost if a Poshmark stockholder votes “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. However, abstaining
or voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement is not in itself sufficient to perfect appraisal rights because additional actions must also be taken to
perfect such rights. To exercise appraisal rights, Poshmark stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares must so advise
the Company by submitting a written demand for appraisal (or by electronic transmission directed to an information processing system, if any, expressly
designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal) to the Company prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, and
must otherwise strictly follow the applicable procedures and requirements prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. A person having a beneficial interest in
shares of Poshmark common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, may perfect appraisal rights in
such person’s name if such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the Effective Time and otherwise satisfies the requirements
applicable to stockholders of record under Section 262(a) of the DGCL. In addition, the beneficial owner must (1) reasonably identify in his, her or its
demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (2) provide documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial
ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (3) provide an address at which such
beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the verified list of persons who have demanded appraisal for
their shares pursuant to Section 262(f) of the DGCL. In addition, under Section 262 of the DGCL, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any
appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have perfected their appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds
1% of the outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock or (2) the value of the per share Merger Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares
of Poshmark common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million. In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, Poshmark stockholders that
may wish to pursue appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors.

The receipt of cash by a holder of Poshmark common stock who is a U.S. holder (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The

The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the Special Meeting and the
Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a holder of Poshmark common stock. You should
read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in
this proxy statement.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
On October 3, 2022, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Poshmark, with Poshmark surviving as an indirect subsidiary of Parent.
You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Poshmark Board in favor of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and the other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting as described in this proxy statement.
As a holder of Poshmark common stock, what will I receive in the Merger?
Each share of Poshmark common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Poshmark
common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Proton Parent and Merger Sub) immediately
prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL) will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding
taxes.
The exchange of shares of Poshmark common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a more detailed
description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You are urged to consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of how the
Merger will affect you for federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes.
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the recent trading price of Poshmark common stock?
The Merger Consideration of $17.90 per share represents a premium of approximately 15% of Poshmark’s Class A common stock closing share price
on October 3, 2022, the date of the transaction announcement, a 34% premium to the 30-day volume weighted average price of Poshmark’s Class A
common stock as of October 3, 2022 (“VWAP”), and a 48% premium to the 90-day VWAP. On November 21, 2022, the most recent practicable date before
the filing of this proxy statement, the closing price of Poshmark common stock was $17.78 per share.
What will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the Merger and purchase rights under the 2021 ESPP?
At the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option to purchase shares of Company Class A common stock or Class B common stock (a
“Company Option”) that is vested (including such Company Options that vest in accordance with their terms as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) (a “Vested Company Option”) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price
per share less than $17.90 will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to
such Vested Company Option
 
-11-Table of Contents
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option. At the Effective Time, each
Company Option that is not a Vested Company Option and is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise
price per share less than the Merger Consideration (an “Unvested Company Option”) will be automatically cancelled and converted into a contingent right
to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such Unvested Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Unvested Company Option (the “Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts”), which Cash Replacement
Company Option Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent or its affiliates through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be
payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option for which the Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts is exchanged would have vested
pursuant to its terms. All Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts will have the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as
applied to the Unvested Company Option for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Merger or for such
other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of
the Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts. At the Effective Time, each Company Option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than
Merger Consideration will be cancelled automatically for no consideration.
At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units (“Company RSUs”) of the Company that is vested and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time or that vests in accordance with its terms as a result of the consummation of the Merger (a “Vested Company RSU”) will be
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to
the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total number of shares of Company Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to
such Vested Company RSU. At the Effective Time, other than as set forth in “New Arrangements with Company Executive Officers” below, each award of
Company RSUs that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a Vested Company RSU (an “Unvested Company RSU”) will be
automatically cancelled and converted into a contingent right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes)
equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total number of shares of Company Class A common stock or Class B common stock
subject to such Unvested Company RSU (the “Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts”), which Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts will,
subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent or its affiliates through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the
Unvested Company RSU for which such Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms. All Cash
Replacement Company RSU Amounts will have the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as applied to the Unvested Company
RSU for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Merger or for such other administrative or ministerial changes
as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement Company RSU
Amounts.
No later than three business days prior to the Effective Time, each purchase right outstanding as of October 3, 2022, under the Poshmark, Inc. 2021
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2021 ESPP”) will be exercised, with accumulated contributions used to purchase shares of Company Class A
common stock in accordance with the terms of the 2021 ESPP on such final exercise date. All shares of Company Class A common stock purchased on
such final exercise date shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The 2021 ESPP will be terminated effective as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

•
a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Merger Proposal”); and
 
•
a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are

-13-
Table of Contents
Pursuant to Poshmark’s Amended and Restated By-Laws, the only business that will be transacted at the Special Meeting are the Merger Proposal
and the Adjournment Proposal, as stated in the accompanying notice of the Special Meeting.
What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the Special Meeting?
The representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The inspector of election appointed for the Special
Meeting will determine whether a quorum is present. The inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence
of a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or postponement of the
meeting to another date or time.
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares
of Poshmark common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record date. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special
Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank,
broker or other nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares
of Poshmark common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on such matter. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the
Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s
bank, broker or other nominee) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
The holders of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all proposals
described in this proxy statement. On each of the proposals presented at the Special Meeting, each holder of Class A common stock is entitled to one (1)
vote for each outstanding share of Class A common stock owned on the record date and each holder of Class B common stock is entitled to ten (10)
votes for each outstanding share of Class B common stock owned on the record date on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting.
What is a “broker non-vote”? 
If a beneficial owner of shares of Poshmark common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee does not provide the
organization that holds the owner’s shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds the owner’s shares
may generally vote on “discretionary” matters but cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks,
brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not
vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions
from the beneficial owner of relevant shares. Poshmark does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to
banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of
the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be permitted to vote
your shares of Poshmark common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to
how to vote your shares of Poshmark common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but
will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.

Table of Contents
How does the Poshmark Board recommend that I vote?
The Poshmark Board recommends a vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Poshmark Board considered in determining to recommend that Poshmark stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Poshmark Board.” In
addition, in considering the recommendation of the Poshmark Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that certain of the
Company’s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders
generally. Please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger - Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
What happens if I sell my shares of Poshmark common stock before the Special Meeting?
The record date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or transfer your shares of Poshmark common
stock after the record date, but before the Special Meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the Special Meeting. However, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred your shares. In order to receive the Merger Consideration in
connection with the Merger, you must hold your shares of Poshmark common stock through the Effective Time.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Poshmark common stock. The written document describing the matters
to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of
Poshmark common stock is called a “proxy card.”
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way
that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or
against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
How do I cast my vote if I am a stockholder of record?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered,
with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In that case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by
the Company.
If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may vote by submitting your proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by completing,
signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid reply envelope. You may also vote your shares by ballot via the Internet during the
Special Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are encouraged to submit your vote by proxy as early as possible to ensure that
your shares will be represented. For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see the section of this proxy statement
titled “The Special Meeting - Voting Procedures.”
If you are a holder of record of shares of Poshmark common stock and you submit a proxy card or voting instructions but do not direct how to vote on
each item, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares in favor of each of the Merger Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the
Adjournment Proposal.

Table of Contents
How do I cast my vote if my shares of Poshmark common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee?
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of Poshmark common stock
held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with
respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Poshmark common stock held in “street name,” you must follow the instructions from your bank, broker or
other nominee in order to vote such shares. Your bank, broker or other nominee will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by
properly completing the voting instruction form sent to you by your bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement. Without providing those
instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the
outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?
If you abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
If you fail to cast your vote via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy or fail to give voting instructions to your broker, it will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal, provided that a quorum is
present at the Special Meeting.
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or my voting instructions?
Yes. If you are a stockholder with shares of Poshmark common stock registered in your name, you may revoke your proxy at any time prior to the
time it is voted by:
 
•
filing with our Corporate Secretary a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy;
 
•
properly casting a new vote via the Internet or by telephone at any time before the closure of the Internet or telephone voting facilities
described under “The Special Meeting - Voting Procedures”;
 
•
duly completing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Secretary; or
 
•
attending the Special Meeting online and voting electronically during the meeting (although attendance at the Special Meeting will not in
and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy).
Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent so as to be delivered to our offices at Poshmark, Inc., 203 Redwood Shores
Parkway, 8th Floor, Redwood City, California 94065, Attention: General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, before the taking of the vote at the Special
Meeting. If you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or an instrument revoking the proxy to the Company, you should ensure that you
send your new proxy card or instrument revoking the proxy in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the Special Meeting.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Poshmark common stock held in “street name,” you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to
change your vote or obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares electronically at the Special Meeting.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement or multiple proxy or voting instruction
cards. For example, if you hold your shares of Poshmark common stock in
 
-16-
Table of Contents
more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares of Poshmark
common stock. If you are a holder of Poshmark common stock of record and your shares of Poshmark common stock are registered in more than one
name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please submit your proxy and/or voting instructions for each set of materials that you receive to
ensure that all your shares of Poshmark common stock are voted. 
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
If available, we may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. We intend to publish final voting results in a
Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that Poshmark files with the SEC are publicly available
when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
Am I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?
If the Merger is completed, holders of Poshmark common stock who continuously hold shares of Poshmark common stock through the Effective
Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their
demands, and who otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of
Poshmark common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of Poshmark common stock
are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
Poshmark common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the
amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the amount
determined to be the fair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding).
Holders of Poshmark common stock who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with
respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising
appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is accessible without
subscription or cost at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the section of this proxy statement
titled “Appraisal Rights.”
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
We are working toward completing the Merger as promptly as possible, and currently expect to complete the Merger by the first quarter of 2023.
However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be accurately predicted, because the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, waiver) of the conditions to Parent, Proton Parent, Merger Sub and the Company’s respective obligations to consummate the
Merger, some of which are not within the parties’ control.
What effect will the Merger have on Poshmark?
If the Merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Poshmark, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon
cease, and Poshmark will continue to exist following the Merger as an indirect subsidiary of Parent. Following completion of the Merger, Poshmark Class
A common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq, and the registration of Poshmark Class A common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated.
 
-17-
Table of Contents
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, the holders of Poshmark
common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of Poshmark common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain
an independent public company and stockholders will continue to own their shares of Poshmark common stock. The Poshmark Class A common stock
will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed and traded on Nasdaq. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed,
Poshmark may be obligated to pay to Parent a termination fee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement - Termination Fees and Expenses.”
What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary
instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder
continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. If your shares are held in “street name,” you will receive your proxy card or other
voting information from your bank, broker or other nominee and you will return your proxy card(s) to your bank, broker or other nominee. You should
vote on and sign each proxy card you receive as discussed above. To request that only one copy of any of these materials be mailed to your household,
please contact your bank, broker or other nominee.

"Poshmark, Inc._20221125_DEFM14A_20473310_4552195.Pdf",CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement, and any documents to which Poshmark refers to in this proxy statement, contains “forward-looking statements”,
which include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, such as statements regarding our expectations, intentions or strategies
regarding the future. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,”
“expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “aim,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “goal,” “can,” “seek,”
“target” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-
looking statements are based on management’s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the Company. All forward-
looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of
future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These statements are only
predictions. The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its then-current expectations and projections about future events and
financial trends as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond the Company’s control. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future
financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected and are subject to a number of
known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:
 
•
the ability of the parties to consummate the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all;
 
•
the satisfaction (or waiver) of closing conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction, including with respect to the approval
of the Company’s stockholders;
 
•
potential delays in consummation the proposed transaction;
 
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement;
 
•
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the Company’s business and
general economic conditions;
 
•
the Company’s ability to implement its business strategy;
 
•
significant transaction costs associated with the proposed transaction;
 
•
potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction;
 
•
the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm the Company’s business, including current plans and operations;
 
•
the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel;
 
•
potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed
transaction;
 
•
legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting the Company’s business;
 
•
general economic and market developments and conditions;
 
•
the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which the Company operates;
 
•
potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the Merger that could affect
the Company’s financial performance;
 
•
restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact the Company’s ability to pursue certain business
opportunities or strategic transactions;
 
-19-Table of Contents
•
unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well
as the Company’s response to any of the aforementioned factors; and
 
•
the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals.
Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking
statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and any
subsequent reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filed from time to time and available at www.sec.gov. See the section of this proxy statement
titled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.” While the list of factors presented in this proxy statement is, considered representative, no such list
should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to
the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking
statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability and similar risks, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The forward-looking statements included
herein are made only as of the date hereof. The Company does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required
by securities and other applicable laws.

As of the close of business on the record date, there were 54,649,854 shares of Class A common stock and 24,592,080 shares of Class B common

of the outstanding shares of Class A common Stock and Class B common Stock vote together as a single class on all proposals described in this proxy
statement. On each of the proposals presented at the Special Meeting, each holder of Class A common stock is entitled to one (1) vote for each
outstanding share of Class A common stock owned on the record date and each holder of Class B common stock is entitled to ten (10) votes for each
outstanding share of Class B common stock owned on the record date. The adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of Poshmark common
stock requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock entitled
to vote thereon as of the close of business on the record date.
A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for examination by any stockholder for any purpose germane to the

Quorum",32,33
"Poshmark, Inc._20221125_DEFM14A_20473310_4552195.Pdf",Quorum,"Quorum
The representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum shall fail to attend the Special Meeting, the
chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place. The inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will
determine whether a quorum is present. The inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
If a beneficial owner of shares of Poshmark common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee does not provide the
organization that holds its shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds its shares may generally vote
on “discretionary” matters but cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other
nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a
particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the
beneficial owner of relevant shares. Poshmark does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks,
brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the
proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Poshmark
common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares
of Poshmark common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or postponement of the meeting to
another date or time.

common stock owned on the record date and each holder of Class B common stock is entitled to ten (10) votes for each outstanding share of Class B
common stock owned on the record date.
 
-24-Table of Contents
Adoption of the Merger Proposal
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares
of Poshmark common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record date. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special
Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank,
broker or other nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Under the Merger Agreement, stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal is a condition to the consummation of the Merger.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Poshmark common stock
present, in person or represented by proxy. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure
to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) and broker non-votes will
have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Company does not intend
to call a vote on this proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.

The Company will retain an independent party to receive and tabulate the proxies and ballots, and to serve as the inspector of election to certify the
results of the Special Meeting.

As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, at the Special Meeting holders of Poshmark common stock will consider and vote on a proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement (referred to as the “Merger Proposal”). The Merger cannot be completed without the adoption of the Merger Agreement by
the requisite vote of Poshmark stockholders. You are urged to carefully read this proxy statement in its entirety for more detailed information concerning
the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including the information set forth under the sections of this proxy statement titled “The Merger” and “The
Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement
carefully and in its entirety.
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of
Poshmark common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record date. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special
Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank,
broker or other nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
The Poshmark Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the Merger Proposal.

We are asking that you approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (referred to as the “Adjournment Proposal”).
Poshmark is asking stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Poshmark Board to vote in favor of any adjournment of the
Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, as determined by the Company, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the
Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting.
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Poshmark common stock
present, in person or represented by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes (if any) will not count as votes cast on the Adjournment Proposal.
Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure
to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the
Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Poshmark does not intend to
call a vote on this proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.
The Poshmark Board recommends a vote “FOR” approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

As part of Poshmark’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board and management of Poshmark
(“Poshmark management” or “Company management”) periodically review, consider and assess Poshmark’s operations and financial performance and
overall industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans, with the goal of enhancing stockholder
value. This review at times includes, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other
financial and strategic alternatives.
On January 4, 2022, a member of the Board introduced Manish Chandra, Poshmark’s co-founder and CEO, to representatives of NAVER to explore a
potential commercial partnership between the companies involving (i) the expansion of Poshmark’s business into South Korea and potentially Japan and
NAVER’s entry into U.S. markets and (ii) a potential private investment in Poshmark’s public equity by NAVER (such partnership and investment referred
to together as the “potential commercial partnership and investment”).
On January 12, 2022, the Company and NAVER entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement to further explore the potential commercial
partnership and investment. Such non-disclosure agreement did not contain any standstill or employee non-solicitation provisions. Following the
execution of the non-disclosure agreement, Poshmark management proceeded to conduct multiple due diligence sessions with representatives of NAVER.
On January 27, 2022, certain members of the Board met with representatives from Goldman Sachs and representatives of Financial Advisor A and
Financial Advisor B in connection with the Company’s ongoing review of potential strategic alternatives.
On February 2, 2022 and February 10, 2022, representatives of NAVER and Poshmark management initiated discussions around the framework for
the potential commercial partnership and investment.
On February 16, 2022, NAVER submitted an initial proposal for the potential commercial partnership and investment, which proposal included a
preliminary $125 million investment structured as a convertible preferred security. From February 16, 2022 until August 5, 2022, when, as described below,
NAVER first submitted an initial non-binding proposal to acquire all outstanding Company common stock, the parties continued to negotiate the key
terms of a potential commercial partnership and investment.
 
-32-Table of Contents
On March 4, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs,
Financial Advisor A and Goodwin Procter LLP, Poshmark’s outside counsel (“Goodwin”), in attendance for portions of the meeting. The Board discussed
the potential commercial partnership and investment with NAVER, and determined that it would be advisable to engage a financial advisor in order to
assist in the evaluation of the potential commercial partnership and investment and other potential strategic alternatives. The Board met with
representatives from Goldman Sachs and Financial Advisor A to assess each firm as a potential advisor to the Company in connection with such
evaluation. Following discussion, the Board determined to proceed with the formal engagement of Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor, noting
Goldman Sachs’ extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which Poshmark operates and experience advising technology companies in
connection with potential strategic transactions. On the basis of these considerations, and subject in all respects to the Board’s review of a customary
relationships disclosure to be produced by Goldman Sachs, the Board authorized Poshmark management and Goodwin to negotiate the terms of an
engagement letter for the purpose of engaging Goldman Sachs.
On March 27, 2022, representatives of NAVER had a follow-up call with Poshmark management regarding Poshmark’s Q4 2021 earnings.
On March 28, 2022, at the request of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided customary relationship disclosures to Poshmark, and
such disclosure was promptly shared with the Board and included disclosure of certain relationships between Goldman Sachs and representatives thereof
on the one hand and NAVER, Mayfield Fund, L.L.C., and certain other parties and their respective affiliates, on the other hand. A summary of such
relationships is set forth in the section titled “Opinion of Goldman Sachs.”
On April 1, 2022, after review and consultation with the Board and with the Board’s unanimous approval, the Company signed a formal engagement
letter with Goldman Sachs in connection with the Company’s evaluation of a potential strategic transaction, including the potential commercial
partnership and investment with NAVER.
On April 13, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, at the Board’s direction, and representatives of NAVER’s financial advisor, LionTree LLC
(“LionTree”), initiated discussions on the topic of a minority equity investment.
On May 2, 2022, NAVER management met with members of Poshmark management at Poshmark’s headquarters to present an overview of NAVER’s
business. Following the meeting, a representative of NAVER indicated to Mr. Chandra that NAVER was interested in potentially engaging in a broader
strategic transaction with Poshmark in the form of an acquisition of all outstanding Company common stock (such potential strategic transaction
involving Poshmark and NAVER, the “proposed transaction”). Mr. Chandra stated he was not in a position to respond to such interest at such time, given
the Board had only previously discussed a potential commercial partnership and investment with NAVER. Following the discussion, Mr. Chandra gave an
update regarding such expression of interest to certain members of the Board.
On May 6, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Goodwin in attendance. Mr. Chandra provided the Board a status update on discussions with NAVER regarding the potential commercial partnership and
investment and informed the Board of NAVER’s interest in potentially engaging in a broader strategic transaction with Poshmark in the form of an
acquisition of all outstanding Company common stock. The Board also discussed that it would need to evaluate Poshmark’s long-range plan, the current
value of Poshmark and available strategic opportunities before agreeing to a potential commercial partnership and investment with NAVER or pursuing
other strategic alternatives. Accordingly, in order to be able to fully assess Poshmark’s standalone prospects and potential, and to be able to better
evaluate such prospects and potential relative to the potential commercial partnership and investment and/or other potential strategic alternatives, the
Board authorized Poshmark management to develop a standalone long-range plan using the best up-to-date information then available.
 
-33-
Table of Contents
On May 10, during a call between representatives NAVER and Mr. Chandra to discuss the investment process, representatives of NAVER again
raised the idea of a full acquisition. Mr. Chandra requested that NAVER continue to focus on the potential commercial partnership and investment.
From May 25, 2022 through June 23, 2022, members of Poshmark management and NAVER management held multiple meetings during which the
teams presented overviews of their respective businesses and focused on exploring a potential commercial partnership and investment, especially on
joint market opportunity in Korea, the live shopping business and the Japan market.
On June 14, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Poshmark management in attendance. Mr. Chandra provided an
update on Poshmark’s long-range plan and led a discussion on key assumptions made in preparing the long-range plan. The Board also discussed the
methodology and investment assumptions and provided feedback on the long-range plan.
On July 5, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goodwin also in attendance. Mr. Chandra
provided a status update regarding the potential commercial partnership and investment and recent interactions with NAVER, including NAVER’s
continued interest in a potential acquisition of Poshmark. Representatives of Goodwin presented an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties under
Delaware law and discussed certain considerations for the Board when undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of
the Company. The members of Poshmark management also presented certain unaudited financial forecasts for Poshmark for fiscal years 2022 through
2025 (the “Company LRP”), which Poshmark management extrapolated through fiscal year 2032, and certain forecasts related to the expected utilization
by the Company of certain net operating loss carryforwards (the “Tax Attributes Forecasts” and together with the Company LRP and extrapolations, the
“Management Projections”), which had been prepared at the request of the Board in connection with the Board’s review of strategic alternatives.
Poshmark management noted that the Company LRP assumes certain keys to growth and continuous improvement in buyer conversion and spend,
growing AUs, seller conversion and monetization, and does not reflect the impact of a potential partnership with NAVER given the early stage of the
parties’ discussion around the framework for and key terms of the potential commercial partnership and investment and lack of agreement on any material
terms. Poshmark management also discussed the market environment and underscored in their presentation the challenges facing the Company noting
certain key execution risks of the standalone plan, including the growth of active user retention or active buyer conversion in part driven by the
introduction of new rules or technology disruptions, major changes in the competitive or regulatory landscape and the challenges of gaining a foothold
in another country. Poshmark management also discussed Poshmark’s livestreaming and live auctions initiative, which Poshmark described as an
opportunity to reinvent selling by making live selling available to everyone and to integrate live selling into Poshmark’s other initiatives such as
Poshmark parties. Poshmark management noted that this initiative could potentially be a significant revenue generator and growth opportunity for
Poshmark. Poshmark management also noted, however, that while Poshmark was aiming to begin the new initiative in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022,
the initiative was still being conceptualized, and therefore it was untested and too speculative at that point to reasonably reflect any potential revenue,
costs and other financial metrics associated with such initiative in the projections being reviewed and approved by the Board. Poshmark management and
the Board discussed the initiative and the potential opportunity associated therewith, and the Board concurred with Poshmark management’s view to not
include such initiative in the projections given the speculative nature of any potential revenue, costs, and other financial metrics associated with the
initiative. The Board directed Poshmark management to present information on such initiative to NAVER as part of NAVER’s due diligence and
assessment of potential growth drivers such information was subsequently provided to NAVER during the due diligence meetings described below.
Following discussion, the Board approved the Company LRP and directed Poshmark management to share the Management Projections with Goldman
Sachs for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses in connection with the Board’s evaluation of any potential strategic transaction, including both
the potential commercial partnership and investment and potential acquisition of Poshmark by NAVER, and if requested, with NAVER for purposes of
NAVER’s evaluation of a potential acquisition of Poshmark. The Management Projections are more fully described in the section titled
 
-34-
Table of Contents
“Certain Financial Projections.” The directors were then invited to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest they may have in relation to
NAVER and its affiliates and each of the directors confirmed that such director is independent from and does not have a relationship with NAVER or its
affiliates. The Board also authorized Poshmark management, certain members of the Board and representatives of Goldman Sachs to continue to engage
in discussions with NAVER and its advisors regarding the potential commercial partnership and investment, noting that consistent with the Board’s
consideration of various strategic and other opportunities available to Poshmark and its fiduciary duties, the Board would be willing to review a proposal
submitted by NAVER if NAVER remained interested in a potential acquisition of Poshmark.
On July 19, 2022 and July 20, 2022, Poshmark held in-person diligence sessions with NAVER management (with representatives of LionTree in
attendance), at Poshmark’s headquarters with respect to the potential commercial partnership and investment. From July 21, 2022 to August 2, 2022,
members of Poshmark management and NAVER management held multiple follow-up due diligence meetings.
On August 2, 2022, Mr. Chandra and a NAVER representative spoke by phone, during which NAVER reaffirmed its interest in an acquisition of all
outstanding Company common stock. Mr. Chandra indicated the Board’s willingness to review a proposal for the proposed transaction and requested
that NAVER submit a formal proposal if it remained interested in an acquisition. Both parties also agreed at that point that the potential commercial
partnership and investment did not meet either party’s objectives at that point and discussions with respect to potential commercial partnership and
investment were subsequently terminated.
On August 3, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goodwin also in
attendance. Among other things, the Board discussed adopting resolutions forming a transaction committee of the Board (the “Transaction Committee”)
to consider, review and evaluate any proposals made with respect to the potential commercial partnership and investment as well as any other potential
strategic alternative or alternatives thereto, including, without limitation, Poshmark continuing to operate as an independent, publicly traded company.
The Board discussed that the Transaction Committee was being formed for expediency of process, and not in response to any conflict of interest in
relation to NAVER and its affiliates. The Board then adopted resolutions forming the Transaction Committee and appointed Mr. Navin Chaddha, Mr. Hans
Tung, and Mr. Jeff Epstein, each an independent director, to the Transaction Committee and approved the reimbursement of all reasonable expenses
incurred by such directors in connection with their service on the Transaction Committee.
On August 5, 2022, NAVER submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire Poshmark for $16.50 per share in cash (the “August 5 proposal”).
The $16.50 per share offer price implied a premium to Poshmark’s closing price on August 4, 2022 of approximately 38.7%. The August 5 proposal noted
that it was not subject to any financing condition and that at the appropriate time and with the approval of the Board, NAVER would like to discuss the
possibility of a rollover investment by a limited group of stockholders. NAVER also expressed the view that the retention of Poshmark’s current
management and employees is critical to the future success of the business and they are important stakeholders in the potential transaction, and
therefore at the appropriate time and with the approval of the Board, NAVER would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential go-forward incentive
and alignment arrangements with Poshmark management. Poshmark’s management, including Mr. Chandra, was directed by the Board not to, and they did
not, discuss any post-transaction employment or compensation terms for Poshmark management with any potential acquirers, with the sole exception
that Mr. Chandra began such discussions with representatives of NAVER with the Board’s approval on September 22, 2022, as discussed below. In
addition, Poshmark’s management team, including Mr. Chandra, was directed by the Board not to, and they did not, discuss any potential rollover
investment in any potential acquirers. The August 5 proposal also included a request that Mr. Chandra, certain entities affiliated with Menlo Ventures,
Mayfield XIII, Mayfield Select, GGV Capital V L.P. and GGV Capital V Entrepreneurs Fund L.P. would be required to sign voting agreements and a request
for a 30-day exclusivity period.

On August 6, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Goodwin also in attendance. Mr. Chandra provided the Transaction Committee with a status update regarding the potential transaction with NAVER and
recent interactions with NAVER, noting that NAVER had submitted a non-binding proposal on August 5 to acquire Poshmark for $16.50 per share, and
representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed a summary of the material financial and economic aspects of NAVER’s proposal. The August 5 proposal was
provided to the Transaction Committee prior to the meeting. Representatives of Goodwin discussed certain key terms that would be applicable to a
potential transaction with NAVER. The Transaction Committee and its advisors discussed potential responses to NAVER’s August 5 proposal, and
representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed a list of strategic and financial sponsor counterparties to be considered by the Transaction Committee for
inclusion in a potential market check, if the Board decided to conduct a market check. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee authorized Mr.
Chandra to revert to NAVER to confirm receipt of the August 5 proposal and note that the Board would need to discuss and evaluate the proposal.
Later on August 6, 2022, as authorized by the Transaction Committee, Mr. Chandra called a representative of NAVER and conveyed that the Board
would meet to discuss and evaluate the August 5 proposal.
On August 7, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin in
attendance for a portion of the meeting. Mr. Chandra provided the Board with a status update regarding the potential transaction with NAVER, including
a discussion of recent interactions with NAVER and the August 5 proposal. Representatives of Goodwin again presented an overview of the directors’
fiduciary duties under Delaware law and discussed certain considerations for the Board when undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives,
including a potential sale of the Company. The Board and its advisors then discussed the importance of understanding the Company LRP and the role
that the Company LRP would play in the preliminary financial analyses to be performed by Goldman Sachs, at the Board’s direction. The Board and its
advisors also discussed a potential pre-signing market check and the implications of entering into exclusivity with NAVER at this time. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs reviewed a summary of key financial and economic terms of the August 5 proposal and the Board and its advisors discussed potential
responses to NAVER, as well as considerations related to the timing and scope for a potential pre-signing market check. Representatives of Goldman
Sachs reviewed a potential list of strategic and financial sponsor parties for the Board’s consideration and the Board and its advisors discussed the risks
of leaks and management distraction based on the scope of the market check. Following discussion, the Board (i) directed Mr. Chandra, to revert to and
encourage NAVER to submit an improved offer to improve NAVER’s chances of receiving a positive reaction from the Board to their proposal, and to
indicate that the revised proposal would have to be “in the $20s” for the Board’s consideration as an effort to obtain a higher offer from NAVER, (ii)
approved and reaffirmed the Company LRP, which was initially approved by the Board on July 5, 2022, and directed Goldman Sachs to use the
Management Projections for the preparation of its preliminary financial analyses and (iii) authorized a pre-signing market check consistent with the
Management Projections for the preparation of its preliminary financial analyses and (iii) authorized a pre-signing market check consistent with the
discussion between the Board and representatives of Goldman Sachs, with the Transaction Committee determining the specific timing and scope of a pre-
signing market check, and authorized representatives of Goldman Sachs to conduct such market check under the guidance of the Transaction Committee.
Immediately following the meeting, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of
Goodwin also in attendance. The Transaction Committee and its advisors discussed the counterparties to be contacted in the pre-signing market check,
and subsequent to the meeting, the Transaction Committee directed representatives of Goldman Sachs to contact four strategic counterparties (referred to
herein as “Strategic Party A”, “Strategic Party B”, “Strategic Party C” and “Strategic Party D”) and a financial sponsor counterparty (referred to
herein as “Financial Sponsor A”), who the Transaction Committee determined, after its discussions with representatives of Goldman Sachs, were the
most likely potential parties to be interested in a transaction with Poshmark. The Transaction Committee and representatives of Goodwin then discussed
NAVER’s desire to discuss the possibility of a rollover investment by a limited group of stockholders at the appropriate time and with the approval of the
Board as indicated in their August 5 proposal, with representatives
 
-36-
Table of Contents
of Goodwin explaining the directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law and other considerations with respect to any request by NAVER that the
directors or their affiliates participate in a rollover investment. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee directed representatives of Goodwin to
continue to monitor any subsequent proposals by NAVER regarding any rollover investment.
Later on August 7, 2022, as authorized by the Board, Mr. Chandra called a representative of NAVER and conveyed the message of the Board that (i)
the $16.50 per share offer price remained inadequate and (ii) the Board encouraged NAVER to submit an improved offer to improve NAVER’s chances of
receiving a positive reaction from the Board to their proposal and the revised proposal would have to be “in the $20s” for the Board’s consideration.
On August 8, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs commenced the Company’s pre-signing market check with respect to Financial Sponsor A,
Strategic Party A, Strategic Party B, Strategic Party C, and Strategic Party D in accordance with the directions of the Board and the Transaction
Committee, in each case with the message that the Company was prepared to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the counterparty to enable the
counterparty to expeditiously receive access to value-determining due diligence and potentially submit a proposal for a potential transaction.
On August 15, 2022, the Company and Financial Sponsor A entered into a non-disclosure agreement that included a standstill provision that
prohibited Financial Sponsor A, for an agreed-upon period from the date of the agreement, from offering to acquire or acquiring Poshmark, and from
taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of Poshmark (but did not include a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive”
provision), subject to the ability of Financial Sponsor A to make certain confidential proposals to the Company and to certain customary fall-away
provisions to the standstill in the event of the entry into, commencement or public announcement of certain change of control transactions involving the
Company and any third party.
Later that day, the Board held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also in
attendance. Prior to the meeting, Poshmark had shared with members of Poshmark management certain management guidelines which, among other
things, directed Poshmark management not to have any discussions regarding post-closing employment with NAVER until and unless approved and
authorized by the Board or a committee thereof. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed its preliminary financial analysis of the Company and the
proposed $16.50 per share offer price from NAVER, which represented a 40% premium to Poshmark’s closing price on August 12, 2022 (the last full trading
day prior to the Board meeting), and the Board discussed such analysis. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an update on the pre-signing
market check, noting that a total of five potential counterparties had been contacted, with Financial Sponsor A entering into a non-disclosure agreement
earlier that day. The Board then discussed the scope of the market check and concurred with the conclusions of the Transaction Committee, with the
exception that one additional strategic party, Strategic Party E, should be considered for inclusion in the pre-signing market check. The Board directed
representatives of Goldman Sachs to include Strategic Party E in the pre-signing market check. The Board and its advisors then discussed potential
responses to NAVER and various tactical considerations with respect to such responses, and the Board unanimously authorized Mr. Chandra, to revert to
NAVER with the message that its revised proposal would have to be “solidly in the $20s” for the Board’s consideration and Mr. Chandra conveyed such
message to representatives of NAVER the following day.
From August 15, 2022 to August 16, 2022, representatives of NAVER traveled to Poshmark’s headquarters in San Francisco to attend in-person
sessions to discuss growth strategy with Poshmark management. Such representatives of NAVER also met with the lead independent director of the
Board to further discuss the potential transaction.
Also on August 15, 2022, the Company and Strategic Party D entered into a non-disclosure agreement that included a standstill provision that
prohibited Strategic Party D, for an agreed-upon period from the date of the
 
-37-
Table of Contents
agreement, from offering to acquire or acquiring Poshmark, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of
Poshmark. Such non-disclosure agreement contained a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision but permitted Strategic Party D to make certain
confidential proposals to the Company and was subject to certain customary fall-away provisions to the standstill in the event of the entry into,
commencement or public announcement of certain change of control transactions involving the Company and any third party.
On August 16, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs reached out to representatives of Strategic Party E as part of the Company’s pre-signing
market check in accordance with the directions of the Board. Also on August 16, 2022, representatives of Strategic Party A and Strategic Party C each
indicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that such party would not further evaluate a potential transaction with Poshmark at this time.
From August 18, 2022 to August 23, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A, Strategic Party B, Strategic Party D and Strategic Party E
attended management presentations with Poshmark management, except that representatives of Strategic Party B did not receive any non-public
confidential information regarding Poshmark given representatives of Strategic Party B, at Strategic Party B’s request, had not executed a confidentiality
agreement prior to such presentation. Strategic Party B understood that if it chose to move forward subsequent to such initial meeting, Poshmark would
require a customary confidentiality agreement between the parties.
On August 23, 2022, the Company and Strategic Party E entered into a non-disclosure agreement. Such non-disclosure agreement did not contain a
standstill provision, but Strategic Party E understood a customary standstill provision would be required if Strategic Party E decided to move forward
after the management presentation.
On August 24, 2022, representatives of Strategic Party B indicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that such party would not further evaluate
a potential transaction with Poshmark at this time.
On August 25, 2022, NAVER submitted a revised non-binding proposal to acquire Poshmark for $17.50 per share in cash (the “August 25
proposal”). The $17.50 per share offer price implied a premium to Poshmark’s closing price on August 24, 2022 of approximately 59.1% and represented a
6.1% increase on NAVER’s original offer price per share submitted on August 5, 2022. The August 25 proposal again noted that at the appropriate time
and with the approval of the Board, NAVER would like to discuss the possibility of a rollover investment by a limited group of stockholders and potential
go-forward arrangements with Poshmark management, and included a request for a 30-day exclusivity period. Poshmark’s management team, including
Mr. Chandra, was again directed by the Board not to, and they did not, discuss any post-transaction employment or compensation terms for Poshmark
management with representatives of NAVER, with the sole exception that Mr. Chandra began such discussions with the Board’s approval on September
22, 2022, as discussed below. In addition, Poshmark’s management team, including Mr. Chandra, was again directed by the Board not to, and they did not,
discuss any potential rollover investment with representatives of NAVER.
On August 26, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Goodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a status update regarding the Company’s pre-signing market check, noting that
all of the counterparties included in the market check, other than Financial Sponsor A, had declined to further evaluate a potential transaction with
Poshmark at this time. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided a status update regarding a potential transaction with NAVER and recent
interactions with NAVER, noting that NAVER had submitted the August 25 proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs summarized the material financial
and economic aspects of NAVER’s revised proposal. The Transaction Committee then discussed tactical considerations relating to the Company’s
potential responses to NAVER’s revised proposal, including that Poshmark would not entertain exclusivity until the parties were agreed on price, and the
potential timeline to signing, and following discussion, instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss next steps with representatives of
LionTree, including with respect to due diligence, and instructed representatives of Goodwin to prepare an initial draft of the merger agreement.

Also on August 26, 2022, at Financial Sponsor A’s request, Poshmark management attended a follow-up diligence session with representatives of
Financial Sponsor A.
On August 27, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also in
attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a status update regarding the Company’s pre-signing market check, noting that all of the
counterparties included in the market check, other than Financial Sponsor A, had declined to further evaluate a potential transaction with Poshmark at
this time, explaining that (i) Strategic Party A found the present timing of a potential transaction with Poshmark challenging given internal developments,
(ii) Strategic Party C, Strategic Party D and Strategic Party E all expressed respect for the platform, but said it was not high enough on their list of M&A
priorities at that time and (iii) Strategic Party B questioned the strategic fit within its existing portfolio. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided a
status update regarding a potential transaction with NAVER, noting that NAVER had submitted the August 25 proposal. Representatives of Goldman
Sachs reviewed a summary of the material financial and economic aspects of NAVER’s revised proposal. The Board then discussed at length the potential
timeline to entering into a definitive agreement with NAVER and next steps in the process, and representatives of Goodwin again provided the Board with
an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties in their evaluation of a proposed transaction. Representatives of Goodwin also presented a proposed set of
certain non-price terms to be reflected in the initial draft of the proposed merger agreement that representatives of Goodwin would send to
representatives of NAVER’s legal counsel, Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”). Following discussion, the Board unanimously (i) approved moving forward
with a potential transaction with NAVER at a price per share at or above $17.50 so long as NAVER completes business diligence in an expedited manner
and agrees to work towards signing prior to September 21, (ii) authorized Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs to continue to
negotiate with NAVER to get the best price available and (iii) authorized representatives of Goodwin to send an initial draft of the merger agreement
reflecting the non-price terms discussed with the Board. The Board also approved granting NAVER exclusivity for a limited period of time but only after
NAVER confirms completion of its business diligence and provides a full markup of the merger agreement.
On August 27, 2022, Mr. Chandra sent an email to a representative of NAVER indicating that the Board was prepared to move forward with a
proposed transaction at a price of $18.50 per share.
On August 29, 2022, representatives of Goodwin sent to representatives of Kirkland Poshmark’s initial draft of a proposed merger agreement for the
proposed transaction. Representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland continued to negotiate and revise the merger agreement until the parties’ entry into the
merger agreement on October 3, 2022. Representatives of Goodwin also sent to representatives of Kirkland an amendment to the non-disclosure
agreement entered into by Poshmark and NAVER on January 11, 2022, which amendment included a standstill provision that prohibited NAVER, for an
agreed-upon period from the date of the amendment, from offering to acquire or acquiring Poshmark, and from taking certain other actions, including
soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of Poshmark (but did not include a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision), subject to the ability of
NAVER to make certain confidential proposals to the Company and to certain customary fall-away provisions to the standstill in the event of the entry
into or commencement or public announcement of certain change of control transactions involving the Company and any third party. Representatives of
Goodwin and Kirkland continued to negotiate and revise the amendment to the non-disclosure agreement until the parties’ entry into the amendment on
September 5, 2022.
On August 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, representatives of NAVER and LionTree attended in-person business due diligence sessions at
Poshmark’s headquarters.
Also on August 31, 2022, representatives of Goodwin sent to representatives of Kirkland Poshmark’s initial draft of a voting and support agreement
to be entered into by certain Poshmark stockholders, including Mr. Chandra, Mayfield XIII, Mayfield Select, GGV Capital V L.P. and GGV Capital V
Entrepreneurs Fund L.P. Representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland continued to negotiate and revise the voting agreement until execution of the voting
and support agreements concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement on October 3, 2022.

On September 2, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A indicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that such party would not further
evaluate a potential transaction with Poshmark at this time, noting that if such party were to submit a proposal following completion of diligence, it would
likely not be able to offer a meaningful premium. Also on September 2, 2022, representatives of Kirkland delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement
and other transaction documents to representatives of Goodwin.
On September 7, 2022, a representative of NAVER called Mr. Chandra to verbally convey a revised proposal to acquire Poshmark at $17.80 per share
(the “September 7 proposal”), noting that NAVER was still in the process of conducting due diligence, but was willing to improve its offer to $17.80 to
continue to move the proposed transaction forward and that NAVER did not see any incremental value above $17.80 per share.
On September 8, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs
and Goodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a status update regarding a potential transaction with NAVER and recent
interactions with NAVER, noting that earlier that day, a representative of NAVER had verbally conveyed the September 7 proposal. Representatives of
Goodwin also reviewed with the Transaction Committee key legal issues reflected in Kirkland’s mark-up of the initial draft merger agreement delivered to
representatives of Goodwin on September 2, 2022 including (i) an initial outside date of six months following signing, shortened from the initially
proposed nine months, (ii) a Company termination fee equal to 3.5% of equity value, increased from the initially proposed 2.75% of equity value and (iii)
the right of NAVER to terminate the merger agreement and collect the Company termination fee if the Company or the Board materially breaches the no-
shop provisions of the merger agreement. Representatives of Goodwin discussed such terms with the Transaction Committee. The Transaction Committee
then discussed potential responses to NAVER’s September 7 proposal, taking into consideration the $17.80 per share offer price implied a premium to
Poshmark’s closing price on September 8, 2022 of approximately 56.7%, the fact that the Board had authorized proceeding with a potential transaction
with NAVER at a price at or above $17.50 per share, the limited number of outstanding issues in the draft merger agreement, and NAVER’s proposed
timeline to entering into a definitive agreement by October 5, 2022. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee agreed it would be willing to move
forward with a potential transaction with NAVER at a price of $17.80 per share but authorized Mr. Chandra to revert to NAVER with a counterproposal of
$18.00 per share in order to obtain the best price possible and instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to reach out to representatives of LionTree to
convey the same message and also request a firm commitment on the timeline proposed by NAVER to enter into a definitive agreement by October 5,
2022.
Later that day, at the Transaction Committee’s direction, representatives of Goldman Sachs called representatives of LionTree to convey a
counterproposal at $18.00 per share, in accordance with the guidance of the Transaction Committee.
On September 9, 2022, a representative of NAVER called Mr. Chandra to propose a best and final offer of $17.90 per share (the “September 9
proposal”), subject to the parties entering into an exclusivity arrangement, which Mr. Chandra agreed to as authorized by the Board and the Transaction
Committee.
Later that evening, in accordance with the directions of the Board and the Transaction Committee, representatives of Goodwin sent to
representatives of Kirkland a markup of the exclusivity agreement. Representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland continued to exchange drafts of the
exclusivity agreement until the parties’ entry into the exclusivity agreement on September 11, 2022, which granted NAVER exclusivity until September 26,
2022, subject to an automatic extension of such exclusivity period to 9:30 a.m. (New York time) on October 6, 2022, upon NAVER’s written confirmation of
(i) the per share offer price pursuant to the September 9 proposal and (ii) an anticipated signing date of no later than October 6, 2022.
On September 11, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs
and Goodwin also in attendance. Mr. Chandra provided an update to the Transaction Committee on his call with a representative of NAVER on September
9, 2022, during

which the parties agreed to move forward with a potential transaction at $17.90 per share as described above. Representatives of Goodwin also provided
an update on the ongoing negotiations of (i) the merger agreement, noting that the parties were aligned on path forward with respect to a majority of the
material issues presented in the current markup of the merger agreement, subject to the Transaction Committee’s approval of such positions, and that the
parties were otherwise conceptually aligned on the remaining few issues and (ii) the exclusivity agreement, which representatives of Goodwin noted was
in substantially final form. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee authorized Poshmark management to enter into the exclusivity agreement and
instructed representatives of Goodwin to send back to representatives of Kirkland markups of the definitive agreements reflecting the positions
discussed and continue to negotiate such agreements. Over the course of the ensuing period of time until the parties entered into the merger agreement
on October 3, 2022, the parties finalized their negotiation of the terms of the merger agreement and related ancillary documents pertaining to the proposed
transaction, with the representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland continuing to exchange drafts of such documents.
Throughout this period of discussions and negotiations, NAVER continued a detailed due diligence review of Poshmark, including without
limitation through access to extensive business, financial, accounting, tax, intellectual property and legal related documentation made available in an
electronic data room. From September 11, 2022 to September 20, 2022, Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin
proceeded to conduct multiple additional due diligence management sessions with representatives of NAVER and its third party advisors. Poshmark
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also continued to respond to NAVER’s due diligence requests until the parties’ entry
into the merger agreement on October 3, 2022.
Subsequent to the parties agreeing on valuation and the material non-financial transaction terms as a basis for moving forward towards a potential
transaction, on September 17, 2022, representatives of Kirkland requested that NAVER be permitted to initiate discussions with Mr. Chandra regarding Mr.
Chandra’s potential post-closing employment with NAVER and the terms thereof. Representatives of Kirkland stated NAVER’s position that such
discussions and agreement with respect to post-closing employment terms for Mr. Chandra would be a condition to signing a definitive agreement with
respect to the proposed transaction.
On September 19, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management, at the request of the Board and
Transaction Committee, and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided a status
update regarding the potential transaction with NAVER and recent interactions with NAVER and LionTree. The Transaction Committee and its advisors
discussed recent trading patterns in Poshmark common stock, particularly relative to peers and the broader market since entering into exclusivity with
NAVER. Representatives of Goodwin then provided an update on the various transaction documents being negotiated with NAVER, noting that the
parties were in agreement on all material terms. Representatives of Goodwin also noted NAVER’s request to initiate discussions with Mr. Chandra
regarding Mr. Chandra’s potential post-closing employment with NAVER and the terms thereof. Following extensive discussion, and in light of the parties
having agreed on valuation and the material non-financial transaction terms as a basis for moving forward towards a potential transaction, the
Transaction Committee unanimously authorized Mr. Chandra to have such discussions with NAVER, subject to (i) Mr. Chandra providing timely updates
on any such discussions to representatives of Goodwin which representatives of Goodwin would communicate to the Transaction Committee and the
Board and (ii) Mr. Chandra retaining his own legal counsel. Mr. Chandra retained his own legal counsel on September 14, 2022, and between September
22, 2022, and October 3, 2022, Mr. Chandra negotiated his post-closing compensatory arrangements with NAVER and arrived at an agreement on such
terms (see the section titled “New Arrangements with Company Executive Officers”). Prior to these developments and negotiations commencing on
September 22, 2022, Mr. Chandra did not discuss the terms of his potential post-closing employment or compensation with any representatives of
NAVER.
On September 26, 2022, representatives of Kirkland delivered NAVER’s written confirmation of (i) the per share offer price pursuant to the
September 9 proposal and (ii) an anticipated signing date of no later than October 6, 2022, extending the exclusivity period to 9:30 a.m. (New York time) on
October 6, 2022.

On September 28, 2022, NAVER submitted a proposal for Mr. Chandra’s post-closing compensation arrangements. Over the course of the ensuing
period of time until the parties entered into the merger agreement on October 3, 2022, Mr. Chandra and NAVER finalized their negotiation of the terms of
the binding employee term sheet and holdback agreement, described in further detail in the section titled “New Arrangements with Company Executive
Officers.”
On October 2, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Goodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goodwin provided a general update on the status of the various transaction documents as well as the
ongoing discussions between Mr. Chandra and NAVER regarding his post-closing employment and compensation arrangement. The Transaction
Committee and its advisors then discussed the recent trading performance of Poshmark common stock, particularly relative to peers and the broader
market since entering into exclusivity with NAVER and representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed its preliminary financial analysis of the Company
and NAVER’s proposed $17.90 per share offer price. Representatives of Goodwin also provided an update on Mr. Chandra’s discussions with NAVER
regarding his post-closing employment and compensation arrangement and noted that representatives of Goodwin have been kept apprised of and
included in many of those discussions. The Transaction Committee then held an executive session during which members asked questions regarding the
key terms of Mr. Chandra’s post-closing employment and compensation arrangement and timing of negotiations.
On October 3, 2022, the Board met to review the final terms of the proposed definitive agreement between Poshmark and NAVER and related
ancillary documents, copies of which were provided to the Board in advance of the meeting, and to vote on whether to approve entry into the proposed
definitive agreement with NAVER. Members of Poshmark management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin also attended the meeting.
Representatives of Goodwin reviewed the final terms of the proposed definitive agreement between Poshmark and NAVER. Representatives of Goodwin
also reminded the Board of the employment and compensation discussions between Mr. Chandra and NAVER, noting that, as previously authorized by
the Board, Mr. Chandra had engaged in discussions with NAVER, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Goodwin participating in certain
discussions at the request of the Board and Transaction Committee, and summarized the key terms of Mr. Chandra’s post-closing employment with
NAVER and related compensation arrangement. Such arrangements are described in further detail in the section titled “New Arrangements with Company
Executive Officers.” Members of the Transaction Committee then presented the formal recommendation of the Transaction Committee with respect to the
proposed transaction, including that it was the Transaction Committee’s determination to favorably recommend that the Board approve the proposed
transaction. At the request of the Board and Transaction Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board its financial analysis of
the Company and the proposed Merger Consideration of $17.90 per share of Company common stock in cash and delivered to the Board an oral opinion,
which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated October 3, 2022, to the effect that, as of October 3, 2022 and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $17.90 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than
NAVER and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point
of view to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Goldman Sachs’ opinion, please see the section titled “Opinion of Goldman Sachs.” After
discussions of the proposed transaction with NAVER and the matters summarized for the Board at the meeting, the Board then unanimously (i)
determined that it was in the best interests of Poshmark and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement with NAVER
and consummate the merger, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement with NAVER, (iii) recommended that Poshmark
stockholders adopt the merger agreement with NAVER and (iv) directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of Poshmark stockholders at a
special meeting of Poshmark stockholders.
After the Board meeting on October 3, 2022, Poshmark and NAVER executed and delivered the merger agreement, and Mr. Chandra, Mayfield XIII,
Mayfield Select, GGV Capital V L.P. and GGV Capital V Entrepreneurs Fund L.P executed and delivered voting and support agreements. Subsequent to the
execution of the merger agreement and the voting and support agreements, Poshmark and NAVER issued a press release publicly announcing the
transaction.

The Board carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with Poshmark’s senior management and legal and financial
advisors and, upon the unanimous recommendation of the Transaction Committee, the Board unanimously: (1) determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger; (2) approved the
execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger; (3) resolved to recommend that the Company’s
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; and (4) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for
consideration by the Company’s stockholders at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, the Board recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” adoption of the
Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. 
In reaching their decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and to recommend that Poshmark stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the
Board and the Transaction Committee considered the following positive reasons to support the Merger Agreement:
 
•
the fact that the price of $17.90 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate and attractive value and liquidity to
Poshmark stockholders;
 
•
the financial strength of NAVER and its ability to fund the Merger Consideration with cash on hand;
 
•
the absence of any financing condition in the Merger Agreement;
 
•
the current and historical market prices of Poshmark common stock, including the market performance of Poshmark Class A common stock in
light of current industry, market and macroeconomic conditions, and the fact that the $17.90 per share to be received by Poshmark
stockholders in the Merger represents a substantial premium of approximately 15% of Poshmark’s Class A common stock closing price as of
October 3, 2022, a 34% premium to the 30-day VWAP and a 48% to the 90-day VWAP of Poshmark Class A common stock;
 
•
the belief that the $17.90 per share in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to Poshmark stockholders on a risk-adjusted, time-
adjusted basis than the other alternatives reasonably available to Poshmark, including;
 
•
the continued operation of Poshmark on a standalone basis and the pursuit of other potential actionable strategic or
financial transactions, including an investment by and commercial partnership with Parent as discussed between the parties
prior to exploring a potential sale transaction with Parent;
 
•
the Board’s assessment of Poshmark’s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and historical and projected
financial performance, which assessment included consideration of the following factors among others: (i) Poshmark’s
growth rate and concerns about macroeconomic conditions; (ii) nature of Poshmark’s industry, including competition from a
range of competitors, including both online and offline retailers; (iii) the need to continually innovate, improve and enhance
Poshmark’s platform in response to Poshmark users’ evolving needs; (iv) challenges Poshmark has faced in its standalone
efforts to expand internationally; (v) incremental regulatory requirements; and (vi) the investments that would be required in
connection with Poshmark’s long-term plan;
 
•
possible strategic transactions with third parties other than Parent, taking into account the financial capacity, risk of leaks,
regulatory considerations and other execution risks associated with potential alternative bidders; and
 
•
the fact that a pre-signing market check, which included outreach to five strategic counterparties and one financial sponsor
counterparty, did not result in likely actionable interest within the foreseeable near term (as described in more detail under
the section titled “The Merger - Background of the Merger”).
 
-43-Table of Contents
•
the belief that, after negotiations with Parent and its representatives (as described in more detail under the section titled “The Merger -
Background of the Merger”), $17.90 per share was the highest price that Parent was willing to pay as of the date of execution of the Merger
Agreement and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to Poshmark, in the aggregate, to which Parent
would be willing to agree;
 
•
the Board’s assessment of the terms of the Merger Agreement relating to Poshmark’s ability to respond to unsolicited acquisition
proposals, including:
 
•
Poshmark’s right to provide non-public information in response to, and to discuss and negotiate, certain unsolicited
acquisition proposals made before Company shareholder approval of the Merger is obtained; and
 
•
Poshmark’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement prior to obtaining Company shareholder approval of the Merger, in
specified circumstances relating to a superior proposal, subject to payment of a termination fee of $52,913,000, which the
Board believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and not an impediment to a competing transaction;
 
•
the Board’s assessment that the likelihood of completion of the Merger and the relatively low risk of regulatory challenges to the
transaction are significant factors in support of the transaction, in light of, among other things:
 
•
the lack of competitive overlaps between the businesses of Poshmark and Parent;
 
•
the obligations of Parent and Poshmark under the Merger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts to take all action
reasonably necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act
applicable to the Merger, including Parent’s obligation to refrain from certain acquisition activity that would reasonably be
expected to exacerbate such challenges;
 
•
the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement and the fact that Parent has a substantial amount of cash on
its balance sheet; and
 
•
the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which the Board believes are reasonable and customary, and
which, in the case of the conditions related to the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties, are generally
subject to a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement - Representations and Warranties”);
 
•
the Board’s consideration of the financial analyses presented by representatives of Goldman Sachs at the Board’s meeting on October 3,
2022, as well as the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated October 3,
2022, to the effect that, as of October 3, 2022, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $17.90 in
cash per share of Poshmark common stock to be paid to the holders (other than NAVER and its affiliates) of shares of Poshmark common
stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully
described under the section of this proxy statement titled “Opinion of Goldman Sachs”, which full text of the written opinion of Goldman
Sachs is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety;
 
•
the fact that Poshmark has sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary course prior to the consummation of the
Merger;
 
•
the fact that the definition of “Company Material Adverse Effect” has a number of customary exceptions and is generally a high standard
applied by courts;
 
•
the end date of April 3, 2023 (subject to extension under certain circumstances), which is expected to allow for sufficient time to complete
the Merger;

Table of Contents
•
the availability of statutory appraisal rights to Poshmark stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and otherwise comply with all required procedures under the DGCL;
 
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement was approved by the Board, which is comprised of a majority of independent directors who are not
employees of Poshmark or any of its subsidiaries, and which received advice from the Company’s outside financial and legal advisors in
evaluating, negotiating and recommending the terms of the Merger Agreement;
 
•
the fact that the consideration and negotiation of the Merger Agreement was conducted through extensive arm’s-length negotiations;

Poshmark’s rights to specific performance under the terms of the Merger Agreement; and
 
•
the fact that stockholders representing greater than a majority of the outstanding voting power of Poshmark’s common stock entered into
Voting Agreements concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board and the Transaction Committee also considered, among other things, the following negative
factors:
 
•
the fact that Poshmark stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in Poshmark following the Merger (other than as described in
the section titled “New Arrangements with Company Executive Officers”) and therefore will cease to participate in the future earnings of
growth that Poshmark may achieve;
 
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement does not provide Poshmark with an opportunity to actively solicit alternative bids after entry into the
Merger Agreement;
 
•
the possibility that the Merger is not completed as a result of failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or the institution of regulatory
injunctions in the United States, or the failure of other closing conditions;
 
•
the risk and costs of stockholder or third-party litigation relating to the Merger;
 
•
the risks and costs to Poshmark if the Merger is not completed;
 
•
the potential uncertainty about the likelihood, timing or effects of completion of the Merger, including on Poshmark’s stockholders,
employees, potential and existing customers, sellers, users and other parties, and the risk that such uncertainty may impair Poshmark’s
ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and could cause third parties to seek to change or not enter into business relationships
with Poshmark;
 
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Poshmark’s business before completion of the Merger, generally requiring Poshmark to use reasonable
best efforts to conduct its business in the ordinary course and prohibiting Poshmark from taking certain specified actions, subject to
specific limitations, which may delay or prevent Poshmark from undertaking business opportunities, anticipated or not, that may arise;
 
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger (many of which are
payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time and effort of Poshmark management required to complete the
Merger, which may distract management, disrupt its business operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;
 
•
the possibility that Poshmark may be required to pay a termination fee equal to $52,913,000 under certain circumstances;
 
•
the other transaction costs to be incurred in connection with the Merger;

Poshmark stockholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy statement titled “Interests of Poshmark’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger.”
The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board and the Transaction Committee is not, and is not
intended to be, exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with their evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these
matters, the Board and the Transaction Committee did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to rank or assign relative
weights to the various factors considered in reaching their respective determinations. In considering the factors described above and any other factors,
individual members of the Board and the Transaction Committee may have viewed factors differently or given different weight, merit or consideration to
different factors. In addition, the Board and the Transaction Committee did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular
factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board or the Transaction Committee, but
rather the Board and the Transaction Committee conducted an overall review of the factors described above, including discussions with Poshmark’s
senior management and legal and financial advisors.
The foregoing discussion of the reasoning of the Board and the Transaction Committee and certain information presented in this section is
forward-looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section of this proxy statement titled
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

At a meeting of the Poshmark Board held on October 3, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Poshmark Board that, as of
October 3, 2022, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $17.90 in cash per share of Poshmark common stock to
be paid to the holders (other than NAVER and its affiliates) of shares of Poshmark common stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated October 3, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory
services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Poshmark Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman
Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Poshmark common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any other
matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among
other things:

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Poshmark regarding their assessment of the past and
current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Poshmark; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of
Class A common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for Poshmark with similar information for certain other companies the
securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the technology industry; and performed
such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Poshmark Board, relied upon and assumed the accuracy
and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without
assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Poshmark Board that
the Management Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of
Poshmark. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other
off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Poshmark or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman
Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained
without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the
Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of
which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Poshmark to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of
the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Poshmark; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting
matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than NAVER and its affiliates) of shares
of Poshmark common stock as of the date of the opinion, of the $17.90 in cash per share of Poshmark common stock to be paid to such holders, taken in
the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or
aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
entered into or amended in connection with the Merger, including any allocation of the aggregate consideration payable to the holders of shares of
Poshmark common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including among the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common
stock, the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or
other constituencies of Poshmark; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers,
directors or employees of Poshmark, or class of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $17.90 in cash per share of Poshmark
common stock to be paid to the holders (other than NAVER and its affiliates) of shares of Poshmark common stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to
the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming
its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition,

Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which the Poshmark common stock will trade at any time or as to the potential effects of
volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Poshmark, NAVER or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of
Poshmark or NAVER or the ability of Poshmark or NAVER to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was
approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Poshmark Board in connection with
rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses
performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman
Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text
of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative
information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before September 30, 2022, the last trading day before
the date of the public announcement of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Summary of Material Financial Analysis of Goldman Sachs
Implied Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below based on the $17.90 in cash per
share of Poshmark common stock to be paid to holders of shares of Poshmark common stock (other than NAVER and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $17.90 in cash per share of Poshmark common stock relative to:
 
•
the closing price per share of Class A common stock as of September 30, 2022 (the last trading day before the date of the
public announcement of the Merger);
 
•
the VWAP per share of Class A common stock for the 30-day period ended September 30, 2022; and
 
•
the VWAP per share of Class A common stock for the 90-day period ended September 30, 2022.
The results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analyses. Goldman Sachs performed illustrative analyses of the implied present value of an
illustrative future value per share of Poshmark common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value
of Poshmark’s equity as a function of Poshmark’s financial multiples. For these analyses, Goldman Sachs used the Management Projections (including
the Tax Attributes Forecasts as provided by Poshmark’s management) for each of the fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026. Goldman Sachs first
calculated the implied future enterprise values of Poshmark as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025 in two ways: first, by
applying a range of enterprise values to Poshmark’s next twelve months (“NTM”) revenue multiples (which is referred to as
 
-48-
Table of Contents
“EV/NTM revenue multiple”) of 1.5x to 3.0x to estimates of Poshmark’s revenue as reflected in the Management Projections for each of the fiscal years
2023, 2024 and 2025 (the “Revenue Multiple Method”), and second, by applying a range of enterprise values to Poshmark’s NTM gross profit multiples
(which is referred to as “EV/NTM gross profit multiple”) of 1.75x to 3.50x to estimates of Poshmark’s gross profit for each of the fiscal years 2023, 2024
and 2025 (the “Gross Profit Multiple Method”) as reflected in the Management Projections. These illustrative EV/NTM revenue multiples and illustrative
EV/NTM gross profit multiples were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account, among other
things, current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples and EV/NTM gross profit multiples for Poshmark, respectively, during the one-month, three-
month, six-month and one-year periods ending September 30, 2022, and the period starting on the date of Poshmark’s initial public offering and ending on
September 30, 2022.
For each of the Revenue Multiple Method and the Gross Profit Multiple Method, Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of
Poshmark’s projected debt and added the amount of Poshmark’s projected cash (excluding funds payable to customers and the Suede One earnout
estimate) as of December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, each as reflected in the Management Projections, from the range of respective implied enterprise values
in order to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Poshmark as of December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025. In each case, Goldman Sachs then divided
these implied equity values by the projected number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock as of December 31, 2023, 2024 and
2025, each as provided by Poshmark’s management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Poshmark’s management, using the treasury stock method,
and NTM revenue multiples of 1.5x to 3.0x (with respect to the Revenue Multiple Method) and NTM gross profit multiples of 1.75x to 3.5x (with respect to
the Gross Profit Multiple Method), to derive a range of implied future equity values per share of Poshmark common stock.
For each of the Revenue Multiple Method and the Gross Profit Multiple Method, Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied future
equity values back one and a half years, two and a half years, and three and a half years, respectively, using an illustrative discount rate of 15.0%,
reflecting an estimate of Poshmark’s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which
requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Poshmark, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets
generally. These analyses resulted in a range of implied present values of $9.30 to $17.51 per share of Poshmark common stock under the Revenue
Multiple Method and $9.12 to $17.15 per share of Poshmark common stock under the Gross Profit Multiple Method.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Management Projections including the Tax Attributes Forecasts, Goldman Sachs
performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Poshmark to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Poshmark common stock.
Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 15.0%, reflecting estimates of Poshmark’s weighted
average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Poshmark for the third
and fourth quarters of 2022 and the fiscal years 2023 through 2032 as reflected in the Management Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal
values for Poshmark, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered
free cash flow to be generated by Poshmark, as reflected in the Management Projections (which analysis implied exit terminal year EV/revenue multiples
ranging from 1.1x to 1.8x). In addition, using discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 15.0%, reflecting an estimate of Poshmark’s weighted average cost of
capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 the estimated benefits of Poshmark’s net operating losses for the ten-and-a-half-
year period through the year ending 2032, as reflected in the Tax Attributes Forecasts (as summarized in the section titled “Certain Financial Projections”).
Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including
Poshmark’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash
tax rate and a beta for Poshmark, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of
 
-49-
Table of Contents
perpetuity growth rates for Poshmark was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the
Management Projections and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Poshmark by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described
above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Poshmark the debt of Poshmark as of June 30, 2022 of
$0 and added the amount of Poshmark’s cash (excluding funds payable to customers and the Suede One earnout estimate) of $433.5 million as of June 30,
2022, in each case, as provided by Poshmark’s management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Poshmark’s management, and added the net present
value of cash tax savings from net operating loss carryforwards, as reflected in the Management Projections including the Tax Attributes Forecasts, to
derive a range of illustrative equity values for Poshmark. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of
fully diluted outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock as of September 30, 2022, as provided by Poshmark’s management and approved for
Goldman Sachs’ use by Poshmark’s management, using the treasury method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Poshmark
common stock ranging from $12.19 to $17.71.
Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition
transactions announced during the time period from July 1, 2017 through September 30, 2022 involving a public company in the technology industry as
the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were above $500 million. For the entire period, using publicly available information,
Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in each of the 112 transactions relative to the target’s
last undisturbed closing stock price prior to a leak or rumor of transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 32% across the period. This
analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 23% and 75th percentile premium of 50% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs
applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 23% to 50% to the closing price per share of Class A common stock of $15.67 as of September 30, 2022
and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Poshmark common stock of $19.30 to $23.47.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to Poshmark or NAVER or the contemplated transaction.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Poshmark Board as to the fairness
from a financial point of view to the holders (other than NAVER and its affiliates) of shares of Poshmark common stock as of the date of the opinion, of
the $17.90 in cash per share of Poshmark common stock to be paid to such holders, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These
analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses
based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Poshmark, NAVER, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results
are materially different from those forecasts.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Poshmark and NAVER and was approved by the
Poshmark Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Poshmark during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific
amount of consideration to Poshmark or the Poshmark Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only consideration for the
Merger.

Table of Contents
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Poshmark Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Poshmark
Board in making its determination to approve the Merger. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs
attached as Annex B.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates
and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at
any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default
swaps and other financial instruments of Poshmark, NAVER, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Mayfield Fund, L.L.C.
(“Mayfield”), a significant shareholder of Poshmark, and its affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be
involved in the Merger. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial advisor to Poshmark in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations
leading to, the Merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Poshmark and/or its affiliates from time to
time for which its Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as underwriter
with respect to the initial public offering of 7,590,000 shares of Poshmark’s Class A common stock in January 2021. During the two-year period ended
October 3, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking
Division to Poshmark and/or its affiliates of approximately $7.8 million. During the two-year period ended October 3, 2022, the Investment Banking
Division of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by NAVER or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman
Sachs has recognized compensation. During the two-year period ended October 3, 2022, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been
engaged by Mayfield or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation.
Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Poshmark, NAVER, Mayfield, and their respective
affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies for which its Investment Banking Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also
may have co-invested with Mayfield and its affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Mayfield from
time to time and may do so in the future.
The Poshmark Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 22, 2022, Poshmark engaged Goldman
Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with its evaluation of a potential strategic transaction, including the Merger. The engagement letter
between Poshmark and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of
announcement, at approximately $35.2 million, $400,000 of which became payable in cash in quarterly installments with the first installment being payable
three months following the date of the engagement letter, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition,
Poshmark has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify
Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under federal securities laws.",55,60

Summary of Projections
Except for quarterly financial outlooks issued in connection with its ordinary course earnings announcements, Poshmark does not, as a matter of
course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other results due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying
assumptions, estimates and projections, especially over the longer term periods. In connection with the evaluation of the Merger, however, Poshmark’s
management
 
-51-Table of Contents
prepared the Management Projections. As more fully described in the background section, the Board directed Goldman Sachs to use and rely on the
Management Projections for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses and fairness opinion as described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned - “Opinion of Goldman Sachs.” Poshmark is including a summary of the Management Projections in order to provide Poshmark stockholders
with access to information that was made available to the Board and the Transaction Committee in connection with their evaluation of the Merger and the
Merger Consideration. The Management Projections (excluding the Tax Attributes Forecasts) were also made available to Parent, Proton Parent and
Merger Sub prior to signing the definitive agreement.

Important Information Regarding the Management Projections
The Management Projections were developed by Poshmark management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Although the
Management Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by Poshmark
management with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as
well as matters specific to Poshmark’s business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond Poshmark’s
control. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from the results forecasted in the Management Projections, including, but not limited to, Poshmark’s performance, industry
performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse changes in applicable laws,
regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various risks set forth in Poshmark’s reports filed with the SEC.
There can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the
Management Projections. The Management Projections cover several years, and such information by its nature becomes increasingly unreliable with
each successive year. In addition, the Management Projections will be affected by Poshmark’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets
over the applicable periods. The Management Projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot,
therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the Management
Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Poshmark, Goldman Sachs, NAVER, their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors, or
other representatives or anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of future events, and this
information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an
indication that the Management Projections will be necessarily predictive of actual future events.
None of Poshmark, the Board, Goldman Sachs, NAVER or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any
representation or warranty to any stockholder regarding the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Management Projections or the
ultimate performance of Poshmark relative to the Management Projections. In the view of Poshmark management, the Management Projections were
prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of Poshmark management at the time and presented, to the
best of Poshmark management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and Poshmark’s expected future financial performance as of the date
such information was prepared.
The Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information about
Poshmark contained in Poshmark’s public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned - “Where
You Can Find More Information.” In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, Poshmark stockholders
are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.
The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the published
guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), or the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to the preparation or presentation of Management Projections. The Management
Projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Poshmark management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Management Projections and,
accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.

Table of Contents
The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference into this proxy statement relates to the Company’s previously issued financial
statements. It does not extend to the Management Projections and should not be read to do so.
Adjusted EBITDA (Unburdened by SBC) and Unlevered Free Cash Flow contained in the Management Projections summarized above are “non-
GAAP financial measures,” which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures used in the Management Projections were relied upon by Goldman Sachs, as directed by the Board and as provided by Poshmark’s
management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Poshmark’s management, for purposes of its opinion and by the Board and the Transaction
Committee in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial
measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination
such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures
were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion or by the Board or the Transaction Committee in connection with their evaluation of
the Merger. Accordingly, Poshmark has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant
GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information
presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Poshmark may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by
other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required
to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative
to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The summary of such information above is included solely to give Poshmark stockholders access to the information that was made available to the
Board of Directors, the Transaction Committee, Goldman Sachs, Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub, and is not included in this proxy statement in
order to influence any Poshmark stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal
rights with respect to their shares of Poshmark common stock. In addition, the Management Projections have not been updated, corrected or otherwise
revised to reflect transactions, events, information or results after the date they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as
required by applicable securities laws, none of Poshmark, the Board, Goldman Sachs, NAVER nor any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other
representatives intend to, and each of them disclaims any obligations to update, correct or otherwise revise the Management Projections if any or all of it
has changed or changes, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. Since the Management Projections
were created, Poshmark has made publicly available its actual results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022. You should review

If the Merger Proposal is approved and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into Poshmark upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. As the surviving corporation in the Merger, Poshmark will continue to exist
following the Merger as an indirect subsidiary of Parent.
Following the Merger, all of the Poshmark common stock will be beneficially owned by Parent and none of the Company’s current stockholders will
have any direct ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the Company, the surviving corporation or Parent after the consummation of the Merger
(other than as described in the section titled “New Arrangements with Company Executive Officers”). As a result, the Company’s current stockholders
will no longer have the potential to benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the

value, of Poshmark common stock. Following the Merger, Parent will have the potential to benefit from any increase in the Company’s value and also will
bear the risk of any decrease in the Company’s value.
At the Effective Time:
 
•
Common Stock: Without any action by any stockholder, each share of Poshmark common stock that is issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Poshmark common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by
Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Proton Parent and Merger Sub) or as to which holders thereof have properly exercised their
statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Please see the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger Agreement - Consideration to be Received in the Merger.”
 
•
Vested Company Options: Each Vested Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise
price per share less than the Merger Consideration will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Class A common
stock or Company Class B common stock subject to such stock option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price per share of such stock option. Each Vested Company Option with an
exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time for no
consideration.
 
•
Unvested Company Options: Each Unvested Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
automatically cancelled and converted into a contingent right to receive the Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts, which will,
subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent or its affiliates through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same
time as the Unvested Company Option for which the Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts is exchanged would have vested
pursuant to its terms. All Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts will have the same terms and conditions (including with respect to
vesting) as applied to the Unvested Company Option for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of
the Merger or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are
appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts. Each Unvested Company Option with an
exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time for no
consideration.
 
•
Vested Company RSUs: Each Vested Company RSU will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total number
of shares of Company Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such Vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.
 
•
Unvested Company RSUs: Other than as set forth in “New Arrangements with Company Executive Officers” below, each Unvested
Company RSU will, at the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled and converted into a contingent right to receive the Cash Replacement
Company RSU Amounts which will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent or its affiliates through the applicable vesting
dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU for which such Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts is
exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms. All Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts will have the same terms and

2021 ESPP: No later than three business days prior to the Effective Time, each purchase right outstanding as of October 3, 2022, under the
2021 ESPP will be exercised, with accumulated contributions used to purchase shares of Company Class A common stock in accordance
with the terms of the 2021 ESPP on such final exercise date. All shares of Company Class A common stock purchased on such final exercise
date will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The 2021 ESPP will be terminated effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Poshmark Class A common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “POSH.” Following
the consummation of the Merger, Poshmark Class A common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. In addition, the registration of Poshmark Class A
common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated and the Company will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with
respect to its common stock. Termination of registration of Poshmark common stock under the Exchange Act will reduce the information required to be
furnished by the Company to the Company’s stockholders and the SEC, and will make provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file
annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders’ meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer
applicable to the Company.

If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, the Company’s
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Poshmark common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain
an independent public company, Poshmark Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, Poshmark Class A common stock will
continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, the Company will continue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with respect to its common
stock and the Company’s stockholders will continue to own their shares of Poshmark common stock and will continue to be subject to the same general
risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of Poshmark common stock.
If the Merger is not completed, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of
Poshmark common stock, including the risk that the market price of Poshmark Class A common stock may decline to the extent that the current market
price of Poshmark Class A common stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger is not completed, there is no
assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Company will be offered or that the business, operations, financial condition, earnings or
prospects of the Company will not be adversely affected. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, the Company is permitted to
terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an alternative transaction and may be obligated to pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee.

these interests in reaching the determination to approve the Merger Agreement and to declare that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other

Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions were used:
 
•
the Merger Consideration is $17.90;
 
•
except as set forth below, each executive officer’s employment is terminated by the Company without “cause” or by the executive officer for
“good reason” (as such terms are defined in the Severance Plan (as defined below)), in each case, immediately following the Effective Time;
 
•
each director and executive officer holds the outstanding equity awards that were held by them as of October 18, 2022, the latest practicable
date before the filing of this proxy statement; and
 
•
the amounts set forth below regarding executive officer compensation are based on compensation levels as of October 18, 2022.
The Company’s current executive officers are:
 
•
Manish Chandra, our Chief Executive Officer
 
•
Rodrigo Brumana, our Chief Financial Officer
 
•
John McDonald, our Chief Operating Officer
The below disclosures do not include information regarding Kapil Agrawal, our former Interim Chief Financial Officer, or Anan Kashyap, our former
Chief Financial Officer, each of whom was a named executive officer in the last proxy statement that we filed with the SEC. Mr. Agrawal ceased to be our
Interim Chief Financial Officer in December 2021 upon the hiring of Mr. Brumana, and transitioned to serving in an advisory role until his employment with
the Company ended in June 2022. Mr. Kashyap’s employment with the Company terminated in August 2021. Such individuals do not currently hold any
outstanding equity awards and are, therefore, ineligible for any of the payments or benefits described below.
The Company’s non-employee directors (who constitute the entire Board other than our Chief Executive Officer, Manish Chandra) are:
 
•
Ebony Beckwith
 
•
Navin Chaddha
 
•
Jeff Epstein
 
•
Jenny Ming
 
•
Hans Tung
 
•
Serena Williams
The below disclosures do not include information regarding John Marren who resigned from the Board in March 2022, because he does not
currently hold any outstanding equity awards and is, therefore, ineligible for any of the payments or benefits described below.
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards and the 2021 ESPP
The Company’s non-employee directors and executive officers hold Company Options and Company RSUs under the Company’s 2011 Stock
Option and Grant Plan and the Company’s 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan” and the “2021 Plan,” respectively). In addition, certain
of the Company’s executive officers participate in the 2021 ESPP.

Pursuant to the Company’s Executive Severance Plan for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Executive Officers in place prior to the Merger (the
“Severance Plan”), if the employment of an executive officer of the Company is terminated by the Company without “cause” (other than on account of
death or “disability”) or by the executive officer for “good reason” (each as defined in the Severance Plan) during the period beginning on the date three
months prior to a Change in Control and ending 12 months after the date of such Change in Control, then the Company Options and Company RSUs held
by such executive officer are subject to 100% accelerated vesting and exercisability. “Change in Control” is defined in the Severance Plan and the
consummation of the Merger meets such definition.
The Company’s non-employee directors hold Company Options and Company RSUs under both the 2011 Plan and 2021 Plan. Pursuant to the
Director Compensation Policy in place prior to the Merger, all Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs held by the non-employee
directors of the Company will become fully vested and exercisable in connection with the Merger.
Each of the Company’s non-employee directors and executive officers will be entitled to receive, for each share of Company Class A common stock
or Class B common stock he or she holds as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the same Merger Consideration in cash, and in the same manner, as
other holders of the Company Class A common stock or Class B common stock. For additional information regarding the beneficial ownership of
Company Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by each of the Company’s non-employee directors and executive officers and the
beneficial ownership of Company Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by all non-employee directors and executive officers as a group,
please see the section of this proxy statement titled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.”
In addition to the vesting acceleration rights set forth above pursuant to the Company’s equity plans in place prior to the Merger, at the Effective
Time, all Company equity awards, including awards held by our non-employee directors and executive officers, that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will generally be subject to the following treatment pursuant to the Merger Agreement:
Company Options
At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share less than the
Merger Consideration will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable
withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such Vested
Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option.
At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share less than the
Merger Consideration will be automatically cancelled and converted into a contingent right to receive the Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts,
which Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent or its affiliates through the applicable
vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option for which such Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts were
exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms. All Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts will have the same terms and conditions (including
with respect to vesting) as applied to the Unvested Company Option for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of
the Merger or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform
the administration of the Cash Replacement Company Option Amounts.
Each Vested Company Option and Unvested Company Option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration
will be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time for no consideration.

Table of Contents
Company RSUs
Each Vested Company RSU will, at the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total number of shares of Company
Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such Vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Other than as set forth in “New Arrangements with Company Executive Officers” below, each Unvested Company RSU will, at the Effective Time,
be automatically cancelled and converted into a contingent right to receive the Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts, which Cash Replacement
Company RSU Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent or its affiliates through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be
payable at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU for which such Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts were exchanged would have vested
pursuant to its terms. All Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts will have the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as
applied to the Unvested Company RSU for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Merger or for such other
administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of the
Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts.
In addition, Ms. Beckwith elected to defer settlement of all of her previously vested Company RSUs pursuant to the Deferred Compensation
Program and Mr. Epstein elected to defer settlement of any Company RSUs granted to him after March 2021 pursuant to the Deferred Compensation
Program. In accordance with the Deferred Compensation Program, all of Ms. Beckwith’s and Mr. Epstein’s deferred Company RSUs will settle within 30
days of the Effective Time, such that Ms. Beckwith and Mr. Epstein will receive upon such settlement an amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the total number of their deferred Company RSUs of Company Class A common stock.
2021 ESPP
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) except for the offering period in effect as of October 3, 2022, no new offering periods will be authorized or
commenced under the 2021 ESPP, (ii) no new participants will commence participation in the 2021 ESPP, (iii) no participant will be permitted to increase
such participant’s payroll deduction election or contribution rates or to make separate non-payroll contributions, except as may be required by law, (iv)
each purchase right outstanding under the 2021 ESPP as of October 3, 2022, will be exercised no later than three business days prior to the Effective Time,
(v) the accumulated contributions will be used to purchase shares of Company Class A common stock in accordance with the terms of the 2021 ESPP on
such final exercise date, and (vi) the 2021 ESPP will be terminated effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. All shares of Company Class A
common stock purchased on such final exercise date will, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.
Quantification of Potential Payments for Equity Awards
The table below sets forth (i) the number of Vested Company Options, Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs, as applicable,
as of October 18, 2022, the assumed date of the Merger solely for the purposes of this disclosure, held by each current executive officer and non-
employee director, and (ii) the estimated value of those awards (on a pre-tax basis). These values have been calculated assuming the price of a share of
Company Class A and Class B common stock is $17.90, which represents the per share price of the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this table, we
have also assumed that the employment of all executive officers will terminate immediately following the Merger (based on the assumed date of October
18, 2022).

the 2021 Plan.
Severance Entitlements
Each of the Company’s executive officers is a participant in the Severance Plan, which provides for certain severance payments and benefits in
connection with certain terminations of employment.
The Severance Plan provides that upon a (a) termination by the Company other than for “cause,” death, or “disability” or (b) resignation for “good
reason,” (each as defined in the Severance Plan), in each case, within the change in control period (i.e., the period beginning three months prior to, and
ending 12 months after, a “change in control,” as defined in the Severance Plan, which includes the Merger), the participants will be entitled to receive,
subject to the execution and delivery of an effective release of claims in favor of the Company, (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to 18 months of base
salary for Mr. Chandra and 12 months of base salary for Messrs. Brumana and McDonald, (ii) a monthly cash payment equal to our contribution towards
100% of requisite premiums for continued medical, dental and vision insurance benefit coverage for up to 18 months for Mr. Chandra and up to 12 months
for Messrs. Brumana and McDonald, (iii) a pro rata target annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, based on the number of days in
such year prior to the termination date of such executive officer, and (iv) full accelerated vesting of all outstanding and unvested equity awards held by
such executive officer; provided, that any unvested and outstanding equity awards subject to performance conditions will be deemed satisfied (if at all) at
the target levels specified in the applicable award agreements.
The foregoing severance payments and benefits under the Severance Plan are subject to the delivery of an effective separation and release
agreement by the executive officer containing, among other provisions, a general release of claims in favor of the Company. The Severance Plan does not
provide for any tax gross-up payments. If any amounts or benefits to be paid or provided under the Severance Plan would cause payments or benefits (or
other compensation) to not be fully deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes because of
 
-60-
Table of Contents
Section 280G of the Code, or any successor provision thereto (or that would subject the executive officer to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code, or any successor provision thereto), then such payments and benefits (and other compensation) will be reduced to the extent necessary such that
no portion of such payments or benefits (or other compensation) will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code; however such a
reduction will be made only if, by reason of such reduction, the executive officer’s net after-tax benefit exceeds the net after-tax benefit such executive
officer would realize if such reduction were not made.
For purpose of the following table, we have assumed that the employment of all executive officers will terminate immediately following the Merger
in a manner that entitles them to benefits under the Severance Plan. The estimated value of the severance payments and benefits, excluding equity
acceleration, assuming the Merger occurs on October 18, 2022, for each of our executive officers is set forth below.

280G Mitigation Actions
Under the Merger Agreement, the Company may take certain actions before the Effective Time to mitigate the amount of potential “excess
parachute payments” for “disqualified individuals” (each as defined in Section 280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”)), including the executive officers. Such actions may include obtaining third party valuations of restrictive covenants and accelerating certain
pending payments into 2022. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Company has not yet approved any specific actions to mitigate any impact of
Section 280G of the Code on the Company or any disqualified individuals. No executive officer is entitled to receive gross-ups or tax reimbursements from
the Company with respect to any potential excise taxes.
The Company’s Non-Employee Director Compensation
Under the Merger Agreement, the Company may continue to pay non-employee members of the Board their annual fees, cash and equity retainers,
reimbursements and stipends, in each case, without proration and in accordance with the terms of the Director Compensation Policy. As described above
in the section entitled “Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” all Company Options and Company RSUs held by
non-employee directors will accelerate and fully vest in connection with the closing of the Merger.
Potential Future Arrangements
As of the date of this proxy statement, other than as set forth below (including in the “Employee Benefits Matters”), none of the Company’s non-
employee directors of executive officers has entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to
purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however, certain executive
officers of the Company may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with, Parent, the Company or their respective affiliates regarding
employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates.

New Arrangements with Company Executive Officers
Employment Term Sheet
On October 3, 2022, Mr. Chandra entered into a binding employment term sheet with Merger Sub (the “Employment Term Sheet”) pursuant to
which Mr. Chandra will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the surviving corporation and will be appointed to the board of directors of Proton Parent,
effective as of the date on which the closing occurs (the “closing date”). Under the Employment Term Sheet, Mr. Chandra will be entitled to an annual
base salary of $425,000 and be eligible for a target annual bonus equal to 100% of his base salary.
Under the Employment Term Sheet, all Unvested Company RSUs held by Mr. Chandra, valued at approximately $10,000,000, will fully vest as of the
closing date and be converted into the right to receive on the day following the closing date a number of fully vested shares of Proton Parent common
stock having an equivalent fair market value as of the closing date.
Mr. Chandra will also be granted an option to purchase a number of shares of Proton Parent common stock (the “New Hire Options”), having an
aggregate grant date fair market value equal to (a) (i) the Company’s equity value as of the closing date, divided by (ii) the Company’s enterprise value as
of the closing date, multiplied by (b) $32,500,000. By way of example for illustrative purposes only, if the Company’s equity value as of the closing date is
$1,634 million (which is what it approximately was as of the date of signing of the Merger Agreement), and the Company’s enterprise value as of the
closing date is $1,200 million (which is what it approximately was as of the date of signing of the Merger Agreement), then the aggregate grant date fair
market value of the shares subject to the New Hire Options would be $44,254,167. The exercise price of the New Hire Options shall be equal to the fair
market value as of the date of grant of the underlying shares of Proton Parent common stock. The New Hire Options will vest as follows, subject to Mr.
Chandra’s continued employment as CEO through the applicable vesting date:

25% upon Proton Parent (or the surviving corporation) filing a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC with respect to an initial
public offering of Proton Parent (or the surviving corporation) (“IPO”),
 
•
25% upon consummation of an IPO, and
 
•
50% on the 180th day following consummation of an IPO.
Upon the occurrence of a change in control, any unvested New Hire Options will become fully vested, subject to Mr. Chandra’s continued
employment as Chief Executive Officer through such change in control. In the event of a termination of Mr. Chandra’s employment (i) by the surviving
corporation without cause, (ii) due to Mr. Chandra’s death or disability or (iii) by Mr. Chandra with good reason, any outstanding and unvested New Hire
Options will remain outstanding and eligible to vest if a vesting date (as described above) or a change in control occurs during the 12-month period
following such termination.
Additionally, if (i) neither a change in control nor an IPO has occurred by the fifth anniversary of the closing date (the “Put Date”) and (ii) the
enterprise value of Proton Parent as of the Put Date is at least equal to 1.5 times the enterprise value of Proton Parent as of the closing date, then Mr.
Chandra will have the right, during the one-year period following the Put Date, to require Proton Parent to repurchase all of the shares of Proton Parent
common stock held by Mr. Chandra as of the date of exercise of the put right (including any shares of Proton Parent common stock issuable upon the
exercise of unforfeited New Hire Options, subject to certain exceptions) at the most recent fair market valuation of such shares. The put right expires on
the earliest to occur of an IPO, a change in control and the sixth anniversary of the closing date.
In the event of a termination of Mr. Chandra’s employment by the surviving corporation without cause or by Mr. Chandra with good reason,
subject to Mr. Chandra signing and not revoking a release in favor of the surviving corporation, Mr. Chandra will receive severance consisting of: (i) 12
months (or 18 months, if
 
-62-

terminated within 12 months of the closing date) of base salary, (ii) prorated target annual bonus for the year of termination and (iii) 12 months (or 18
months, if terminated within 12 months of the closing date) of COBRA continuation coverage. These severance benefits will, as of the closing, supersede
and replace any entitlement Mr. Chandra previously had under the Severance Plan.
The Employment Term Sheet also provides that the parties will negotiate in good faith to enter into an employment agreement prior to the closing
date.
Holdback Agreement
In connection with the Employment Term Sheet, Mr. Chandra entered into a Holdback Agreement pursuant to which $20,000,000 of the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to Mr. Chandra (the “Pre-Tax Holdback Amount”), less the amount of taxes owed by Mr . Chandra on the Pre-Tax
holdback Amount (such amount, the “Post-Tax Holdback Amount”), will be placed into an escrow account at the closing date. The Post-Tax Holdback
Amount will be paid to Mr. Chandra in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date, subject to Mr. Chandra’s
continued employment with Parent or any of its subsidiaries through each applicable payment date. If Mr. Chandra’s employment with Parent or any of its
subsidiaries is terminated prior to the third anniversary of the closing date (i) by the surviving corporation without cause, (ii) due to Mr. Chandra’s death
or disability or (iii) by Mr. Chandra with good reason, then any remaining portion of the Post-Tax Holdback Amount held in escrow will no longer be
subject to forfeiture and will be paid to Mr. Chandra within 30 days following such termination. Upon any termination of his employment other than as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence, any portion of the Post-Tax Holdback Amount that has not become deliverable as of such termination will be
forfeited.
In connection with the negotiation of the Employment Term Sheet and Holdback Agreement, Mr. Chandra retained his own legal counsel and the
Poshmark Board approved reimbursement of the costs and expenses to be incurred by Mr. Chandra in connection therewith up to an amount equal to
$75,000.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Poshmark’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and
coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. See “The Merger Agreement - Indemnification of Directors and Officers and
Insurance.”

The following discussion summarizes certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of Poshmark common stock who
receive cash in exchange for shares of Poshmark common stock pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is for general informational purposes only and
does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of the Merger. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the
U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement
and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect
the accuracy of the statements set forth herein. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought,
and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (referred to herein as the “IRS”) regarding any of the tax issues discussed herein.
There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences of the Merger described in this proxy statement.
This discussion assumes that holders of Poshmark common stock hold their shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a
particular holder of Poshmark common stock in light of such holder’s individual circumstances, nor does it address U.S. state or local,
 
-63-Table of Contents
non-U.S., or estate or gift taxes, the alternative minimum tax, the rules regarding qualified small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of the
Code, the Medicare tax on net investment income or any other aspect of any U.S. federal tax other than the income tax. This discussion also does not
address tax considerations that may be relevant to holders of Poshmark common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws,
such as, for example, financial institutions, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, mutual funds, partnerships or other entities or arrangements
classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities and their partners or members, S corporations, tax-exempt
organizations, governmental organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market
method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S.
federal income tax, U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired their Poshmark common stock
through the exercise of Company stock options or otherwise as compensation, holders who hold their Poshmark common stock as part of a hedge,
straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, real estate
investment trusts, regulated investment companies, holders deemed to sell their shares of Poshmark common stock under the constructive sale
provisions of the Code, persons who own (directly, indirectly or constructively) an equity interest in Parent or the surviving corporation and holders who
exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger under the DGCL.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Poshmark common stock, the tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership
holding Poshmark common stock or a partner of a partnership holding Poshmark common stock, you are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger relevant to you.
This discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice. Holders of Poshmark common stock are urged to consult their tax
advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them in light of their particular circumstances, as well as any tax
consequences of the Merger arising under the U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws, “golden
parachute” rules, or under any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Poshmark common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, is:
 
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
•
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws
of the United States or any political subdivision thereof;
 
•
a trust if (1) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons as
described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person (within the meaning of the Code); and
 
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Poshmark common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, an individual, a corporation, a trust or an estate that is not a U.S. holder.",72,73

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Poshmark common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss
 
-64-Table of Contents
for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the Merger (determined before the
deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. A U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in a share of Poshmark common stock will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for such share. Such gain or
loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as
of the date of the closing. Long-term capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for a reduced rate of
federal income taxation. Short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss
must be calculated separately for each block of Poshmark common stock (i.e., common stock acquired at the same time and at the same price in a single
transaction). U.S. holders who own separate blocks of Poshmark common stock should consult their tax advisors with respect to these rules. 
A U.S. holder may, unless an exception applies, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) with respect
to the cash received pursuant to the Merger, unless such U.S. holder provides its correct taxpayer identification number (referred to as the “TIN”) on IRS
Form W-9 (or if appropriate, a substitute or successor form) and certifies under penalties of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such U.S. holder is
not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to
the IRS in a timely manner and other requirements are satisfied.

Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax
unless:
 
•
the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States
maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a
U.S. holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such corporation may be subject to branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (or
such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, subject to certain adjustments;
 
•
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the aggregate in the taxable
year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to a 30% tax (or tax at
such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on the non-U.S. holder’s net gain realized in the Merger, which
may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder, if any (even though the individual is not considered a resident of
the United States), provided that such non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses; or
 
•
the Company is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the
shorter of (1) the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger and (2) the non-U.S. holder’s holding period in the Poshmark common
stock, and, at any time during such period, the non-U.S. holder owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of the
outstanding Poshmark common stock. Generally, a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation only if the fair market value of its
U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other
assets used or held for use in a trade or business. The Company does not believe that it was and does not expect that it will be a “United
States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of
the Merger.
 
-65-Table of Contents
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) with
respect to the cash received by such non-U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger, unless such non-U.S. holder provides the paying agent with an applicable
and properly executed IRS Form W-8 certifying under penalties of perjury the holder’s non-U.S. status (and the payor or applicable withholding agent
does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person as defined under the Code) or otherwise establishes an
exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange
agreement to the taxing authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Rather, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability, if any, provided that the non-U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner and other applicable requirements are
satisfied. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.

U.S. Antitrust
The obligations of Parent and the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR
Act. Under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until notifications have been filed and
certain information has been furnished to the FTC and the DOJ and the specified waiting period has expired or has been terminated. The Company and
Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC on October 18, 2022, and the
applicable waiting period commenced on October 19, 2022. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59PM ET on November 18, 2022. The FTC
and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the Merger on antitrust grounds after the expiration of the applicable waiting period.
In addition, the Merger may be reviewed by the state attorneys general in the various states in which Parent and the Company operate. These
authorities may claim that there is authority, under the applicable state and federal antitrust laws and regulations, to investigate and/or seek to prohibit
the Merger under the circumstances and based on the standards set forth in applicable state laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that one or
more state attorneys general will not attempt to file an antitrust action to challenge the Merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, neither Parent nor
the Company has been notified by any state attorney general indicating any plan to review the Merger.
The Merger Agreement includes covenants obligating each of the parties, with respect to filings under the HSR Act, to supply (or cause to be
supplied) information that may be required to make such filings or any additional information that may be required or requested by the FTC, DOJ, or other
governmental authorities, to cooperate and coordinate (and to cause their respective affiliates to cooperate and coordinate) with the other to

make such filings, and to use their reasonable best efforts to take, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable. For more information regarding these

In connection with the Merger Agreement, four complaints have been filed as individual actions in United States District Courts. One complaint
has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned O’Dell v. Poshmark, Inc., et al., 22-cv-9799 (filed
November 16, 2022). Three complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and are captioned Olive v.
Poshmark, Inc., et al.¸ 3:22-cv-07337 (filed November 21, 2022), Bushansky v. Poshmark, Inc., et al., 3:22-cv-07373 (filed November 22, 2022), and Da
Camara v. Poshmark, Inc., et al., 3:22-cv-07379 (filed November 22, 2022). The foregoing complaints are referred to as the “Merger Actions”.
The Merger Actions generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on November 15, 2022 misrepresents
and/or omits certain purportedly material information relating to the Company’s financial projections, the analyses performed by the financial advisor to
the Poshmark Board in connection with the Merger, potential conflicts of interest of the Company’s officers and directors, and the events that led to the
signing of the Merger Agreement, among other things. The Merger Actions assert violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder, against all defendants (the Company and its Board of Directors) and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against
Poshmark’s Board. The Merger Actions seek, among other things, an injunction enjoining the stockholder vote on the Merger and the consummation of
the Merger unless and until certain additional information is disclosed to Poshmark stockholders, and costs of the action, including plaintiffs’ attorneys’
fees and experts’ fees. Certain demand letters have also been sent to the Company by purported stockholders making similar disclosure allegations.
The Company cannot predict the outcome of the Merger Actions. The Company believes that the Merger Actions are without merit. If additional
similar complaints are filed, absent new or significantly different allegations, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings.",76,76

and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We urge you to carefully read this entire proxy statement, including the annexes and the other
documents to which we have referred you. You should also review the section titled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
The Merger Agreement has been included to provide you with information regarding its terms, and we recommend that you read it in its entirety.
The Merger Agreement is a contractual document that establishes and governs the legal relations between the Company, Parent, Proton Parent and
Merger Sub and allocates risks between the parties, with respect to the Merger, the other agreements contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date of the
Merger Agreement or other specific dates specified in the Merger Agreement. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and
covenants were made for purposes of the contract between the respective parties and are subject to representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by a
confidential disclosure letter made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing
these matters as facts), and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors,
security holders, or securities laws. Investors and security holders are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of
any party to the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date
of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures.
The representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and the description of them in this proxy statement should not be read alone but
instead should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the reports, statements and filings the Company publicly files with the SEC.

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent agreed to select, or cause Proton Parent to select, a nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”). At or prior to the closing of the Merger, Parent will or will
cause Proton Parent to deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent an amount of cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Poshmark common stock. The Company will, at the written request of Parent, deposit with the Payment Agent at the closing such
portion of such aggregate consideration from the Company’s cash denominated in United States dollars and held in United States bank accounts as
specified in such request.

Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event no later than three business days), Parent (or Proton Parent) and the surviving corporation
will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Poshmark common
stock that are held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent, Proton Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiaries, as applicable) of one or
more certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock (other than any
shares of Poshmark common stock that are held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent, Proton Parent, Merger Sub or any other
subsidiaries, as applicable) (the “Certificates”) (i) a letter of transmittal (which will be in customary form and which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent) and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Poshmark common stock
formerly represented by the Certificates. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Poshmark common stock represented by
such Certificates by (y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered will be canceled. With respect to record holders of uncertificated
shares of Poshmark common stock (other than any shares of Poshmark common stock that are held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by
Parent, Proton Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiaries thereof), upon the Payment Agent’s receipt of an “agent’s message” (or such other evidence
as the paying agent may reasonably request), the holder of such uncertificated shares will be entitled to receive in exchange an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Poshmark common stock represented by such holder’s transferred
uncertificated shares by (2) the Merger Consideration, and the transferred uncertificated shares will be canceled.
No interest will be paid or accrue on the cash payable to any holder of a Certificate or uncertificated share. Until so surrendered or transferred,
outstanding Certificates and uncertificated shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof.
As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is no less than five business
days after the closing date, the holders of Unvested Option and Vested RSUs will be paid by Poshmark or the surviving corporation, through its payroll
system or payroll provider, all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of such equity awards that are canceled and converted into a cash
payment, less any required withholding.
The Company will take all actions necessary to effect the cancellation and conversion of Company Options, Unvested RSUs and to effectuate the
treatment of the 2021 ESPP upon the Effective Time and otherwise to give effect to the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement.
Each of the surviving corporation, Merger Sub, Parent and the Payment Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts
otherwise payable to any person pursuant to the Merger Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under applicable law
with respect to taxes. Any amounts so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority will be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, Poshmark and
its subsidiaries agreed to not, and agreed to cause the directors, officers and employees of it and its subsidiaries not to, and to instruct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries’ other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
 
•
solicit, initiate, propose, induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any inquiry,
proposal, indication of interest or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;
 
•
furnish to any person (other than Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub or any designees of Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub) any non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or afford to any person access to the business, properties, assets,

any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than certain Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements) (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”). “Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement” means any confidentiality agreement (i) containing terms that are not less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company or less restrictive in the aggregate of a third party than those contained in the confidentiality agreement, except that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provision or otherwise prohibit the making of any Acquisition
Proposal and (ii) that does not prohibit the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with the no-solicitation
provision of the Merger Agreement or otherwise prohibit the Company from complying with its obligations under the no-solicitation
provision.
The Company also agreed to, within 24 hours following the execution of the Merger Agreement, request that all non-public information previously
provided by or on behalf of Poshmark or any of its subsidiaries to any third party with whom a confidentiality agreement was entered into during the
twelve-month period immediately preceding the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to a potential Acquisition Transaction be returned or
destroyed, and agreed to immediately upon the execution of the Merger Agreement cease and cause its subsidiaries and each of its and its subsidiaries’
directors, officers and employees to, and instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries’ other representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions, communications or negotiations with any person (other than the parties to the Merger Agreement and
their respective representatives) relating to an Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries, proposals, indications of interest or offers that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal) and shut off all access granted to any such person to any electronic data room maintained by the Company
with respect to the Transactions or any Acquisition Proposal (or inquires, proposals, indications of interest or offers that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal).
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
will enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and will not waive, terminate or modify, any provision of any standstill or similar

make a private Acquisition Proposal to the Poshmark Board would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
If, at any time on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the
Company’s receipt of the Poshmark stockholder approval, Poshmark and the Poshmark Board receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Poshmark Board
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) (i) either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (ii) did not result from a breach of the no-shop provisions, subject to compliance with the no-shop provisions in the Merger
Agreement, the Company is entitled to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with and furnish any non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal. The Company will provide to Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub
any non-public information, data and/or access that is provided to any person given such information, data and/or access that was not previously made
available to Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub prior to or promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following the time it is provided to such person.
From and after the date of the Merger Agreement, Poshmark agreed to as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent
in writing of Poshmark’s receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries, proposals, indications of interest or offers that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal). Such notice must include the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, including, if applicable, complete copies of any written documentation or materials. The Company
must also keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours), of changes to the status and terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal and any changes to the status of any related discussions or negotiations.
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Acquisition Proposal” means any bona fide written offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal
by Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub) relating to an Acquisition Transaction. Furthermore, the term “Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction
or series of related transactions (other than the Merger) involving:
 
•
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of shares of more than 20% of the outstanding Poshmark common stock or voting power
of Poshmark, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a person or group beneficially
owning more than 20% of the Poshmark common stock outstanding or voting power of Poshmark after giving effect to the consummation of
such tender or exchange offer;
 
•
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of more than 20% of the consolidated assets, net revenue or net income of the Company
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof);
 
•
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other
transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group (or stockholders of any such person or
group) would hold, directly or indirectly, shares of Poshmark common stock representing more than 20% of the equity interests or voting
power of the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction; or
 
•
any combination of the foregoing.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will not be deemed an Acquisition
Proposal.

Table of Contents
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Superior Proposal” means any unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition
Transaction first made after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from a breach of the no-solicitation provision of the Merger Agreement
on terms that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) would be more
favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company stockholders than the Merger (taking into account any legal, regulatory, financial, timing,
financing and other aspects of such proposal that the Company Board considers relevant and any revisions to the Merger Agreement made or proposed
in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination). For purposes of the reference to an “Acquisition Proposal” in this definition, all references to
“20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50%”.
Poshmark Board Recommendation Change
The Poshmark Board may not (any of the following actions, a “Company Board Recommendation Change”):
 
•
(i) withhold, withdraw, amend, or fail to make when required by the Merger Agreement, or resolve or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
amend, or fail to make when required by the Merger Agreement, its recommendation to Poshmark stockholders to adopt the Merger
Agreement (the “Company Board Recommendation”), or (ii) qualify or modify (or resolve or publicly propose to qualify or modify) the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent;
 
•
adopt, approve or recommend or publicly declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal;
 
•
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in this proxy statement;
 
•
fail to publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company’s stockholders prior to the earlier of (i)
three business days prior to the date of the meeting of its stockholders (the “Company Stockholders Meeting”) and (ii) the tenth business
day following the commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act (or the fifth business day following public disclosure
of such material modifications, as applicable) if an Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer is commenced; or
 
•
other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within five business days after Parent so requests in writing (with the Company having no obligation to make such
reaffirmation on more than two separate occasions per acquisition proposal and one occasion per material modification thereto).
In addition, neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company may enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Poshmark stockholder approval, the
Poshmark Board or any committee of the Poshmark Board may make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to (i) a Superior Proposal
that did not result from a breach of the no-solicitation provision of the Merger Agreement, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, or (ii) any
material change, event, effect, development or circumstance occurring or becoming known after the date of the Merger Agreement that was not known or
reasonably foreseeable or the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board on the date of the Merger
Agreement and does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or changes in the stock price of the Company, in and of itself,
any breach by the Company of the Merger Agreement or the mere fact that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published financial projections
or forecasts for any period ending on or after the date of the Merger Agreement; or changes in general economic or geopolitical conditions, or changes in
conditions in the global, international or U.S. economy generally (an “Intervening

Event”), if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject in each case to compliance with the procedures described below.
In the case of a Superior Proposal, no adverse recommendation change and/or termination of the Merger Agreement may be made:
 
•
until after the fifth business day following written notice from the Company to Parent advising Parent that the Poshmark Board intends to
resolve to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and specifying the reasons, including the identity of the third party making,
such Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and copies of all agreements, term sheets, financing
commitments and any other documents or written communications relating to such Superior Proposal (with any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal requiring a new notice of superior proposal with a new notice period of three
business days); and
 
•
unless during such five business day period (or three business day period following an amended proposal), the Company agreed to
negotiate with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement such that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change and/or terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, would no longer be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable law.
In the case of an Intervening Event, no adverse recommendation change may be made:
 
•
until after the fifth business day following written notice from the Company to Parent advising Parent that the Poshmark Board or any
committee of the Poshmark Board intends to take such action and specifying the basis for such change in the Company Board
Recommendation;
 
•
unless, prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its representatives, during such five business
day period, agreed to negotiate with Parent and its representatives in good faith to enable Parent to propose adjustments to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement such that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would no longer be
inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
 
•
unless, at the end of such five business day period and prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
Board has considered in good faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the terms of this Agreement, and has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change would continue to be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law if such changes
proposed by Parent were to be given effect.
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Alternative Acquisition Agreement” means any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

The Company has agreed, in consultation with Parent, to conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement to enable a record date to be set for a special meeting of its stockholders for the purpose
of obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger (the “Special Meeting”). The Company agreed to hold the Special Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the clearance of the proxy statement by the SEC.
The Company may, and will, at the request of Parent, postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting:
 
•
to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the stockholder approval (provided that (i) such postponement or adjournment
will not occur more than two times, in each case, be so delayed by more than ten business days each and (ii) in no event shall the record
date of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed without Parent’s written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed);
 
•
for the absence of a quorum (provided that (i) such postponement or adjournment will not occur more than two times, in each case, be so
delayed by more than ten business days each and (ii) in no event shall the record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed
without Parent’s written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
 
•
if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the stockholder meeting by applicable law or a request from the SEC or its staff; or
 
•
to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that is required by applicable law is provided
the Company’s stockholders for the amount of time required by law in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting (provided that the
stockholder meeting will not be so delayed by more than 5 business days).
Unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company has agreed to use reasonable efforts to solicit from stockholders
of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Unless the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, the Company will submit
the Merger Agreement for a vote by its stockholders at the Special Meeting even if the Poshmark Board (or a committee thereof) has effected a Company
Board Recommendation Change.
The Company has agreed to ensure that the proxy statement will not, on the date it is first disseminated to stockholders of the Company or at the
time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. However, the Company assumes no
responsibility with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the proxy
statement. Parent and Merger Sub agreed to ensure that such information supplied by them for inclusion in the proxy statement will not, on the date it is
first disseminated to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. However, Parent and Merger Sub assume no responsibility with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the proxy statement.
If at any time prior to the Special Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent, Proton Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the proxy statement or any other required Company filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, then the party that

discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information will be
promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate party and, to the extent required by applicable law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the
Company’s stockholders.
Subject to applicable law, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the proxy statement to be disseminated to Poshmark’s
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in no event more than three business days, following the filing thereof with the SEC and
confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the proxy statement, which confirmation will be deemed to have
occurred if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company by 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth calendar day following such filing with the
SEC that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the proxy statement.

As of the Effective Time, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will, and Parent and Proton Parent will cause the surviving corporation and
its subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of Poshmark and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements in effect
as of October 3, 2022 between the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former
directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of Poshmark or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other
hand (each, together with such person’s heirs, executors and administrators, an “Indemnified Person” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In
addition, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving company or any of its subsidiaries will, and Parent and Proton Parent will
cause the surviving company and its subsidiaries to, cause all the organizational documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
advancement and reimbursement of expenses provisions set forth in the organizational documents as of October 3, 2022, which provisions will not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable law.
For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will, and Parent and Proton Parent will cause the surviving
corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (including with respect to advancement of expenses and
attorneys’ fees and advancing such expenses and fees without requiring any preliminary determination of entitlement subject to such individual’s
affirmation or undertaking as contemplated by the DGCL), each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise
in connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, to the extent that such legal
proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to the fact that an Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of Poshmark or any of its subsidiaries; any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, prior to the Effective time, in such
Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or taken at the request of Poshmark or
such subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another person (including any
 
-84-Table of Contents
employee benefit plan), regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time); and the
Merger, as well as any actions taken prior to the Effective Time by Poshmark, Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger.
If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a good faith
claim for indemnification, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. No Indemnified Person will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any legal proceeding for
which he or she has submitted or may submit an indemnification claim without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).
For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will, and Parent and Proton Parent will cause the surviving
corporation to, maintain in effect Poshmark’s current directors’ and officers’ liability and similar insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
Poshmark’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance; provided that in no event will the surviving corporation be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year, which amount is referred to as the maximum
annual premium. If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the maximum annual premium, then the surviving corporation will be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the maximum annual premium from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as Poshmark’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. In satisfaction of the foregoing obligations, prior to the
Effective Time Poshmark may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Poshmark’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost
for such “tail” policy does not exceed the maximum annual premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the
surviving corporation will (and Parent and Proton Parent will cause the surviving corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect for a
period of no less than six years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations under such “tail” policy. If the Company is unable to obtain
the “tail” policy and Parent and Proton Parent or the surviving corporation are unable to obtain the insurance described above for an annual cost less
than or equal to the maximum annual premium, Parent and Proton Parent will cause the surviving corporation to instead obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for an aggregate annual premium equal to the maximum annual premium.

For a period of 12 months following the Effective Time, Parent agreed to provide each employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries who
continues to be an employee of Parent or one of its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) immediately following the Effective Time (a
“Continuing Employee”) with (i) base salary or wage rate and short-term (i.e., annual or shorter) cash incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) employee benefits (excluding, in each
case, nonqualified deferred compensation, defined benefit pension, retiree or post-termination health or welfare benefits other than COBRA, severance,
retention, change in control compensation, long-term bonus or incentive (longer than a year), or equity or equity-based plans or arrangements (the
“Excluded Benefits”)) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect for (or available to) the Continuing Employees (as a group)
under the employee plans as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the 12 month period following the Effective Time, Parent agreed
to cause the surviving corporation and its respective subsidiaries to provide severance benefits or compensation to certain eligible employees in the
event of a qualifying termination in accordance with certain specified pre-existing employee benefit plans or agreements.
 
-85-Table of Contents
With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement that is made available to any Continuing Employee
at or after the Effective Time, other than any such plans or programs providing for Excluded Benefits (each such plans, a “New Plan”), the surviving
corporation and its subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to, cause to be granted to such Continuing
Employee credit for all service with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and (for
vacation and severance benefits only) entitlement to benefits to the same extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited under the
analogous employee plan prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits for the same period of
service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will or will cause
the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage
pursuant to a corresponding employee plan (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing group medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, or vision benefits, all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or
similar requirements of such New Plan be waived for the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents to the extent such conditions were
inapplicable, met or waived under the comparable employee plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time;
and (iii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits, any eligible expenses incurred by the Continuing
Employees and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that Continuing Employees’ participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins, if such participation begins in the year in which the Effective Time occurs, to be given full credit pursuant to such
New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employees and
their covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off
accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the
Effective Time, and will otherwise be subject to the terms of such vacation and/or paid time off policies as determined by Parent and its affiliates from time
to time (but in no event subject to forfeiture).
With respect to each of the Company’s annual cash incentive plans (each, a “Company Incentive Plan”), for the fiscal year in which the Effective
Time occurs, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) pay to each
Continuing Employee who remains employed with Parent, the surviving corporation or their respective subsidiaries through the applicable payment date,
at the same time or times that Parent, the surviving corporation or their applicable subsidiary pays annual bonuses in respect of such fiscal year to other
similarly situated employees thereof, the bonus (the “Annual Bonus”) that such Continuing Employee is entitled to receive under the applicable
Company Incentive Plan based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria for such fiscal year (as determined after giving
appropriate effect to the Merger).
The Merger Agreement provides that the foregoing provisions under this “Employee Benefits Matters” section will not be deemed to: (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the surviving corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries to terminate or
modify the employment of any Continuing Employee; (ii) establish, modify, or amend any employee plan or New Plan or limit or prohibit the right of Parent
or any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries) to modify, amend or terminate any employee
plan or any New Plan; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee (or beneficiary or dependent thereof).

General
Under the DGCL, you have the right to demand appraisal and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your shares of Poshmark common
stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in lieu of the
consideration you would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in Section 262
of the DGCL described herein. These rights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders of record and beneficial owners electing to exercise appraisal
rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is
required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.
This section is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights. The following discussion,
however, is not a complete summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262
of the DGCL that is accessible at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and incorporated
by reference herein. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. The
following discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a Poshmark stockholder
of record or beneficial owners should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Subject to certain exceptions specified in Section 262 of the DGCL and summarized below, holders of record, and beneficial owners, of shares of
Poshmark common stock who: (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such person’s shares to the Company prior to the vote on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (2) have not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights; (3)
continuously are the record holders or beneficial holders, as applicable, of such shares through the Effective Time; and (4) otherwise comply with the
applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) as of the completion of the Merger instead of the Merger Consideration. Any such
Poshmark stockholder of record or beneficial holder awarded “fair value” for the holder’s shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in
cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to receive the Merger Consideration. It is possible that any such “fair value” as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, that which Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners will receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Section 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders as of the record date for notice of the Special Meeting to vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days before the Special Meeting. Either a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL
or information directing stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription
or cost must be included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to the Company’s stockholders of the availability of appraisal
rights in connection with the Merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the applicable statutory provisions
is accessible at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. 
Stockholders of record and beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights or who wish to preserve the right to do so should review the
following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully. Failure to comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and
proper
 
-96-Table of Contents
manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the
Company unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners seeking appraisal.
Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, stockholders of record and beneficial owners who wish to
exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their own legal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the
DGCL. A Poshmark stockholder of record and beneficial owner who loses, waives or otherwise fails to properly exercise his, her, their or its appraisal
rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.
How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights
If you are a Poshmark stockholder of record of a beneficial holder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of Poshmark
common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:
 
•
You must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. This
written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of
the Merger Agreement. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand
for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder of
record or beneficial holder and the intention of such holder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A failure by such holder to make a
written demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights;
 
•
In the case of a stockholder of record, you must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A vote
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, by proxy submitted by mail, over the Internet or by telephone, will constitute a waiver of
your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A proxy which
does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Therefore, a
stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must instruct the proxy to vote against the adoption of the
Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. In the case of a beneficial owner, you must not
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your share(s), or abstain from voting, in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement;
 
•
You must continuously hold or beneficially own, as applicable, shares of Poshmark common stock from the date of making the demand
through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer the shares before the Effective Time; and
 
•
You must otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, including the requirement that you, another stockholder who
has complied with the requirements of Section 262 or the Company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a
determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Company is under no obligation to file any petition
and has no present intention of doing so.
If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, but you
will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Poshmark common stock.
In addition, because Poshmark’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange and is expected to continue to be listed on such
exchange immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of
Poshmark common stock, unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Poshmark common stock
eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million.
We refer to conditions (1) and (2) as the “ownership thresholds.” At least
 
-97-
Table of Contents
one of the ownership thresholds must be met in order for Company stockholders to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of Poshmark
common stock.
In the case of a record holder of shares of Company common stock, voting, via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy, against,
abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by
Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote. If you want to exercise your appraisal
rights, you must not vote your shares via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
In the case of a beneficial owner of Company common stock, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common stock in “street name”
for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote those shares on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement without
specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if
the beneficial owner provides such instructions. If a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in “street name” instructs such person’s
broker, bank or other nominee to vote such person’s shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, and does not revoke
such instruction prior to the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, then such shares will be voted in favor of the approval
and adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of such beneficial owner’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously
delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, if you are a beneficial owner of Company common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, you
must either not provide any instructions to such person’s broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement or must instruct such broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from
voting on such proposal.
Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights
A holder of record or beneficial owner of shares of Poshmark common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time may
assert appraisal rights for the shares of Poshmark common stock held of record or beneficially in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must be
executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record or beneficial owner, as applicable, and must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the
stockholder of record or beneficial owner and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its common stock. In addition, in the case of
a demand for appraisal made by a beneficial owner, the demand must (1) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is
made, (2) provide documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and
correct copy of what it purports to be and (3) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and
to be set forth on the verified list of persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares pursuant to Section 262(f) of the DGCL. A holder of record,
such as a bank, broker or other nominee, who holds shares of Poshmark common stock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may exercise his, her or its
right of appraisal with respect to the shares of Poshmark common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other
beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Poshmark common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where
no number of shares of Poshmark common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Poshmark common stock
held in the name of the holder of record.
If the shares are owned of record or beneficially owned in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such
demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner or beneficial owner, and if you own shares of Poshmark common stock jointly with one or
more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent
must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder
or holders of record.

Attention: General Counsel and Corporate Secretary
Surviving Corporation’s Actions After Completion of the Merger
If the Merger is consummated, the surviving corporation will give written notice of the Effective Time within ten days after the Effective Time to
Poshmark stockholders of record or beneficial owners who did not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who made a written
demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Company stockholder of
record or beneficial owner that made a demand for appraisal but did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such a proceeding as a named party
will have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares of
Poshmark common stock, but after such 60-day period a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written approval of the surviving
corporation. In addition, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder of record or beneficial owner
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, which approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just;
provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any Poshmark stockholder of record or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal
demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. Within 120 days after the
Effective Time, either a record holder or a beneficial owner of Poshmark common stock, provided such person has complied with the requirements of
Section 262 of the DGCL and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the surviving corporation must commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or
beneficial owner, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of Poshmark common stock held by all stockholders of record and beneficial owners
who have properly demanded appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file an appraisal petition and has no present intention of
doing so. If you desire to have your shares appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the
time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder of record or beneficial owner who has complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of
Poshmark common stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Poshmark has received demands for
appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The surviving corporation must give this statement to you within the later of (1) ten days
after receipt by the surviving corporation of the request therefor or (2) ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you
are the beneficial owner of shares of Poshmark common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or intermediary on your behalf, you may, in your own
name, file an appraisal petition or request from the surviving corporation the statement described in this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record or beneficial owner of Poshmark common stock who has properly exercised
his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving
corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware
Court of Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with
whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
 
-99-
Table of Contents
reached by the surviving corporation. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which stockholders of record and beneficial owners are
entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders of record and beneficial owners demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares to submit
their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of
Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. The Delaware Court of Chancery will also dismiss
proceedings as to all Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met. Where
proceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of
Poshmark common stock owned by such stockholders of record and beneficial owners, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the shares of
Poshmark common stock at the Effective Time held by all Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners who have properly perfected appraisal
rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the
judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any
point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder of record
and beneficial owner entitled to appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the
DGCL, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary
cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest accrued on the amount of the voluntary
cash payment before such payment was made, unless such interest was paid at the time the voluntary cash payment is made. When the value is
determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, less any amounts already paid in a voluntary cash payment, with
interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders of Poshmark of record and beneficial owners entitled to receive the same.
In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value
by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.”
The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which were known, or which could be ascertained as of the date of the
Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated
that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative
elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to
mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not
the product of speculation, may be considered.”
You should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Poshmark common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more
than, the same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement and that an opinion of an investment
banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner
address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.

Table of Contents
Moreover, neither Poshmark nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Poshmark stockholder exercising appraisal
rights and reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Poshmark common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. No
representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in
respect of such shares, then all Poshmark stockholders of record and beneficial owners will lose the right to an appraisal and will instead receive the
Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate those costs to the parties as the Delaware
Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances. Each Poshmark stockholder of record and beneficial owner party to the appraisal
proceeding is responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and expert witnesses’ fees and expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder of record and beneficial owner in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
shares of Poshmark common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a
reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.
If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after the Effective Time, vote the shares
subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to
holders of record of Poshmark common stock as of a record date prior to the Effective Time.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw a demand for appraisal and
accept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration to the
surviving corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the surviving
corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder of record or beneficial owner without
the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided,
however, that this provision will not affect the right of any Poshmark stockholder of record or beneficial owner that has made an appraisal demand but
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to
accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw
your demand for appraisal, waiver or otherwise lose the appraisal right, your shares of Poshmark common stock will be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In that
event, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your shares of Poshmark common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement
without interest. In view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a Poshmark stockholder of record or beneficial owner
and are considering exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and financial advisor.
The process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with the prerequisites of Section 262 of the DGCL. If you wish to
exercise your appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your own legal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of
the DGCL. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL will govern.

If the Merger is completed, we do not expect to hold a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, as Poshmark will cease to be an independent public
company and will become an indirect subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is not completed, you will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in the
Company’s annual meetings of stockholders, and we will hold a 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, in which case we will provide notice of or otherwise
publicly disclose the date on which the 2023 annual meeting will be held. If the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders is held, stockholder proposals will be

Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such Company Common Stock held by any such holder (the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be

(i) Vested Company RSUs. Each Vested Company RSU shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Price and (B) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
“Vested RSU Consideration” and together with the Vested Option Consideration, the “Vested Equity Award Consideration”); provided,
that to the extent any such amount relates to a Vested Company RSU that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of
the Code, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts, without interest and subject to applicable withholding Taxes, at the earliest
time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Vested Company RSU that shall not trigger
a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
(ii) Unvested Company RSUs. Except as set forth in Section 2.8(b)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, each Company RSU outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a Vested Company RSU (an “Unvested Company RSU”) shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the
product of (i) the Per Share Price and (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company RSU as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts”), which Cash Replacement Company RSU
Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries)
through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU for which such Cash
Replacement Company RSU Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any terms providing for acceleration of vesting pursuant to any Employee Plan as in effect on the date hereof). All Cash
Replacement Company RSU Amounts will have the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as applied to the
Unvested Company RSU for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Transactions or for such
other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the
administration of the Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts.
(c) Payment Procedures. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that
is no less than five Business Days after the Closing Date, the holders of Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs (the “Equity Award
Holders”) will be paid by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider, all amounts required to be paid to
such holders in respect of Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs that are cancelled and converted pursuant to this Section 2.8, less any
required withholding pursuant to Section 2.12.

under the Company ESPP in effect as of the date hereof, no offering period under the Company ESPP will be authorized or commenced after the date
hereof; (ii) no new participants will commence participation in the Company ESPP after the date hereof; (iii) no Company ESPP participant will be permitted
to increase such participant’s payroll deduction election or contribution rate in effect as of the date hereof or to make separate non-payroll contributions

date hereof shall be exercised as of no later than three Business Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs (the “Final Exercise Date”); (v)
each Company ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date; and (vi) the Company ESPP will terminate effective as of (and subject to the
occurrence of) immediately prior to the Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights on the Final Exercise Date (in accordance with
the terms of the Company ESPP, including as may be amended to comply with the terms of this provision). All shares of Company Common Stock
purchased on the Final Exercise Date shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Price in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. At the Effective Time, any funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP that are not used to
purchase shares on the Final Exercise Date within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each participant under the Company ESPP
shall be refunded to the applicable participant in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP.
(e) Further Actions. The Company shall take all action necessary to effect the cancellation and conversion of Company Options and
Unvested Company RSUs and to effectuate the treatment of the Company ESPP upon the Effective Time and otherwise to give effect to this Section 2.8
(including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act).
2.9 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall or shall cause Proton Parent to (i) select a nationally recognized bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Payment Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall or shall cause Proton Parent to deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7,
an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7;
provided, that the Company shall, at the written request of Parent, deposit with the Payment Agent at the Closing such portion of such aggregate
consideration from the cash denominated in United States dollars and held in United States bank accounts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
specified in such request (for the avoidance of doubt, the Company will not be required to repatriate any cash or incur any Taxes, costs or expenses in
connection with this Section 2.9(b)); provided further, for the avoidance of doubt, that the foregoing shall not limit in any respect Parent’s obligation to
fund the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to this Article II at the Closing by the Company, Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub. Until disbursed
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent, Proton Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly
available) (such cash and any
 
A-22
Table of Contents
proceeds thereon, the “Payment Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund; (B) the
Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7;
or (C) all or any portion of the Payment Fund is unavailable for Parent or Proton Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent or Proton Parent) to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent or Proton Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times fully available for distribution
and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the
Payment Fund will be payable to Parent, Proton Parent or the Surviving Corporation as Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than the payment to holders of Company Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.7.
(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days), Parent (or Proton Parent) and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares, as applicable) of one or more certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares, as applicable) (the
“Certificates” (if any)) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Per Share Price payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to Section 2.7.
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates by (y) the Per Share
Price, and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no record holder of
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.7 with respect of such Uncertificated Shares. In lieu thereof, such record holder, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request), will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s
transferred Uncertificated Shares by (2) the Per Share Price, and the transferred Uncertificated Shares will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and transfer
of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent (or Proton Parent) and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the
Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that the Payment Agent shall transmit to DTC or its nominee on the
Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(ii) the Per Share Price.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If payment of the Per Share Price is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Share in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person
requesting such exchange present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment
 
A-23
Table of Contents
shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either
has been paid or is not applicable.
(f) No Liability. Subject to applicable Law, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, Proton Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Person will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(g) Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent or Proton Parent. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent (or Proton Parent or the Surviving
Corporation as directed by Parent) upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (or Proton Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
which a portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares was delivered) (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares five years after the Effective
Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.
2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange
procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in
exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.7. Parent, Proton Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price,
require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, Proton Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.
2.12 Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Proton Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation (without duplication)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Options and Company RSUs such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Law in
respect of Taxes. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid in
satisfaction of the corresponding obligations hereunder.

properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement true, correct and complete
copies of the Company’s Organizational Documents, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so disclosed is in full force and effect.

date hereof, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Price to be paid to
the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to
such holders. As of the date of this Agreement, the foregoing opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified in any respect.

obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict with any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (d) will not
result in the creation of any lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the
case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or liens that would not reasonably be

of such amended or superseding filing or furnishing), in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the case may be, each as in effect on the date that such Company SEC Document was filed or furnished, and did not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the

Table of Contents
Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and will not waive, terminate or
modify, any provision of any standstill or similar provision that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Company or Company
Board (or any committee thereof) unless the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action for the purpose of permitting a Person to make a private Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(b) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Company’s receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, subject to
compliance with this Section 5.3(b) and Sections 5.3(c)(ii), 5.3(d) and 5.3(e), the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or

facilitate such Acquisition Proposal or assist such Person (and such Person’s Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal if
requested by such Person, in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) (i) either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) did not result from
a breach of this Section 5.3; provided, that subject to applicable Law and any applicable “clean team” or similar arrangement, the Company shall provide
to Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information, data and/or access that is provided to any Person given such information, data
and/or access that was not previously made available to Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub prior to or promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
following the time it is provided to such Person.
(c) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Company’s receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval:
(i) the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (described in clauses (A), (B) or (D) of the definition
thereof, as applicable) in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, that the Company Board shall not effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change unless:
(A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five Business Days in advance to the effect that the
Company Board intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify the basis for such Company
Board Recommendation Change;
(B) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, during such five Business Day period, has been available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to propose adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would no longer be inconsistent with the
Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and
(C) at the end of the five Business Day period and prior to taking any such action, the Company Board has considered in good
faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the terms of this Agreement, and has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial
 
A-47
Table of Contents
advisors and outside legal counsel), that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would continue to be
inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect; or
(ii) if the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3) that the Company
Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior
Proposal, then the Company Board may (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or
(y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.1(h) in order to enter into a definitive
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Company Board shall not take any action
described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) unless:
(A) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that
the failure to do so is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
(B) (I) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent five Business Days in advance (such notice period, including
any extension thereto in accordance with this Section 5.3(c)(ii)(B), the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board intends
to take the actions described in clauses (x) or (y) of Section 5.3(c)(ii), as applicable, including the identity of the Person or Group
making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions thereof and copies of all agreements, term sheets, financing
commitments and any other documents or written communications relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (II) prior to effecting
such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice Period, have
been available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to
enable Parent to propose adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, as applicable, would no longer be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, that in the event of any material modifications to such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that any
change to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification), the Company will be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(c)(ii)(B) with respect to such new written notice, it
being understood that the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will be three Business Days; and
(C) at the end of the five Business Day period and prior to taking any such action, the Company Board has considered in good
faith any such proposals by Parent to make revisions to the terms of this Agreement, and has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that (x) such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would continue to be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable Law if such changes proposed by Parent were to be given effect.
(d) No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except as expressly permitted by
Section 5.3(c) or Section 5.3(f), the Company Board shall not:
(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, or fail to make when required by this Agreement, or resolve or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend, or fail to make when required by this Agreement, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) qualify or modify (or resolve
or publicly propose to qualify or modify) the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent; (C) adopt, approve,
recommend or publicly declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal; (D) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy

publicly disclosed), fail to publicly
 
A-48

recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders prior to the earlier of (I) three Business
Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting and (II) the tenth Business Day following the commencement thereof
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act (or the fifth Business Day following public disclosure of such material modification, as
applicable); or (F) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer, which is covered by
clause (E) above, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five Business Days after Parent so requests in writing
(it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than two occasions per Acquisition
Proposal and one occasion per material modification thereto); provided that if Parent requests in writing such reaffirmation at least seven
Business Days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, by the date that is at least three Business Days prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting (any action described in clauses (A) through (F), a “Company Board Recommendation Change”); provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the factually accurate disclosure by the Company of solely the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal or (2)
the delivery by the Company of any prior written notice expressly contemplated by Section 5.3(c) will, in and of itself, constitute a Company
Board Recommendation Change; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
(e) Notice. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the
Effective Time, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiries, offers, proposals or requests for information that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received
by the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal or such
inquiry, offer, proposal or request; and (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, offer, proposal or
request, including, if applicable, complete copies of any written documentation or materials. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours), of changes to the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or proposals or
offers (including any amendments thereto) and any changes to the status of any related discussions or negotiations.
(f) Certain Disclosures. Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), making a customary “stop-look-and-listen”
communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication) or from making
disclosures to the Company Stockholders required by applicable securities Laws with regard to the Transactions or an Acquisition Proposal; provided,
that any such disclosure that has the effect of withholding, withdrawing, modifying or qualifying in any manner adverse to, or failing to make when
required by this Agreement, the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change and Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.1(f) unless the Company Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such communication without qualification. To the extent permissible under applicable Law, the
Company shall take such actions as it is required to take pursuant to Section 5.3(c) in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change prior
to making any disclosure contemplated by this Section 5.3(f) that would be or would be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change.
(g) Breach by Representatives. The Company agrees that any breach of this Section 5.3 by any of its Representatives (acting on the
Company’s behalf) shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

to give Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
business or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent, Proton Parent Merger Sub and the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their own
business and operations.

of the Code, and which is sponsored, or contributed to, by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (the “401(k) Plan”) and no further contributions
shall be made to the 401(k) Plan and all participant account balances in such plan shall become 100% vested. The Company shall provide to Parent (a)
executed resolutions of the board of directors of the Company authorizing such termination, and (b) executed amendments to the 401(k) Plan which in
Parent’s reasonable judgment are sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code and regulations thereunder, including such
that the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan will be maintained at the time of termination.

and cooperation of Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company) shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary
proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the “Proxy Statement”) relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting; provided that the Company shall
not be in breach of this Section 6.3(a) as a result of any delay in filing the Proxy Statement caused by Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub’s failure to
comply with their obligations pursuant to Section 6.3(c) in any material respect. Subject to Section 5.3, the Company shall include the Company Board

should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an

misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate

Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, and the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, conduct a
“broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof to enable such record date to
be set for the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section 5.3 and unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
shall use its reasonable efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.
(b) Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the
Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting, and at the request of Parent, the Company shall postpone or adjourn, as
applicable, the Company Stockholder Meeting, (i) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval; (ii) if
there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder

Stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company Stockholders at the
Company Stockholder Meeting.
(c) The Company agrees (i) to provide Parent periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if

statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any “anti-takeover” statute or similar statute or regulation
becomes applicable to the Merger, take all actions within their power to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as reasonably
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement (as applicable) and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger.
6.6 Access. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, subject to
restrictions or limitations as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, consistent with
applicable Law, during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance request, to the properties, books, records, personnel and other information of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, solely for purposes of furthering the Transactions or integration or transition planning relating thereto, except that the
Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law or Contract requires the
Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information or providing access to such documents or information would violate
or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; (b) access to such documents
or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal privilege applicable to such
documents or information; or (c) such documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand (provided, that this clause (c) shall not limit any Party’s rights to discovery).
In the event that the Company objects to any request submitted pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 6.6 and withholds information on the
basis of clauses (a), (b) or (c) of the preceding sentence, the Company shall promptly inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld and
the Company and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure as promptly as reasonably practicable that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments. Any investigation conducted pursuant to
the access contemplated by this Section 6.6 shall be conducted in a manner that does not (i) unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by officers, employees and
other authorized Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of their normal duties or (ii) create a risk of damage or destruction to any
property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive or subsurface testing or any sampling,
monitoring or analysis of soil, groundwater, building materials, indoor air, or other environmental media.
6.7 Section 16(b) Exemption. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board (or a duly formed committee thereof consisting of
non-employee directors (as such term is defined for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act)) shall take all such actions as may
be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause the Transactions, and any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) (including the disposition, cancellation, or deemed disposition and cancellation of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company
RSUs) in connection with the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company, to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Prior to taking the actions required by this Section
6.7, the Company will provide Parent copies of resolutions or other documentation with respect to such actions and the Company shall give

6.8 Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.
(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent and Proton Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification
agreements (to the extent made available to Parent prior to the date hereof) in effect as of the date hereof between the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (each, together with such Person’s heirs, executors and administrators,
an “Indemnified Person” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent and Proton Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement.
During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.8(a), during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent and Proton Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law (including with respect to advancement of expenses and attorneys’ fees and
advancing such expenses and fees without requiring any preliminary determination of entitlement subject to such individual’s affirmation or undertaking
as contemplated by the DGCL), and any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement shall, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, penalties,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or
indirectly, to (i) the fact that an Indemnified Person is or was prior to the Effective Time a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or such
Subsidiary; (ii) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, prior to the Effective Time in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection
with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan), regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time); and
(iii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken prior to the Effective Time by the Company, Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto, except
that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a good faith
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.8(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
until such claim is fully and finally resolved. Any Indemnified Person shall not settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto, any Legal Proceeding for which he or she has submitted or may submit an indemnification claim pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) without the prior
written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent and Proton Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’
and officers’ liability and similar insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms
(including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.8(c), the Surviving Corporation will
 
A-55
Table of Contents
not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300%
amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. In satisfaction of
the foregoing obligations, prior to the Effective Time the Company may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate
cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent and Proton Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and
effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder. If the Company is unable to obtain
the “tail” policy and Parent, Proton Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance described in this Section 6.8(c) for an annual
cost less than or equal to the Maximum Annual Premium, Parent and Proton Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to instead obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for an aggregate annual premium equal to the Maximum Annual Premium.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, Proton Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, Proton Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns shall assume all of the obligations of Parent,
Proton Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.8.
(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.8 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person. Each of the Indemnified Persons are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons pursuant to
this Section 6.8 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii)
the Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).
(f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and
officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.
6.9 Employee Matters.
(a) Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change of control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of
the Employee Plans set forth in Section 3.18(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.
(b) Employment; Benefits. For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination date of an applicable
Continuing Employee (the “Continuation Period”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee (i) base salary or wage rate and short-term (i.e., annual or shorter) cash
incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective
Time; and (ii) employee benefits (excluding, in each
 
A-56
Table of Contents
case, nonqualified deferred compensation, defined benefit pension, retiree or post-termination health or welfare benefits other than COBRA, severance,
retention, change in control compensation, long-term bonus or incentive (longer than a year), or equity or equity-based plans or arrangements (the
“Excluded Benefits”)) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect for (or available to) the Continuing Employees (as a group)
under the Employee Plans as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance benefits or compensation to eligible employees as set forth in Section 6.9(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.
(c) New Plans. With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement that is made available to any
Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time, other than any such plans or programs providing for Excluded Benefits (each such plans, a “New
Plan”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause to be granted
to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and (for vacation and severance benefits only) entitlement to benefits to the same extent and for the same purpose as such service
was credited under the analogous Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits
for the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that (i) each Continuing
Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such
New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a corresponding Employee Plan (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
group medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits, all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan be waived for the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable, met or waived under the comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time; and (iii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits, any eligible expenses incurred by
the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that Continuing
Employees’ participation in the corresponding New Plan begins, if such participation begins in the year in which the Effective Time occurs, to be given
full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employees and their covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such
Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and will otherwise be subject to the terms of such vacation and/or paid time off policies as determined
by Parent and its Affiliates from time to time (but in no event subject to forfeiture).
(d) Company Incentive Plans. With respect to each of the Company’s annual cash incentive plans as set forth in Section 6.9(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (each, a “Company Incentive Plan”), for the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) pay to each Continuing Employee who remains employed
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries through the applicable payment date, at the same time or times that Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their applicable Subsidiary pays annual bonuses in respect of such fiscal year to other similarly situated employees thereof, but
in no event later than March 15 immediately after the end of such fiscal year, a bonus for such fiscal year (the “Annual Bonus”) that is equal to the
Annual Bonus that such Continuing Employee is entitled to receive under the applicable Company Incentive Plan based on actual level of achievement of
the applicable performance criteria for such fiscal year (as determined after giving appropriate effect to the Transactions).
(e) No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Section 6.9 will not be
deemed to: (i) guarantee employment (or any particular term or condition
 
A-57
Table of Contents
of employment) for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate
or modify the employment of any Continuing Employee; (ii) establish, modify, or amend any Employee Plan or New Plan or limit or prohibit the right of
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to modify, amend or terminate any
Employee Plan or any New Plan; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee (or beneficiary or dependent thereof).

perform their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

exchange or national securities quotation system; provided, that neither Parent nor the Company shall be obligated to engage in such consultation with
respect to communications (including communications directed to such Party’s employees, independent contractors and/or non-employee service
providers, suppliers, customers, partners, vendors or stockholders) that are consistent with public statements previously made in accordance with this
Section 6.11; provided, further, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.11 shall not apply to any release or public statement (a) made or proposed to

efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to

after the Effective Time; and (b) the deregistration of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such

8.1(b) shall not be available to a Party if the issuance of such permanent injunction or other final and non-appealable judgment or order, or statute, rule or
regulation was primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or if such Party shall have failed to comply
with its obligations under Section 6.2;
(c) by either Parent or the Company, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether prior to or after the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder

Merger to be consummated prior to the Termination Date;

of Section 5.3(a) (I) by any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than any director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or
(II) by any other Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall not constitute a Willful and Material Breach of the Company or the Company
Board unless the Company or the Company Board, as applicable, either (x) Willfully and Materially Breaches its obligations to so cause or use reasonable
best efforts to cause, as applicable, or (y) fails to use reasonable best efforts to cause such employee or such Representative to promptly cease any
actions that constitute a failure to comply with the terms of Section 5.3(a) after any director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries becoming
aware of such actions;
(g) by the Company, if Parent, Proton Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform any of its respective representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 7.3(a) or (b), except that if such breach is capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date, the Company will not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) prior to the delivery by the Company to Parent of written notice of such breach, delivered at least

Table of Contents
effect without liability of any Party (or any partner, member, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate or Representative of such Party) to the other
Parties, as applicable, except that this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX will each survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their
respective terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 8.3(e), no termination of this Agreement will relieve any Party from any liability
for fraud or any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement by such Party prior to termination. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this
Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, which rights, obligations and agreements will
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.
8.3 Fees and Expenses.
(a) General. Except as set forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger shall be
paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving

respect to the Merger or the transfer of Company Common Stock pursuant to the consummation of the Merger.

Stockholder Approval has not been obtained or Parent has the right to terminate pursuant to Section 8.1(e)), (y) Section 8.1(d) or (z) Section
8.1(e); (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such termination of this Agreement, any Person shall have
publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal (or an Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known), which Acquisition
Proposal has not been withdrawn publicly without qualification prior to the earlier of (I) five days prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting (as such meeting may have been adjourned or postponed in accordance with this Agreement) and (II) such termination of this
Agreement; and (C) within twelve months following such termination of this Agreement, (I) an Acquisition Transaction is consummated,
(II) the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction or (III) to the extent the
Company has not entered into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction, in the case of an
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer, the Company Board shall have (1) approved or recommended to the Company
Stockholders or (2) otherwise not opposed such Acquisition Proposal, and in the case of this clause (III)(2), such Acquisition Proposal is
subsequently consummated (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be consummated at any time following termination of this Agreement),
then the Company shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) after such entry into a definitive agreement or such
approval or recommendation, in the case of clause (II) or (III)(1), respectively, or consummation, in the case of clause (I) or (III)(2), pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent. For purposes of Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to “20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” (including as used in the
definition of “Acquisition Proposal”) will be deemed to be references to “50%.”
(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f) (or in the event that (A) the Company Board shall have made a
Company Board Recommendation Change and (B) this Agreement is terminated (I) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to (x) Section
8.1(c) (at a time when the Requisite Stockholder Approval has not been obtained or Parent has the right to terminate pursuant to Section
8.1(e)) or (y) Section 8.1(d) or (II) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)), then the Company must promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days) following such termination pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.
 
A-64
Table of Contents
(iii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must prior to or substantially concurrently
with such termination pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent.
(c) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events.
(d) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions,
(ii) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but are liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in
which such amounts are payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful and Material Breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3 or any portion
thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent Parent’s reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) in
connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was
actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (collectively, the “Enforcement Expenses”).
(e) Sole Remedy.
(i) The Parties agree that, except with respect to fraud or Willful and Material Breach, the payment of the Company Termination Fee
(and Enforcement Expenses, as applicable) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub with
respect to this Agreement in the event the Company Termination Fee becomes due and payable pursuant to the terms hereof and is paid,
and, upon such payment of the Company Termination Fee, none of (A) the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates;
and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective Affiliates (collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) will have any further liability or obligation to Parent, Proton Parent or
Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Parent, Proton Parent and
Merger Sub and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 8.3(a), as
applicable). The Company Related Parties are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.3(e)(i).
8.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Proton Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to
authorized action by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, no amendment may be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such
approval.
8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, to the extent legally allowed and
except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
 
A-65
Table of Contents
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, as applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance
by the other Party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein applicable to such Party (it being understood that Parent, Proton Parent and
Merger Sub shall be deemed a single Party solely for purposes of this Section 8.5). Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any failure or delay in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will
not constitute a waiver of such right nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

accordance with this Section 9.2, except that that notice of any change to the address or any of the other details specified in or pursuant to this Section

Agreement, by written notice to the Company, to another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent that is an entity formed under the Laws of
the State of Delaware, in which event all references to Merger Sub or Proton Parent, as the case may be, in this Agreement shall be deemed references to
such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement
shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; provided, that (a) no
assignment shall be permitted if such assignment would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent or materially delay Parent, Proton Parent or Merger
Sub from performing their respective obligations under this Agreement or consummating the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) no assignment shall relieve Parent of any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary but except as provided for in the first sentence of this Section 9.3, no assignment by any Party
will relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment of this Agreement except as provided by this Section 9.3 is null and
void.
9.4 Confidentiality. Parent, Proton Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Proton Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective Representatives shall hold and treat all documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or
made available to Parent, Proton Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with the

Table of Contents
Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the standstill
and similar restrictions in the Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement to the extent required to
permit any action contemplated hereby.
9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred
to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent Disclosure Letter and the Company Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. Subject to Section 9.4, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of this
Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement
expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.
9.6 Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the

for the right of the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company RSUs to receive the Per Share Price and the Vested Equity Award
Consideration, respectively, in each case after the Effective Time, (c) as set forth in or contemplated by Section 8.3(e) and (d) in the event of Parent’s,
Proton Parent’s or Merger Sub’s Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement, then, following the termination of this Agreement, the Company may,
subject to Section 8.3(e), seek damages and other relief (including equitable relief) on behalf of the holders of Company Common Stock, Company
Options and Company RSUs.
9.7 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
9.8 Remedies.
(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein (including Section 8.3(e)), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including Section
9.8(b)), although the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages, under no circumstances will the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including any
monetary damages in lieu of specific performance).
(b) Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing
to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions; (ii) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof; (iii) neither the ability of either Party to recover damages for fraud or any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement nor the
provisions of Section 8.3 are intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or
 
A-68
Table of Contents
Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (iv) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties
agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, Proton Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Naver Corporation (“Naver”) and its affiliates)
of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and Class B common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (“Class B Common Stock” and together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Shares”), of Poshmark, Inc. (the “Company”) of the
$17.90 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 3, 2022
(the “Agreement”), by and among Naver, Proton Parent, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Naver (“Proton Parent”), Proton Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Proton Parent, and the Company.
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its
affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest,
may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit
default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Naver, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Mayfield Fund, L.L.C.
(“Mayfield”), a significant shareholder of the Company, and its affiliates and portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in
the transaction contemplated by the Agreement (the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, the
principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses
arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or
underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive,
compensation, including having acted as underwriter with respect to the initial public offering of 7,590,000 shares of the Company’s Class A Common
Stock in January 2021. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Naver, Mayfield, and their
respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies for which our Investment Banking Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman
Sachs & Co. LLC also may have co-invested with Mayfield and its affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of
affiliates of Mayfield from time to time and may do so in the future.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-
K of the Company for the two years ended December 31, 2021; the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained
therein last amended on January 13, 2021, relating to an initial public offering of the Shares; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for
the Company; certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our use by the Company
(the “Forecasts”); and certain net operating loss projections for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our use by the Company (the
“NOL Projections”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and
current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of
Class A Common Stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the
securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the technology industry; and performed
such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts and the NOL Projections have been reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation
or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the
Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement,
without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This
opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Naver and its affiliates) of Shares as of the date hereof, of the
$17.90 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion
does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by
the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, any allocation of the aggregate consideration payable to the
holders of Shares pursuant to the Agreement, including among the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the fairness of the
Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of
the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of
the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $17.90 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders
(other than Naver and its affiliates) of Shares, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to
the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time or as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company,
Naver or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the

Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Naver or the ability of the Company or Naver to pay their respective obligations when they
come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us
as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events
occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of
Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any
holder of Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman
Sachs & Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $17.90 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than
Naver and its affiliates) of Shares, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
 
Very truly yours,
(GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. LLC)
