Company Stock
At the Effective Time, each then outstanding share of Company Stock (other than (A) shares of Company Stock (i) held by McAfee as treasury
stock, (ii) owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (iii) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of McAfee or Parent (other than Merger
Subsidiary) or (iv) owned by McAfee Stockholders who have properly and validly exercised and not withdrawn their statutory rights of appraisal in
respect of such shares of Company Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the shares in clause (A), collectively, the “Excluded Shares”) and
(B) shares of unvested Company Stock that do not accelerate and become vested in connection with the Merger (referred to in this proxy statement as
“Company Restricted Shares” and as further discussed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Merger Consideration—Treatment of
Company Stock Awards”)) will automatically be canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $26.00,
without interest (the “Per Share Consideration” and the aggregate consideration, the “Merger Consideration”).
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration with a
designated paying agent for payment of each share of Company Stock (other than Excluded Shares and certain Company Restricted Shares converted to
Cash Awards) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a McAfee
Stockholder (except that McAfee Stockholders who properly and validly exercise and do not withdraw their appraisal rights will not be entitled to receive
the Per Share Consideration and instead shall have the right to receive payment for the “fair value” of their shares determined pursuant to an appraisal
proceeding, as contemplated by Delaware law). For more information on appraisal rights, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time:
 
 
•
 Each in-the-money option to purchase Company Stock (referred to in this proxy statement as a “Company Stock Option”) that is
outstanding and vested (including, without limitation, each Company Stock Option that accelerates and becomes vested by its terms in
connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash determined by
multiplying the excess of the Per Share Consideration over the exercise price of the Company Stock Option by the number of shares of
Company Stock subject to such option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each option to purchase Company Stock that is not in-
the-money (whether or not vested) shall be canceled for no consideration.
 
 
•
 Each restricted stock unit (referred to in this proxy statement as a “Company RSU”) and each performance stock unit (referred to in this
proxy statement as a “Company PSU”, and collectively with the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company RSUs,
the “Company Awards”) with respect to Company Stock that is then outstanding and vested (including each Company RSU and each
Company PSU that accelerates and becomes vested by its terms in connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the
right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to the number of shares of Company Stock subject to the vested Company RSU
or Company PSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share Consideration.
 
 
•
 Each Company Award that is then outstanding and not vested (other than options to purchase Company Stock that are not in-the-money)
will be converted into a cash award (referred to in this proxy statement as a “Cash Award”), which will remain subject to the same time-
vesting terms and conditions that apply immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, and will be paid out on the
 
3Table of Contents
 
next payroll date following the applicable vesting date, so long as the applicable portion becomes vested prior to the applicable holder’s
termination of service, and will be subject to vesting, payment, and other conditions that are no less favorable to each such holder than
those that applied to the corresponding Company Award immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. Each Cash Award will
provide the applicable holder with the opportunity to be paid an amount in cash equal to:
 
 
•
 with respect to each Cash Award deriving from an in-the-money Company Stock Option that is not vested, (i) the excess of the Per
Share Consideration over the option exercise price of such in-the-money Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to such in-the-money Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; and
 
 
•
 with respect to each Cash Award deriving from a Company Restricted Share, Company RSU, or Company PSU that is not vested (i)
the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Restricted Share, Company RSU, or Company PSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Consideration; provided, that (A) in the case of a Company PSU
that is not vested and that has an applicable one-year performance period that ends on or ended prior to the Effective Time, for
purposes of determining the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU to be converted into a Cash Award,
such Company PSU shall be deemed earned based on the actual performance of McAfee during such performance period, and (B) in
the case of a Company PSU that is not vested and that has an applicable one-year performance period that ends after the Effective
Time, for purposes of determining the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU to be converted into a Cash
Award, the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU shall be determined as though such performance
conditions were satisfied at the applicable target levels.
Following the execution of the Merger Agreement, McAfee and the purchasing parties have further agreed that, in connection with the closing of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and generally subject to an applicable individual’s continued employment or other service to
McAfee and its affiliates through the time that is immediately prior to the closing (except as described below), the following accelerated vesting terms will
apply effective as of immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the “Special Vesting Opportunity”):
 
 
•
 each individual whose employment or other service to the Company and its affiliates commenced prior to January 1, 2021, will become
vested in an additional number of then-outstanding unvested Company Awards having an aggregate dollar value (determined based on the
amount payable in respect of such outstanding Company Awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement and without regard to vesting
conditions) equal to the excess, if any, of (i) 25% of the combined total dollar value associated with the individual’s then-outstanding
unvested Company Awards (other than any Company Awards granted after the execution of the Merger Agreement) and then-outstanding
unvested Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC (as defined below) over (ii) the total dollar value associated with the individual’s then-
outstanding unvested Company Awards, and then-outstanding unvested Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC, in each case, that will
vest or otherwise accelerate by their terms or the terms of the Merger Agreement in connection with the consummation of the Merger; and
 
 
•
 each individual whose employment or other service to the Company and its affiliates commenced on or after January 1, 2021, but before
November 1, 2021, will become vested in an additional number of then-outstanding unvested Company Awards having an aggregate dollar
value (determined based on the amount payable in respect of such outstanding Company Awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement and
without regard to vesting conditions) equal to the excess, if any, of (i) 12.5% of the combined total dollar value associated with the
individual’s then outstanding-unvested Company Awards (other than any Company Awards granted after the execution of the Merger
Agreement) over (ii) the total value associated with such individual’s then-outstanding unvested Company Awards that will otherwise
accelerate by their terms or the terms of the Merger Agreement in connection with the consummation of the Merger.

•
 The Special Vesting Opportunity will not apply with respect to any employee or other service provider that remains employed by, or is
providing services to, McAfee or any of its affiliates as of immediately prior to the Closing if, as of the time of the Closing, the service
provider’s employment or other service is scheduled to transfer to an affiliate of the buyer of McAfee’s Enterprise business unit (i.e.,
because of a delayed transfer of subsidiaries in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions) pursuant to the divestiture transaction that closed on July 27,
2021. To the extent that any Company Awards vest pursuant to the Special Vesting Opportunity, (i) the dollar value of the applicable award
holder’s Cash Awards received in exchange for Company Awards, that do not vest in connection with the Closing will be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the dollar value of the Special Vesting Opportunity, with the offset being applied in reverse chronological order
(i.e., starting with the amount payable on the latest vesting date after the consummation of the Merger (the “Closing Date”) and, to the
extent necessary, proceeding to the next latest vesting date, etc.), (ii) such vesting will be deemed to take place immediately prior to the
Closing for all purposes of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) such Company Awards so impacted by the Special Vesting Opportunity will
become vested pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement as of immediately prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Company Awards will vest and accelerate with respect to the Special Vesting Opportunity if the holder would have already become vested
as of the Closing in respect of at least 25% or 12.5%, as applicable, of the combined total dollar value of his or her then-outstanding
unvested Company Awards (other than any Company Awards granted after the execution of the Merger Agreement) and then-outstanding
unvested Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC pursuant to the terms thereof or the terms of the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contemplates that McAfee may request Parent’s consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) to the vesting of Company Awards held by current or former employees and service providers prior to the Effective Time that would
otherwise not vest in accordance with their terms or the Special Vesting Opportunity described above.

The Board of Directors of McAfee (the “Board of Directors”) shall take all actions so that all Management Incentive Units of Foundation
Technology Worldwide LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“OpCo LLC”), shall be vested in full as of immediately prior to the Exchange and
Redemption (as defined below) and (i) McAfee will require each holder of vested Management Incentive Units and each holder of Class A Units of OpCo
LLC to effect an exchange of all such holder’s vested Management Incentive Units for New Class A Units (as defined in the Second Amended and
Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of OpCo LLC dated as of October 21, 2020 (the “OpCo LLC Agreement”)) of OpCo LLC, and, thereafter,
will require each holder to effect a redemption of all of such Class A Units of OpCo LLC (including New Class A Units, if applicable) and shares of Class B
Common Stock, in exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Exchange and Redemption”) and (ii) each share of Class B Common Stock, if any,
will automatically be cancelled immediately upon the consummation of the Exchange and Redemption, such that no shares of Class B Common Stock
remain outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

The receipt of cash by McAfee Stockholders in exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock in the Merger will be a taxable transaction to
McAfee Stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by each McAfee Stockholder that is a U.S. Holder (as defined under the
section, “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
in the shares of Class A Common Stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such McAfee Stockholder. Backup withholding taxes
 
5Table of Contents
may also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the Merger, unless such U.S. Holder complies with certification procedures under the backup
withholding rules.
A McAfee Stockholder that is a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section, “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Class A Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless
such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies
with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
McAfee Stockholders should read the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger.”
McAfee Stockholders should consult their tax advisors in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal,
state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax consequences relating to the Merger.
Appraisal Rights",14,15
McAfee Corp._20220104_DEFM14A_19754815_4361365.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, McAfee Stockholders who continuously hold shares of Company Stock through the
Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly and validly demand appraisal of their shares, and who
do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the
Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that McAfee Stockholders may be entitled to have their shares of Company Stock appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Company Stock, exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as
determined by the court (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal
Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each
McAfee Stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process,
McAfee Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights.
McAfee Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did
not seek appraisal of their shares of Company Stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, McAfee Stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to McAfee before the vote is taken on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue
to hold shares of Company Stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights
under the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of McAfee unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the McAfee
Stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which is
qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is
reproduced in Annex E to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Company Stock through a bank, broker or other

for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights.”

The obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition. We anticipate that the total

the Merger by Parent and Merger Subsidiary under the Merger Agreement, will be approximately $14 billion. This amount includes funds needed to: (1)
pay McAfee Stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement for their Company Stock (other than Excluded Shares and certain Company
Restricted Shares that are converted into Cash Awards), (2) make payments in respect of our outstanding and vested Company Awards payable in

and in the best interests of McAfee and the McAfee Stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and any other agreement
executed and delivered in connection with the Merger Agreement on the date thereof (collectively, the “Transaction Documents”) and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger) and by the Transaction Documents, and (iii) resolved, subject to Section 6.03 of the

Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by McAfee Stockholders, under certain circumstances, the Board of Directors may withdraw or
change the foregoing recommendation if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel), in
response to an Acquisition Proposal or an Intervening Event, the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of
Directors’ fiduciary duties to McAfee Stockholders under Delaware law. However, the Board of Directors cannot withdraw or change the foregoing
recommendation unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith
over a three (3) business day period to amend the Merger Agreement to obviate the need for such change in recommendation, after which the Board of
Directors shall have determined that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation: Adverse Recommendation Change”) would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law. The termination of the Merger Agreement by McAfee or
Parent in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change will result in the payment by McAfee of a termination fee (the “Company Termination
Fee”) of either (i) $145,632,500 if the Merger Agreement is terminated before the Cut-Off Date (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned

McAfee Corp._20220104_DEFM14A_19754815_4361365.Pdf,Amendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement,"Amendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement
Concurrent with the initial public offering of the Class A Common Stock and related reorganization transactions undertaken in connection with
such initial public offering, McAfee, OpCo LLC and certain of their affiliates entered into a tax receivable agreement dated as of October 21, 2020 (the
“TRA”) with (1) certain members of OpCo LLC who retained OpCo LLC units after McAfee’s initial public offering and (2) certain of the affiliates of such
members. The TRA provides for payment by McAfee to such members and certain of their
 
14Table of Contents
affiliates (collectively, the “TRA beneficiaries”) of 85% of the benefits, if any, that McAfee is deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions) as a
result of (i) all or a portion of McAfee’s allocable share of existing tax basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) acquired in connection with
the reorganization transactions undertaken in connection with McAfee’s initial public offering, (ii) increases in McAfee’s allocable share of existing tax
basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) and tax basis adjustments in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) as a result of sales or
exchanges of OpCo LLC units after McAfee’s initial public offering, (iii) certain tax attributes of the corporations McAfee acquired in connection with
such reorganization transactions (including their allocable share of existing tax basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries)), and (iv) certain
other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. The increases in McAfee’s allocable
share of existing tax basis in OpCo LLC assets and tax basis adjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and
amortization deductions available to members of OpCo LLC and, therefore, may reduce the amount of tax that McAfee would otherwise be required to pay
in the future in respect of taxable income and gain allocated to McAfee with respect to OpCo LLC units.
Concurrent with the entry into the TRA on October 21, 2020, the limited liability company operating agreement of OpCo LLC was amended and
restated to be in the form of the OpCo LLC Agreement. The OpCo LLC Agreement contemplates, among other things, the quarterly distribution of cash to
the members of OpCo LLC (which entity is intended to be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) intended to be sufficient to
cover such members’ respective U.S. federal, state and local income tax liability (as determined in accordance with the OpCo LLC Agreement). Such tax
liability relates to the net amount of taxable income and gain allocated to such members for the relevant taxable period (or as a result of any capital shifts
or guaranteed payments for the use of capital) with respect to OpCo LLC units held by such members. These tax distributions result in the outflow of
cash from OpCo LLC to members of the OpCo LLC each quarter.
On November 5, 2021, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, McAfee and OpCo LLC and certain of their affiliates entered into
an amendment to the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement (the “Amendment”) with TPG Global, LLC and Intel Americas, Inc. (in their capacities as the
“TPG Nominee” and the “Intel Nominee” respectively as such terms are defined under the TRA) and certain other TRA beneficiaries and members of
OpCo LLC, in accordance with the terms of the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement. A copy of the Amendment is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Amendment (i) amends the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement (as further described below) and (ii) provides for certain covenants regarding
tax reporting and tax-related actions after the closing of the Merger.
The Amendment provides for (i) the payment of amounts due under the TRA with respect to McAfee’s 2020 U.S. federal income tax year in
accordance with the terms of the TRA up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000, which payments shall be paid no later than 10 business days prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) the suspension of all other payments under the TRA from and after November 5, 2021 and (iii) the amendment of the TRA by inserting a
new Section 7.19 into the TRA effective as of immediately prior to and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time which will result in the TRA
(and all of McAfee’s future obligations thereunder, including the obligation to make any of the foregoing suspended payments) terminating immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The Amendment also includes agreements among the parties thereto regarding the preparation of tax returns for tax periods
that end on, before or include the Closing Date and limits actions that may be taken by McAfee, OpCo LLC and certain of their controlled affiliates after
the closing of the Merger to the extent such actions may have an effect on items reflected on such tax returns.
The Amendment also (i) suspends all tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement from and after November 5, 2021 for so long as the
Amendment is in effect, and (ii) provides that from and after the Effective Time, no person or entity shall have any obligation to make or pay tax
distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement.

Table of Contents
In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Amendment shall become null and void ab initio and all
payments that were suspended under the TRA pursuant to the Amendment, and all tax distributions that were suspended under the OpCo LLC
Agreement pursuant to the Amendment, shall be made by McAfee and OpCo LLC as if the Amendment had never been executed.
The Amendment will result in (i) the suspension of certain in payments under the TRA with respect to McAfee’s 2021 U.S. federal income tax year
in aggregate and (ii) contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement, a permanent elimination of certain payments
under the TRA that would have otherwise been payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA with respect to McAfee’s 2021 U.S. federal income tax
year. The Amendment will also eliminate any obligation of McAfee to make a payment under the TRA as a result of a change of control of McAfee, which
would be substantial. The Amendment also will result in (i) the suspension of certain tax distributions by OpCo LLC under the OpCo LLC Agreement with
respect to McAfee’s 2021 and 2022 U.S. federal income tax years and (ii) contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time under the Merger
Agreement, a permanent elimination of an obligation to make such tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement.

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A: McAfee Stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. Each holder of
Company Stock on the Record Date shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each share of
Company Stock owned by such holder at the close of business on the Record Date.
Q: May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A: Yes. If you are a McAfee Stockholder of record, you may attend the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website on
February 9, 2022 and complete a virtual ballot, whether or not you sign and return your proxy card. If you are a McAfee Stockholder of record, you will
need your assigned 16-digit control number to vote shares electronically at the Special Meeting. The control number can be found on the proxy card,
voting instruction form, or other applicable proxy notices.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Special Meeting, we encourage you
to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). If you attend the Special Meeting and complete a virtual ballot, your vote will
revoke any proxy previously submitted.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the
voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals,
including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote your
shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q: As a McAfee Stockholder, what will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Consideration of $26.00 in cash, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Company Stock that you own (other than certain Company Restricted Shares), unless you have properly
and validly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of Class A Common Stock, you will
receive $2,600 in cash in exchange for your shares of Class A Common Stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q: What will I receive for my Company Awards, Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC, and Class A Units of OpCo LLC in the Merger?
A: Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time:  
 
 
•
 Each in-the-money Company Stock Option that is outstanding and vested (including, without limitation, each Company Stock Option that
accelerates and becomes vested by its terms in connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive,
without interest, an amount in cash determined by multiplying the excess of the Per Share Consideration over the exercise price of the
Company Stock Option by the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 
 
•
 Each Company RSU and Company PSU that is then outstanding and vested as of the Effective Time (including each Company RSU and
Company PSU that accelerates and becomes vested by its terms in connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the
right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to the number of shares of Company Stock subject to the vested Company RSU
or Company PSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share Consideration.
 
 
•
 Each Management Incentive Unit of OpCo LLC that is outstanding and unvested will become vested in full. In respect of each share of
Company Stock received in connection with the Exchange and Redemption of vested Management Incentive Units and Class A Units of
OpCo LLC, the holder will receive the same Per Share Consideration payable to other holders of Company Stock (other than Excluded
Shares and certain Company Restricted Shares).
 
 
•
 Each Company Award that is then outstanding and not vested (other than options to purchase Company Stock that are not in-the-money)
will be converted into a Cash Award, which will remain subject to the same time-vesting terms and conditions that apply immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and will be paid out on the next payroll date following the applicable vesting date, so long as the applicable portion
becomes vested prior to the applicable holder’s termination of service. Each Cash Award will be subject to vesting, payment, and other
conditions that are no less favorable to each such holder than those that applied to the corresponding Company Award immediately prior to
the consummation of the Merger. Each Cash Award will provide each applicable holder with the opportunity to be paid an amount in cash
equal to:
 
 
•
 
with respect to Cash Awards deriving from an in-the-money Company Stock Option that is not vested, (i) the excess of the
Per Share Consideration over the option exercise price of such in-the-money Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of
 
18
Table of Contents
 
Company Stock subject to such in-the-money Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; and
 
 
•
 
with respect to Cash Awards deriving from a Company Restricted Share, Company RSU or Company PSU that is not vested
(i) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Restricted Share, Company RSU or Company PSU as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Consideration; provided, that (A) in the case of a
Company PSU that is not vested and that has an applicable one-year performance period that ends on or ended prior to the
Effective Time, for purposes of determining the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU
converted into a Cash Award, such Company PSU shall be deemed earned based on the actual performance of McAfee
during such performance period, and (B) in the case of a Company PSU that is not vested and that has an applicable one-
year performance period that ends after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining the number of shares of Company
Stock subject to such Company PSU converted into a Cash Award, the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Company PSU shall be determined as though such performance conditions were satisfied at the applicable target levels.
 
 
•
 In addition, following the execution of the Merger Agreement, McAfee and the other parties to the Merger Agreement further agreed that,
in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, generally subject to an applicable individual’s
continued employment or other service to McAfee and its affiliates through the time that is immediately prior to the closing (except as
described below), the following Special Vesting Opportunity will apply effective as of immediately prior to the closing:
 
 
•
 each individual whose employment or other service to the Company and its affiliates commenced prior to January 1, 2021, will become
vested in an additional number of then-outstanding unvested Company Awards having an aggregate dollar value (determined based
on the amount payable in respect of such outstanding Company Awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement and without regard to
vesting conditions) equal to the excess, if any, of (i) 25% of the combined total dollar value associated with the individual’s then-
outstanding unvested Company Awards (other than any Company Awards granted after the execution of the Merger Agreement) and
then-outstanding unvested Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC (as defined below) over (ii) the total dollar value associated
with the individual’s then-outstanding unvested Company Awards, and then-outstanding unvested Management Incentive Units of
OpCo LLC, in each case, that will vest or otherwise accelerate by their terms or the terms of the Merger Agreement in connection with
the consummation of the Merger; and
 
 
•
 each individual whose employment or other service to the Company and its affiliates commenced on or after January 1, 2021, but
before November 1, 2021, will become vested in an additional number of then-outstanding unvested Company Awards having an
aggregate dollar value (determined based on the amount payable in respect of such outstanding Company Awards pursuant to the
Merger Agreement and without regard to vesting conditions) equal to the excess, if any, of (i) 12.5% of the combined total dollar
value associated with the individual’s then outstanding-unvested Company Awards (other than any Company Awards granted after
the execution of the Merger Agreement) over (ii) the total value associated with such individual’s then-outstanding unvested
Company Awards that will otherwise accelerate by their terms or the terms of the Merger Agreement in connection with the
consummation of the Merger.
 
 
•
 The Special Vesting Opportunity will not apply with respect to any employee or other service provider that remains employed by, or is
providing services to, McAfee or any of its affiliates as of immediately prior to the Closing if, as of the time of the Closing, the service
provider’s employment or other service is scheduled to transfer to an affiliate of the buyer of McAfee’s Enterprise business unit (i.e.,
because of a delayed transfer of subsidiaries in certain non-U.S.
 
19
Table of Contents
 
jurisdictions) pursuant to the divestiture transaction that closed on July 27, 2021. To the extent that any Company Awards vest
pursuant to the Special Vesting Opportunity, (i) the dollar value of the applicable award holder’s Cash Awards received in exchange
for Company Awards, that do not vest in connection with the Closing will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the dollar value
of the Special Vesting Opportunity, with the offset being applied in reverse chronological order (i.e., starting with the amount payable
on the latest vesting date after the consummation of the Merger (the “Closing Date”) and, to the extent necessary, proceeding to the
next latest vesting date, etc.), (ii) such vesting will be deemed to take place immediately prior to the Closing for all purposes of the
Merger Agreement, and (iii) such Company Awards so impacted by the Special Vesting Opportunity will become vested pursuant to
the terms of the Merger Agreement as of immediately prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, no Company Awards will vest
and accelerate with respect to the Special Vesting Opportunity if the holder would have already become vested as of the Closing in
respect of at least 25% or 12.5%, as applicable, of the combined total dollar value of his or her then-outstanding unvested Company
Awards (other than any Company Awards granted after the execution of the Merger Agreement) and then-outstanding unvested
Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC pursuant to the terms thereof or the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Q: What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any McAfee Stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy
over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card); or (iii) vote in person by virtual ballot at the Special
Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a
quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card
but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1)
“FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on a non-binding advisory basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the
adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 
Q: Have any McAfee Stockholders already agreed to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement? 
A: Yes. TPG VII Manta AIV I, L.P., TPG VII Manta Finance I, L.P., TPG VII Manta Blocker Co-Invest I, L.P., TPG VII Side-by-Side Separate Account I,
L.P., TPG VII Manta Holdings II, L.P., TPG VII Manta AIV Co-Invest, L.P., and Intel Americas, Inc., which collectively own 65,591,599 shares of Class A
Common Stock and 227,349,460 shares of Class B Common Stock representing approximately 35.86% of the total outstanding Class A Common Stock and
89.40% of the total outstanding Class B Common Stock, respectively, or approximately 67.91% of the total voting power of the Company Stock as of
December 14, 2021, have entered into the Voting Agreement with Parent. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, the foregoing entities have agreed, among
other things, to vote their shares of Company Stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and against any competing transaction so
long as the Merger Agreement has not been terminated and
 
20
Table of Contents
the Board of Directors has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Voting Agreement.”
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by McAfee Stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, McAfee Stockholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of Company Stock. Instead, McAfee will remain an independent public company, the Class A Common Stock
will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, (a) McAfee will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of either $145,632,500 or $291,265,000, or (b) Parent will
be required to pay McAfee a termination fee of $582,530,000, in each case, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fee.”
Q: Why are McAfee Stockholders being asked to cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the Compensation Proposal? 
A: The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require McAfee to seek a non-binding advisory vote with respect to certain payments
that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q: What vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal?
A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to
vote on the subject matter is required for approval of the Compensation Proposal.
Q: What will happen if McAfee Stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting? 
A: Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation
Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on McAfee. Therefore, if the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is
completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to McAfee’s named executive officers in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
Q: What do I need to do now?
A: You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the
Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other
things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card), so that your
shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q: Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
A: No. After the Merger is completed, the paying agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and written instructions that explain
how to exchange shares of Company Stock represented by such holder’s book-entry shares for the Per Share Consideration.

Table of Contents
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Company Stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting? 
A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If
you sell or transfer your shares of Company Stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision
of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies McAfee in writing of such
special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or
transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of
Company Stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant
your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a McAfee Stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), you are
considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly
to you by McAfee.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of Company Stock held in
“street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to
those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your
shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of
record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q: How may I vote?
A: If you are a McAfee Stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Company Stock are registered in your name with AST, our transfer agent),
there are four (4) ways to vote:
 
 
•
 by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
 
 
•
 by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
 
 
•
 by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card; or
 
 
•
 by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Company Stock, and to
confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions
provided in the enclosed proxy card). Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet
by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each case, you may incur costs such as
Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of Company Stock by proxy. If you are a
record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Company Stock in person by
virtual ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote in person by virtual
ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
 
22
Table of Contents
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you
should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.
Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special
Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against adoption of the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the adjournment proposal.
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A: Yes. If you are a McAfee Stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special
Meeting by:
 
 
•
 signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
 
 
•
 submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 
 
•
 delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of McAfee; or
 
 
•
 by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.
If you hold your shares of Company Stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how
to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q: What is a proxy?
A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Company Stock. The written document describing the matters to be
considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Company
Stock is called a “proxy card.” Peter Leav, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is the proxy holder for the Special Meeting, with full power of
substitution and re-substitution. 
Q: If a McAfee Stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the
way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for
or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on a non-binding advisory basis, the
Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Table of Contents
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one (1) set of voting materials?
A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed
proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one (1) set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one (1) brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for
each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a McAfee Stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one (1) name,
you will receive more than one (1) proxy card.
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A: McAfee intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All
reports that McAfee files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the first half of 2022.
However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the
Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q: Who can help answer my questions?
A: If you have any questions concerning the Merger, the Special Meeting or the accompanying proxy statement, would like additional copies of the
accompanying proxy statement or need help voting your shares of Company Stock, please contact our proxy solicitor:

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.
If a McAfee Stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the McAfee Stockholder voted “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and “AGAINST” the proposal to
 
26Table of Contents
approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the Compensation Proposal. For McAfee Stockholders who attend the Special Meeting or are represented by
proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the McAfee Stockholder voted “AGAINST” any proposal to adjourn the
Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return
a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal
because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of
relevant shares. McAfee does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees
only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the
Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Company Stock at the Special Meeting without
receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares of Company Stock will have the same effect as a vote “against” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

As of December 25, 2021, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 607,462 shares of Class
A Common Stock and 356,100 shares of Class B Common Stock, representing approximately 0.22% of the shares of Company Stock outstanding on

If the Merger is consummated, McAfee Stockholders who continuously hold shares of Company Stock through the Effective Time, who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares, and who do not withdraw their demands or
otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.
This means that holders of shares of Company Stock who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and
who follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Company Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—
Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger
to each McAfee Stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal
process, McAfee Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the
advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
McAfee Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they
did not seek appraisal of their shares.
 
29Table of Contents
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to McAfee before the vote is taken on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold your shares of
Company Stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In
addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are
satisfied by the McAfee Stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant
section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced and attached as Annex E to this proxy statement and
incorporated herein by reference. If you hold your shares of Company Stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise

for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee.

becomes vested by its terms in connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive, without interest, an
amount in cash determined by multiplying the excess of the Per Share Consideration over the exercise price of the Company Stock Option
by the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each option to purchase
Company Stock that is not in-the-money (whether or not vested) shall be canceled for no consideration.
 
 
•
 Each Company RSU and Company PSU that is outstanding and vested as of the Effective Time (including each Company RSU and each
Company PSU that accelerates and becomes vested by its terms in connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the
right to receive, without
 
33Table of Contents
 
interest, an amount in cash equal to the number of shares of Company Stock subject to the vested Company RSU or Company PSU award
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share Consideration.
 
 
•

jurisdictions, and each right to receive previously accrued but not yet paid cash dividends or distributions in respect of Company Awards,
 
jurisdictions, and each right to receive previously accrued but not yet paid cash dividends or distributions in respect of Company Awards,
Class A Units of OpCo LLC, or Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC (collectively, “Company Cash Rights”) will be assumed, honored,
or continued in accordance with its terms.
 
 
•
 Each Company Award that is then outstanding and not vested (other than options to purchase Company Stock that are not in-the-money)
will be converted into a Cash Award, which will remain subject to the same time-vesting terms and conditions that apply immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and will be paid out on the next payroll date following the applicable vesting date, so long as the applicable portion
becomes vested prior to the applicable holder’s termination of service. Each Cash Award will be subject to vesting, payment, and other
conditions that are no less favorable to each such holder than those that applied to the corresponding Company Award immediately prior to

equal to:

Share Consideration over the option exercise price of such in-the-money Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to such in-the-money Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the closing; and
 
 
•

the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Restricted Share, Company RSU, or Company PSU as of
immediately prior to the closing multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Consideration; provided, that (A) in the case of a Company PSU that is
not vested and that has an applicable one-year performance period that ends on or ended prior to the closing, for purposes of

Company PSU shall be deemed earned based on the actual performance of McAfee during such performance period, and (B) in the

purposes of determining the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU to be converted into a Cash Award,
the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU shall be determined as though such performance conditions
were satisfied at the applicable target levels.

The Special Vesting Opportunity will not apply with respect to any employee or other service provider that remains employed by, or is providing
services to, McAfee or any of its affiliates as of immediately prior to the Closing if, as of the time of the Closing, the service provider’s employment or
other service is scheduled to transfer to an affiliate of the buyer of McAfee’s Enterprise business unit (i.e., because of a delayed transfer of subsidiaries
in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions) pursuant to the divestiture transaction that closed on July 27, 2021. To the extent that any Company Awards vest
pursuant to the Special Vesting Opportunity, (i) the dollar value of the applicable award holder’s Cash Awards received in exchange for Company Awards
that do not vest in connection with the Closing Date will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the dollar value of the Special Vesting Opportunity to
such employee or other service provider, with the offset being applied in reverse chronological order (i.e., starting with the amount payable on the latest
vesting date after the Closing Date and, to the extent necessary, proceeding to the next latest vesting date, etc.), (ii) such vesting will be deemed to take
place immediately prior to the Closing for all purposes of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) such Company Awards so impacted by the Special Vesting
Opportunity will become vested pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of immediately prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, no Company
Awards will vest and accelerate with respect to the Special Vesting Opportunity if the holder would have already become vested as of the Closing in
respect of at least 25% or 12.5%, as applicable, of the combined total dollar value of his or her then-outstanding unvested Company Awards (other than
any Company Awards granted after the execution of the Merger Agreement) and then-outstanding unvested Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC
pursuant to the terms thereof or the terms of the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contemplates that McAfee may request Parent’s consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) to the vesting of Company Awards held by current or former employees and service providers prior to the Effective Time that would
otherwise not vest in accordance with their terms or the Special Vesting Opportunity described above.

As part of our ongoing consideration and evaluation of our long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of Directors and McAfee’s senior
management periodically review, consider and assess our operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect
those strategic goals and plans. This

review includes, among other items, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures and other financial
and strategic alternatives, in each case to maximize potential value for McAfee Stockholders.
During the second half of 2019, OpCo LLC and its significant stockholders (i.e., TPG and Intel) (the “significant stockholders”) evaluated several
strategic alternatives, including a potential initial public offering and the potential acquisition of OpCo LLC by a third party. In connection with such
evaluation, Advent, Permira and GIC all entered into separate confidentiality agreements with OpCo LLC. They, along with several other potentially
interested parties, had meetings with the prior management team of OpCo LLC in September and October 2019. After such meetings, for various reasons,
no transaction between any of such parties and OpCo LLC progressed further at that time. Further, OpCo LLC did not complete an initial public offering in
2019. None of the parties with whom OpCo LLC had discussions at the time currently is restricted from making a proposal to acquire OpCo LLC.
Between July 2020 and early October 2020, OpCo LLC and the significant stockholders again evaluated whether there was market interest in a
potential acquisition of OpCo LLC as an alternative to the initial public offering process that OpCo LLC was simultaneously pursuing. As part of this
process, representatives from Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC contacted 28 potential strategic parties. Except as set forth
immediately below, none of such parties, and no members of the Consortium (as defined below), participated in this process. OpCo LLC received one non-
binding preliminary written proposal throughout this process from Strategic Party B. This non-binding preliminary written proposal was received on
October 7, 2020 and signaled the interest of Strategic Party B in acquiring only OpCo LLC’s consumer business but made clear that Strategic Party B was
not interested in acquiring all of OpCo LLC. In addition, Strategic Party B indicated it was unable to pay an all-cash purchase price, and would have
required the stockholders of OpCo LLC to accept equity in Strategic Party B as part of the transaction consideration for such acquisition. Because
Strategic Party B’s letter was preliminary in nature, the significant uncertainty as to whether the proposed transaction would materialize (and at what
price), the fact that Strategic Party B was unable to pay an all-cash purchase price and the private stockholders of OpCo LLC would have been required to
accept equity in Strategic Party B as part of the transaction consideration for the proposed acquisition, the imminence of OpCo LLC’s initial public
offering in the following two weeks and the fact that this was a proposal for only a part of OpCo LLC, OpCo LLC and the significant stockholders elected
not to pursue this alternative further. Conversations with Strategic Party B did not progress beyond a preliminary phase.
McAfee’s initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ (the “IPO”) priced after market close on October 21, 2020, and trading
commenced on October 22, 2020.
In late 2020, management of McAfee and the Board of Directors considered whether there might be market interest in a potential divestiture of
McAfee’s Enterprise business (“Enterprise”). The Board of Directors launched a process for the evaluation of potential interest in Enterprise, which
process lasted from December 2020 until McAfee and an affiliate of Symphony Technology Group entered into a definitive transaction agreement on
March 6, 2021. The Enterprise transaction closed on July 27, 2021. Crosspoint and Advent entered into separate confidentiality agreements with McAfee
in December 2020 and February 2021, respectively, in connection with the Enterprise transaction (due to the possibility that the prior confidentiality
agreement in 2019 between McAfee and Advent could potentially expire during the Enterprise sale process). Both Crosspoint and Advent participated in
meetings with representatives from Goldman Sachs as well as members of McAfee management during the early stages of the Enterprise transaction.
Neither Crosspoint nor Advent reached the final rounds of this process.
In May 2021, consistent with the Board of Directors’ directives to regularly evaluate potential strategic alternatives, and to assess whether there
was any market interest in potential acquisition of McAfee that could be presented to the Board of Directors for consideration, management of McAfee
requested Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, consistent with their roles as financial advisors to McAfee, to lead high-level, preliminary discussions
with potential bidders. Given the increasing importance of cybersecurity at this time, McAfee determined that it would be prudent to assess market
interest in McAfee’s business.

Table of Contents
In total, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, upon consultation with and at the direction of McAfee senior management,
contacted 23 potential financial and strategic parties. In May and June of 2021, members of McAfee’s management team, engaged with a variety of
potential bidders as set forth in greater detail below, including Advent, Permira, CPPIB, Crosspoint, and entities referred to herein as Financial Party A,
Financial Party B, Financial Party C, Financial Party D, Financial Party E, Financial Party F, Financial Party G, Strategic Party A and Strategic Party B. In
May and June of 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had telephone conversations and meetings with Financial Party A,

On May 17, 2021, Timothy Millikin, a director on the Board of Directors who was nominated by TPG (the “sponsor director”) spoke with Bryan
Taylor, a Managing Partner of Advent (the “Advent representative”), by phone. During this conversation, the sponsor director mentioned that
representatives of Goldman Sachs would be reaching out to Advent regarding a potential acquisition of McAfee. On May 18, representatives from
Goldman Sachs held a meeting with Advent to provide a general introduction regarding a potential acquisition of McAfee. Advent did not enter into a
new confidentiality agreement with McAfee, as the prior confidentiality agreement executed in February 2021 between the parties remained in effect.
On May 23, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Permira, as the prior confidentiality agreement in 2019 between McAfee and
Permira had expired.
On May 25, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Strategic Party A. Also on May 25, McAfee entered into a confidentiality
agreement with Financial Party A.
On May 26, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Financial Party B as well as one with Financial Party C. Also on May 26,
representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as members of McAfee management, had a telephone conversation with Financial Party
C to discuss an overview of McAfee’s business generally. Also on May 26, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as members
of McAfee management, held a meeting with Financial Party A.

separate telephone conversations with Strategic Party A and Financial Party B to discuss an overview of McAfee’s business generally. Also on May 27,
representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and members of McAfee management held a meeting with Permira at which a management
presentation was given by McAfee management.

management had a telephone conversation with Strategic Party B to discuss an overview of McAfee’s business generally. Also on May 28, the sponsor
director engaged in a telephone conversation with representatives from Advent related to Advent’s due diligence of McAfee.
On May 29, 2021, a representative from Advent contacted representatives from Goldman Sachs to request that Advent be permitted to formally
partner with Permira, and permission was granted by McAfee shortly thereafter. Additionally, representatives from Advent and Permira separately
discussed with representatives from Goldman Sachs their desire, and sought McAfee’s permission, to partner together in any potential transaction and
form a consortium with Crosspoint to acquire McAfee, which Advent and Permira acknowledged would require McAfee’s consent. McAfee granted
permission to Advent and Permira to partner together and with Crosspoint because of, among other things, the large amount of equity financing that
would be required to consummate any acquisition of McAfee and the greater likelihood that such financing could be obtained if Advent, Permira and
Crosspoint were permitted to partner together to provide this financing.

Crosspoint, CPPIB and each of Strategic Party A, Strategic Party B, Financial Party A, Financial Party B, Financial Party C, Financial Party D, Financial
Party E, Financial Party F and Financial Party G. The purpose of these meetings was to assess each party’s interest in a potential acquisition of McAfee.
These parties generally declined to respond to further invitations to submit a proposal or ceased engaging with representatives from Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley with respect to a potential acquisition of McAfee. The sponsor director also had telephone conversations with Financial Party G and
Financial Party F on June 7 and June 10, respectively; while the purpose of such conversations was to discuss the general status of McAfee’s business,
there was no discussion of potential price or material terms of a potential acquisition of McAfee.

Table of Contents
On or around June 21 through June 26, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and the sponsor director had various discussions with
representatives from Advent, including the Advent representative, and Permira, including discussing additional requests for due diligence information of
McAfee. Bryan Taylor was formerly a partner at TPG (having left that position in September 2017) and the prior chairman of the board of directors of
OpCo LLC (having left that position in July 2017).
On June 23, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sent a process letter to Advent, Permira, Crosspoint, CPPIB, Financial
Party B, Financial Party D, Financial Party F and Financial Party G, requesting submissions of preliminary, non-binding written indications of interest on
an adjusted equity value basis that outline the terms and conditions of a potential transaction with McAfee. Shortly thereafter, Financial Party D
contacted representatives from Goldman Sachs to inform them that they would no longer pursue a potential acquisition of McAfee.
Throughout late June 2021, CPPIB communicated to Goldman Sachs its interest in partnering with Advent regarding a potential transaction given
Advent’s prior experience in the security software industry. McAfee denied this request due to its desire to have more separate bidders, and
representatives of Goldman Sachs instructed CPPIB to bid independently.
On June 25, 2021, certain members of McAfee management and representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley held a meeting with
Financial Party G, at which Financial Party G indicated interest in a potential acquisition of McAfee.
On June 29, 2021, representatives from Financial Party D contacted representatives from Goldman Sachs by telephone and indicated that they
would not pursue further a potential acquisition of McAfee.
On June 30, 2021, four potentially interested parties submitted non-binding written indications of interest for an acquisition of McAfee based on
limited preliminary information, in each case subject to further diligence. Advent, Permira and Crosspoint submitted a joint, non-binding indication of
interest at an enterprise value of $15.0 billion, inclusive of certain presumed but unverified tax benefits. CPPIB submitted a separate non-binding
indication of interest at an enterprise value of $14.25 billion, and noted that its bid was premised on the ability to partner with at least one other private
equity investor. Financial Party G submitted a non-binding indication of interest at an enterprise value of $14 billion, and similarly noted that it would seek
to partner with at least one other like-minded private equity investor. Financial Party F submitted a written non-binding indication of interest that did not
include an enterprise value. Also, on June 30, 2021, Financial Party B submitted a separate oral indication of interest that did not include an enterprise
value and was also premised on the ability to partner with at least one other investor. All other potential interested parties elected not to submit any
proposal (whether orally or in writing) and did not pursue further a potential acquisition of McAfee.
Each of the four written non-binding indications of interest included a preliminary estimate from each interested party of McAfee’s adjusted equity
value, exclusive of net debt, and (for several proposals) inclusive of certain tax assets that would be delivered to a potential acquirer. These estimates
were highly preliminary, were subject to diligence caveats and did not include or express any fixed per share price that would be paid that would facilitate
comparison across bidders. However, Goldman Sachs estimated various illustrative per share values implied by each of the non-binding indication of
interests based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions with respect to the dividends and debt payments that McAfee anticipated making in
respect of the sale of the Enterprise business, and cash forecasted to be generated through the end of 2021. Goldman Sachs’ illustrative estimates of
implied per share values with respect to each non-binding indication of interest was as follows: $26.87 per share for Advent, Permira and Crosspoint’s;
$26.45 per share for CPPIB’s; $24.63 per share for Financial Party G’s; $22.83 per share for Financial Party F’s; and $25.50 to $26.50 per share for Financial
Party B’s.
On July 2, 2021, the Board of Directors held a board meeting. Also in attendance were members of McAfee management, and representatives from
Goldman Sachs and Ropes. Representatives from Goldman Sachs briefed the Board of Directors on the status of discussions with potential parties,
including Advent, Permira and Crosspoint’s continued interest in pursuing a transaction with McAfee. Representatives from Goldman Sachs
 
39
Table of Contents
reviewed with the Board of Directors the indications of interest received to date. Representatives from Goldman Sachs also provided an overview of the
proposed transaction timeline, with potential buyers conducting diligence through July 2021 and submitting final bids by the first week of August 2021. A
representative from Ropes then reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. The Board of Directors discussed
potential conflicts of interest that could arise in connection with a potential transaction, including the acceleration of potential payments to be made
under the TRA upon an acquisition of McAfee. The Board of Directors further discussed possible alternatives to eliminate or mitigate any such potential
conflicts should they arise, and to align the interests of pre-IPO stockholders of McAfee and all other McAfee Stockholders in obtaining the highest
available price in any acquisition of McAfee. Following discussion, the Board of Directors provided direction to Goldman Sachs on the guidance to
provide the various bidders.
On July 3, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs advised Financial Party B that it could partner with Financial Party G, given both that
Financial Party B and Financial Party G had indicated an interest in partnering with one another, as well as the significant equity financing requirements to
consummate an acquisition. Around this time, representatives from Goldman Sachs separately advised Financial Party F that their proposal was not
actionable on the pricing terms set forth in their proposal and encouraged them to submit more favorable pricing terms. Financial Party F declined to
submit more favorable terms and, with certain exceptions (described below), did not pursue further a potential acquisition of McAfee.
On July 4, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley formally connected Financial Party B with Financial Party G to form a
joint consortium.
On July 5, 2021, a representative from Goldman Sachs communicated that McAfee had granted permission to Advent, Permira and Crosspoint to
utilize ADIA as a potential equity financing source.
McAfee granted permission to CPPIB (on July 9, 2021) to partner with Advent, Permira and Crosspoint (Advent and Permira as lead investors, with
CPPIB and Crosspoint as named co-investors and ADIA (on July 9, 2021) and GIC (on July 12, 2021) as equity financing sources, collectively, the
“Consortium”) regarding a potential transaction. Permission was granted to CPPIB because of, among other things, CPPIB’s interest in partnering with
Advent and Permira, which interest CPPIB had previously communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs.
Also on July 9, 2021, representatives from each of Financial Party B and Financial Party G notified a representative from Goldman Sachs that they
would no longer pursue a potential acquisition of McAfee, indicating that they had decided not to proceed. Going forward as from this date, the sole
bidder materially engaging in the process was the Consortium.
On July 12, 2021, McAfee also granted permission to GIC to transfer its interest in McAfee to Parent, and to receive equity in Parent as payment
therefor.
On July 14, 15 and 16, 2021, members of McAfee management held a series of meetings jointly attended by Advent, Permira, CPPIB, Crosspoint and
ADIA. On or around this time, representatives from Goldman Sachs and the sponsor director communicated with representatives from Advent, which
communications primarily related to a potential acquisition of McAfee. During this time, Ropes prepared a form of merger agreement and forms of other
transaction agreements that could be delivered to a potential strategic acquirer or a potential financial acquirer, should there be sufficient interest in and a
determination by the Board of Directors to further pursue a potential acquisition of McAfee. On July 16, 2021, a draft form of merger agreement was
provided by McAfee to the Consortium.
On July 20, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sent a process letter to the Consortium requesting submission of a
definitive written proposal for the acquisition of McAfee by August 5, 2021 and noting that the Board of Directors would consider such matters as it
deemed appropriate in evaluating such proposals, including (i) price, (ii) certainty and timing of closing such a transaction and (iii) the draft transaction
documents. The July 20, 2021 bid process letter specifically requested bids on a per share basis.
On July 30, 2021, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP (“Fried Frank”), counsel to the Consortium, sent an issues list to Ropes, which
identified issues for discussion in the draft merger agreement. The issues list
 
40
Table of Contents
also indicated that the Consortium would expect to receive a customary voting agreement from certain significant stockholders of McAfee in connection
with any transaction. Such voting agreement would require, among other things, that certain significant stockholders of McAfee vote in favor of the
contemplated transaction (subject to certain exceptions) with the Consortium.
On July 30, 2021, the Board of Directors held a board meeting by video conference. Also present were members of McAfee management, as well as
representatives from Goldman Sachs and Ropes. Representatives from Goldman Sachs then provided an overview of the diligence process. Ropes
reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, and also reviewed the issues list with respect to the draft merger
agreement provided by Fried Frank. Discussion ensued among the directors. With input from representatives from Goldman Sachs and Ropes, the Board
of Directors also discussed potential conflicts of interest, including the acceleration of potential payments due under the TRA. A representative from
Ropes informed the Board of Directors that each of TPG and Intel had agreed that they would be willing to waive any acceleration of TRA payments
otherwise due upon a change of control of McAfee in order to obtain the highest price per share for all McAfee Stockholders. In addition, certain
preliminary, projected financial information was reviewed with the Board of Directors, including preliminary projections that had been prepared by
McAfee on May 29, 2021 and subsequently made available to prospective bidders (the “May 29 Projections”), as well as certain other preliminary,
projected financial information. In addition, certain preliminary, projected financial information was reviewed with the Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors asked questions and discussion ensued.
The Board of Directors instructed representatives from Goldman Sachs and Ropes to notify Fried Frank that a full markup of the merger agreement
would be required before a substantive discussion on the merger agreement could occur.
On July 30 and August 1, 2021, the sponsor director had telephone conversations with Financial Party F during which the sponsor director
encouraged Financial Party F to consider leading a potential acquisition of McAfee, as well as general discussions around the quality of McAfee’s
business.
On August 3, 2021, representatives of Ropes and Fried Frank spoke by telephone. During such conversation, representatives of Ropes indicated to
representatives of Fried Frank that a full markup of the merger agreement would be required before a substantive discussion on the merger agreement
could occur.
On or around August 4 through August 7, 2021, various telephone conversations between representatives from McAfee and Advent occurred
regarding the Consortium’s due diligence requests.
On August 10 through August 17, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs spoke with Permira on the current nature of their interest in a
transaction and encouraged them to advance and complete their diligence and improve the terms of their proposal.
On August 14, 2021, Fried Frank, on behalf of the Consortium, submitted to Ropes a full markup of the merger agreement, which, among other
things, reflected the Consortium’s expectation that certain significant stockholders of McAfee sign a voting agreement in connection with any
contemplated transaction.
On August 17, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs spoke with Advent and Permira and encouraged Advent and Permira and other members
of the Consortium to improve the terms of their proposal and to move quickly to be in a position to execute a transaction. Permira called representatives
from Goldman Sachs and indicated that the Consortium continued to have open diligence issues that prevented them from improving their terms or
making a final proposal.
On August 19, 2021, McAfee terminated discussions with the Consortium, due to, among other things, disagreements about the terms and timeline
upon which any transaction would occur as well as disagreements about access to due diligence materials related to McAfee.

On September 7, 2021, McAfee publicly announced an underwritten public offering of 20,000,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock by certain
selling McAfee Stockholders, which public offering was completed on September 14, 2021.
On September 23, 2021, in a conversation about other topics with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Financial Party G confirmed they continued
to not have interest in a potential acquisition of McAfee.
On October 6, 2021, a representative from Advent contacted the sponsor director by telephone and discussed the Consortium’s potential interest in
re-engaging with McAfee regarding a potential acquisition of McAfee. Shortly thereafter, the representative from Advent discussed with McAfee
management and representatives from Goldman Sachs the Consortium’s potential interest in re-engaging. 
On October 8, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs, as well as members of McAfee management, held a meeting with representatives from
Advent, Permira, CPPIB, Crosspoint, ADIA and GIC to discuss McAfee’s third quarter financials. At this meeting, there was no discussion of the
potential price or material terms of a potential acquisition of McAfee.
On October 13, 2021, Advent, Permira, Crosspoint and CPPIB submitted a revised non-binding proposal to McAfee providing for an acquisition by
the Consortium of McAfee at a price per share of $25.00 in cash, representing a premium over the closing price of $20.60 per share on that day, or
approximately 21%. This proposal also attached a further revised markup of the merger agreement. In comparison to the August 14, 2021 markup that was
submitted by Fried Frank, the October 13, 2021 markup, which, included, among other things, a higher proposed Parent Termination Fee, a lower proposed
Company Termination Fee and favorable changes to the go-shop and no-shop provisions, certain critical definitions, the financing covenants, the
representations and warranties, and the conduct of business covenant. The October 13, 2021 proposal also contained a request that McAfee sign a letter
with Advent, Permira, Crosspoint and CPPIB providing for four weeks of exclusivity.
On October 14, 2021, the Board of Directors held a board meeting. Also in attendance were members of McAfee management and representatives
from Goldman Sachs and Ropes. Representatives from Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board of Directors the terms of the Consortium’s October 13,
2021 proposal, as well as Goldman Sachs’ preliminary financial analysis of the $25.00 price per share proposed in the October 13 proposal. A
representative from Ropes reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, and then also reviewed with the Board of
Directors the material terms of the October 13 markup of the merger agreement and the request for exclusivity. Discussion ensued among the directors.
The Board of Directors deliberated on the improved terms of the October 13 proposal, including the request by Advent, Permira, Crosspoint and CPPIB
for exclusivity. The Board of Directors instructed its legal and financial advisors to speak with Advent, Permira, Crosspoint and CPPIB’s advisors and
seek to further improve the terms of the October 13 proposal.
At the board meeting, it was also discussed that an affiliate of GIC that is a current McAfee Stockholder was having discussions to join the
Consortium. Neither GIC nor such affiliate had at the time or currently has any representative on the Board of Directors. Further, neither was privy to any
of the discussions or developments being discussed by the Board of Directors or involved in any discussions between McAfee and the Consortium.
Additional discussion ensued among the directors. Subsequent to the October 14, 2021 board meeting, at the direction of the Board of Directors, a
representative from Goldman Sachs conveyed to the Consortium that they would need to improve their proposed per share price to an amount above
$25.00 per share.
Shortly after this meeting of the Board of Directors, a representative from Goldman Sachs communicated to the Consortium that McAfee would not
enter into an exclusivity agreement in connection with the ongoing negotiations and that the Consortium would need to further improve the $25.00 per
share offer price. Because of this, McAfee did not enter into any exclusivity agreement with representatives from the Consortium or any members thereof
prior to execution of the merger agreement.

On October 15, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and members of McAfee management held a meeting with Advent, Permira, CPPIB and
Crosspoint to discuss due diligence matters.
On October 19, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and members of McAfee management held another meeting with Advent, Permira, CPPIB
and Crosspoint to discuss due diligence matters. Also on October 19, 2021, in accordance with the instructions of the Board of Directors, Ropes prepared
a revised draft of the merger agreement that made numerous changes to Fried Frank’s most recent draft that were favorable to McAfee, and Ropes sent
that draft to Fried Frank. These changes, among other things: provided that the quarterly dividend would be paid; permitted McAfee to make certain “Tax
Distributions” (as defined under the OpCo LLC Agreement) to members of OpCo LLC; provided that McAfee would be permitted to make certain
payments that it had previously been expecting to make in 2022 unrelated to any change of control of McAfee in accordance with the express terms of the
TRA that were unrelated to the proposed transaction (the “Ordinary Course TRA Payments”); lowered the proposed Company Termination Fee to 1.25%
or 2.5%; increased the proposed Parent Termination Fee to 7%; and revised various provisions including the go-shop and no-shop provisions, the Board
of Directors’ right to make an adverse recommendation change, the treatment of equity awards, the closing conditions, the financing of the transaction,
efforts to obtain regulatory clearances, the conduct of business covenant, the representations and warranties, and termination rights. In this draft, Ropes
also included language indicating that certain parties to the TRA would agree to the termination of the TRA effective upon closing and to the waiver of
the accelerated termination payment contemplated by the TRA that would otherwise result from the transaction. The draft further specified that, to the
extent that McAfee would otherwise have made any payments under the TRA absent a transaction, those amounts would be paid out by McAfee prior to
closing.
On October 21, 2021, the sponsor director had a telephone conversation with Financial Party F in which Financial Party F expressed potential
interest in a private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) transaction involving McAfee. However, Financial Party F did not provide any specificity
regarding terms or timing of such proposed PIPE transaction, and Financial Party F made clear that it was not willing to consider an acquisition of 100% of
the equity interests of McAfee. Also on October 21, representatives from Goldman Sachs and members of McAfee management held a meeting with
representatives from Advent, Permira, CPPIB and Crosspoint to discuss due diligence matters.
On October 22, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and members of McAfee management held meetings with representatives from the
Consortium to discuss due diligence matters.
On October 23, 2021, Fried Frank sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Ropes. Among other things, the October 23 revised merger
agreement accepted the 1.25% or 2.5% proposed Company Termination Fee, proposed a 5% Parent Termination Fee, revised various provisions including
changes to the go-shop and no-shop provisions, the Board of Directors’ right to make an adverse recommendation change, the treatment of equity
awards, the closing conditions, the financing of the transaction, efforts to obtain regulatory clearances, the conduct of business covenant, the
representations and warranties, and termination rights.
On October 25, 2021, members of McAfee management along with representatives from each of Goldman Sachs and Ropes met to discuss the
revised terms proposed in the October 23 revised merger agreement. Consistent with the Board of Directors’ instruction to management and McAfee’s
advisers, the group discussed how to improve further the terms of the merger agreement for all McAfee Stockholders generally. Also on October 25, 2021
members of McAfee management held telephone conversations with representatives from the Consortium to discuss certain items related to McAfee’s
balance sheet.
On October 26, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and members of McAfee management held meetings with
representatives from the Consortium to discuss certain items related to human resources and cybersecurity matters. Also on October 26, 2021 and on
October 27, 2021, representatives of Ropes and Fried Frank held telephone conversations to discuss the draft merger agreement sent by Fried Frank on
October 23, 2021.

On October 27, 2021, Ropes sent to Fried Frank an initial draft of a voting agreement to be signed by TPG and Intel, pursuant to which TPG and
Intel would agree to vote, at a meeting of the McAfee Stockholders, their respective shares of Company Stock in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement. The terms of the voting agreement provided that the voting support provided therein by TPG and Intel would immediately cease in the event
that the Board of Directors made an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminated the merger agreement.
Also on October 27, 2021, a representative from Goldman Sachs, representatives from Deloitte and members of McAfee management held a meeting
with representatives from the Consortium concerning the proposed transaction, including the financial and other terms.
On October 28, 2021, Ropes sent a further revised draft of the merger agreement to Fried Frank. The revised draft of the merger agreement contained
proposed revisions related to, among other things, the treatment of equity awards, the closing conditions, the financing of the transaction, efforts to
obtain regulatory clearances, the terms of the “go shop” provision and the “no shop” provision, the Board of Directors’ right to make an adverse
recommendation change, the conduct of business covenant, representations and warranties, termination rights, the proposed Parent Termination Fee and
other matters. Also on October 28, representatives from Goldman Sachs and members of McAfee management held telephone conversations with
representatives from the Consortium to discuss certain items related to due diligence and operating matters.
On October 29, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting. Also present were members of McAfee management, as well as representatives from
Goldman Sachs and Ropes. A representative from Goldman Sachs noted that negotiations with the Consortium were continuing, and that as part of its
most recent proposal, the Consortium had requested that McAfee suspend its quarterly dividend and for the TRA counterparties to waive the Ordinary
Course TRA Payments. The Board of Directors directed Goldman Sachs and McAfee management to continue to seek a more favorable price per share
from the Consortium.
A representative from Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Board of Directors the current financial terms of the proposed transaction. Discussion
ensued among the directors. A representative from Goldman Sachs noted that Financial Party F had contacted the sponsor director to propose a PIPE
transaction with McAfee, but that Financial Party F was not interested in an acquisition of all of McAfee, and that it was unclear how serious Financial
Party F was with respect to the PIPE transaction or what timeline Financial Party F was contemplating for such a transaction. A representative from
Goldman Sachs also noted that they recently spoke again with Financial Party G to assess Financial Party G’s willingness to make a proposal to acquire
McAfee. However, Financial Party G declined to make a proposal.
During the meeting, a representative from Ropes reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, and also reviewed
with the Board of Directors the status of the negotiations on the merger agreement. The representative from Ropes noted that while substantial progress
had been made on the principal transaction agreements, certain open issues remained. In particular, the representative from Ropes noted that the parties
were still negotiating, among other open points, the closing conditions, acceleration of equity awards, financing of the transaction, certain critical
definitions, efforts to obtain regulatory clearances, the terms of the “go shop” provision and the “no shop” provision, the Board of Directors’ rights to
make an adverse recommendation change, the quarterly dividend, the Tax Distributions and the Ordinary Course TRA Payments, the proposed Parent
Termination Fee and other matters. The directors deliberated on the open points and instructed members of management and representatives from
Goldman Sachs and Ropes to seek to obtain the most favorable terms possible for McAfee Stockholders.
The chief financial officer of McAfee then reviewed with the Board of Directors the proposed long term strategic plan (the “Strategic Plan”) for
McAfee, and discussed numerous topics relevant to the Strategic Plan, including assumptions and financial projections underlying the Strategic Plan.
Certain assumptions reflected in the financial projections prepared in connection with the Strategic Plan had been updated from prior assumptions that
had been
 
44
Table of Contents
made in connection with the May 29 Projections. The updated assumptions were based on subsequent developments, including without limitation the
potential impact of recently announced M&A transactions and market activity that impacted McAfee’s competitive landscape, as well as additional
strategic planning meetings conducted with the input of a new executive officer who joined after McAfee became a consumer-only company. The
updated assumptions reflected in the financial projections resulted in lower forecasted growth in McAfee’s Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation,
and Amortization (“EBITDA”) as compared to the May 29 Projections, among other updates. Discussion then ensued among the directors on the
Strategic Plan. After deliberation, the Board of Directors approved the Strategic Plan as financial projections of the McAfee business and instructed
representatives from Goldman Sachs to provide the Strategic Plan to the Consortium.
Also on October 29, representatives from Goldman Sachs and members of McAfee management held a meeting with the Consortium to discuss due
diligence matters.
On October 30, 2021, representatives from Ropes and Fried Frank spoke by phone to address a number of provisions in the merger agreement,
including among others the closing conditions, acceleration of equity awards, equity financing of the transaction and the marketing period, the “ordinary
course” and “material adverse effect” definitions, efforts to obtain regulatory clearances, the terms of the “go shop” provision and the “no shop”
provision, the Board of Directors’ rights to make an adverse recommendation change, the conduct of business covenant (including the quarterly
dividend, the Tax Distributions and the Ordinary Course TRA Payments), the representations and warranties, and the size of the proposed Parent
Termination Fee, among other provisions. Later that day, Fried Frank sent a revised draft of the voting agreement to Ropes, as well as drafts of the equity
commitment letter and the fee funding agreement to be signed by each applicable member of the Consortium.
Between October 31 to November 4, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs engaged in numerous discussions with the Consortium regarding
the financial terms of the proposed transaction. During this period, Ropes and Fried Frank also convened numerous meetings to negotiate the terms of,
and exchanged numerous drafts of, the merger agreement, the voting agreement, the equity commitment letter, the fee funding agreement, the amendment
to the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement and other transaction agreements.
On November 2, 2021, Fried Frank sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Ropes. Also on November 2, the sponsor director had a
telephone conversation with a representative from Advent to discuss due diligence matters relating to McAfee. The sponsor director also reiterated the
Board of Directors’ feedback that the Consortium should increase the proposed price per share; a representative from Goldman Sachs separately
communicated this guidance to Permira.
On November 3, 2021, Ropes and Fried Frank spoke by phone to negotiate certain provisions of the merger agreement, including among other
terms, the “material adverse effect” definition, terms of the go shop provision and the no shop provision, the Board of Directors’ rights to make an
adverse recommendation change, the marketing period, the conduct of the business covenant, the covenant regarding efforts to obtain regulatory
clearances, the size of the proposed Parent Termination Fee and other provisions. Also on November 3, Fried Frank provided to Ropes draft debt
commitment letters and the proposed equity contribution agreement to be signed by an affiliate of GIC. Also on November 3, representatives from
Goldman Sachs and the sponsor director had several separate conversations with representatives from each of Advent and Permira.
On November 4, 2021, representatives of Advent and Permira, on behalf of the Consortium, spoke by phone with representatives of Goldman
Sachs. On that call, the representatives of Advent and Permira, on behalf of the Consortium, delivered a proposal to resolve a number of open points.
Later on November 4, 2021, Fried Frank sent a written proposal, which reflected the terms previously conveyed to Goldman Sachs, to Ropes. The
proposal, among other things, proposed a price per share of $25.75; limited acceleration of equity awards, permitted McAfee to make the Tax Distributions
to members of OpCo LLC; required that the TRA be terminated conditional upon the occurrence of the Closing; required the Ordinary Course TRA
Payments to be canceled; required that the quarterly dividend be suspended; provided for a proposed 5% Parent Termination Fee; accepted proposed
compromises on the “material adverse effect” and “intervening event” definitions, and other matters.

Table of Contents
On November 4, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and the sponsor director had separate telephone conversations with representatives
from Advent and Permira, and a representative from McAfee had a separate telephone conversation with representatives from Advent, regarding the
proposal, including potential modifications to the terms of the merger agreement that would raise the price per share to $26.00 in cash (representing a
premium over the then-current share price of approximately 22.6%) and suspend and, upon the closing of the Merger, terminate McAfee’s obligation to
make the Tax Distributions to members of OpCo LLC. Ropes sent a counterproposal (the “McAfee Counterproposal”) back to Fried Frank containing
these modifications and otherwise in general accepting the other terms of the Consortium’s November 4 proposal. After additional discussion between
the parties, the Consortium agreed to the McAfee Counterproposal. Also on November 4, representatives from Goldman Sachs and the sponsor director
had separate telephone conversations with representatives from Advent and Permira clarifying the terms of the limited acceleration of equity awards.
Also on November 4, Fried Frank provided to Ropes draft preferred equity commitment letters.
During the evening of November 4, 2021, the Board of Directors held a board meeting by video conference. A representative from Goldman Sachs
provided an update to the Board of Directors and communicated that the Consortium had agreed to increase the price per Class A Common Stock share to
$26.00 in cash and otherwise described the McAfee Counterproposal that had been accepted by the Consortium. The representative from Goldman Sachs
noted that this approach was consistent with the Board of Directors’ previous discussions. A representative from Goldman Sachs then reviewed its
financial analyses and rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
November 5, 2021, to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in
Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the $26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock to be paid to the McAfee Stockholders (other than Parent, Snowlake and
their respective Affiliates), taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such McAfee
Stockholders as further described in the section “—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC”.
A representative from Ropes then reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. The representative from Ropes
next reviewed with the Board of Directors the status of the negotiations with the Consortium and its advisors and that there were still items under
negotiation in the draft merger agreement, and that Ropes and Goldman Sachs were still negotiating those items. The representative from Ropes reviewed
with the Board of Directors the terms of the transaction agreements reflective of the McAfee Counterproposal, including, without limitation, the terms of
the merger agreement, including without limitation the structure of the merger, limited acceleration of equity awards, the “go shop” provision, the “no
shop” provision, the Board of Directors’ rights to make an adverse recommendation change, the proposed Company Termination Fee of 1.25% or 2.5%,
and the proposed Parent Termination Fee of 5%, efforts to obtain regulatory clearances, closing conditions, the definition of “material adverse effect;” the
voting agreement that would be signed by TPG and Intel to support the transaction and the fact that the voting support under that voting agreement
would immediately cease upon the Board of Directors making an adverse recommendation change or upon termination of the merger agreement;
suspension of the quarterly dividend; the amendment to the TRA and OpCo LLC Agreement to effect the suspension and, conditional upon the
occurrence of the Closing, the elimination of certain payments due under the TRA (including the Ordinary Course TRA Payments and any change of
control payments associated with the transaction) and Tax Distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement; the equity commitment letters; the debt
commitment letters; the fee funding agreements; and the agreement to be signed by the affiliate of GIC and the Consortium. Discussion then ensued
among the Board of Directors and with their advisors. The directors discussed the favorable outcome on the improvement of the price to $26.00 per share
in cash payable to all of the McAfee Stockholders generally, and instructed management, and representatives from Ropes and Goldman Sachs to resolve
any remaining open points in a manner as favorable as possible to the McAfee Stockholders and otherwise in accordance with the Board of Directors’
instructions. Subject to that instruction, the Board of Directors authorized management to execute and deliver the merger agreement and the other
transaction agreements once the McAfee Counterproposal had been reflected in the transaction agreements and any remaining open points had been
resolved. The compensation committee of the Board of Directors also met and adopted resolutions to authorize the treatment of equity awards as
provided in the merger agreement.
During the evening of November 4, 2021 and continuing throughout November 5, 2021, the parties memorialized the McAfee Counterproposal in
the transaction agreements and continued to negotiate and resolve
 
46
Table of Contents
the open points in the merger agreement and the other transaction agreements. Late in the afternoon on November 5, several news outlets published a
story that McAfee was considering a proposed transaction with the Consortium. At the close of trading on November 5, 2021, McAfee’s stock price had
increased approximately 20% over the previous day’s closing price. Also on November 5, members of McAfee management and representatives from
Goldman Sachs held a meeting with representatives from Advent, Permira, CPPIB and Crosspoint. In addition, on November 5, 2021, representatives from
Goldman Sachs delivered to the Board of Directors an updated written presentation of certain financial analyses to reflect the most recent capitalization of
McAfee included in the November 5, 2021 draft of the merger agreement. Late in the evening on November 5, the parties executed and delivered the
Merger Agreement and the other principal transaction agreements, including the amendment to the TRA and OpCo LLC Agreement executed and
delivered by holders of the requisite percentage of beneficiaries to the TRA.
Upon the execution of the Merger Agreement, all standstill provisions (that were contained in confidentiality agreements with prospective bidders)
providing for a fall away upon a public announcement of a sale of McAfee, automatically released, except as set forth below. The confidentiality
agreements between McAfee and three potentially interested parties each contained a standstill restriction and a “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision
prohibiting the potentially interested parties from requesting that McAfee waive or amend the standstill restrictions, but did not provide for a fall away
upon a public announcement of a sale of McAfee. On December 20, 2021, McAfee advised each of these three potentially interested parties that McAfee
was waiving the standstill provision (including the “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision) in the confidentiality agreements in order to permit each of these
parties to make a private and confidential acquisition proposal to the Board of Directors.
Also on November 5, 2021, Goldman Sachs delivered its written opinion to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of the date of such written
opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock to be paid to the
McAfee Stockholders (other than Parent, Snowlake and their respective Affiliates), taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such McAfee Stockholders.
On the morning of November 8, 2021, McAfee and the Consortium publicly announced the entry into the Merger Agreement via a joint press
release.
On November 19, 2021, McAfee, Parent and Merger Subsidiary executed an amendment to the Merger Agreement to remove certain jurisdictions
from the closing conditions set forth in Sections 9.01(b) and 9.01(c) relating to certain regulatory approvals and restraints. Since the execution of the
Merger Agreement, in connection with the Go Shop Period provided for in the Merger Agreement, which expired at 11:59 p.m. New York City Time on
December 20, 2021, at the direction of the Board of Directors, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have communicated with 37
additional parties, consisting of 18 potential strategic parties and 19 potential financial sponsors, to gauge such parties’ interest in making an alternative
Acquisition Proposal. McAfee did not execute a confidentiality agreement with any of those 37 parties. To date, no party has made an alternative
Acquisition Proposal.",44,56

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has: (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Merger) are
fair to and in the best interests of McAfee and the McAfee Stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Merger) and thereby, and (iii) resolved, subject to Section 6.03 of the Merger
Agreement, to recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by the McAfee Stockholders.

basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the
 
47Table of Contents
adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Board of Directors consulted with McAfee’s management and its legal and financial
advisors and, in reaching its decision to, among other things, approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger and to recommend that McAfee
Stockholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors considered a variety of factors, including the following:
 
 
•
 historical information regarding (i) McAfee’s business, financial performance and results of operations, (ii) market prices, volatility and
trading activity with respect to the Company Stock, and (iii) market prices with respect to other industry participants and general market
indices;
 
 
•
 current information regarding (i) McAfee’s business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, products, services,
management, competitive position and strategic business goals and objectives, (ii) general economic, industry and financial market
conditions, (iii) geopolitical conditions (including, without limitation, tariffs and COVID-19) which are affecting McAfee’s business, and (iv)
opportunities and competitive factors within McAfee’s industry;
 
 
•
 ongoing efforts and uncertainty relating to COVID-19;
 
 
•
 the changing competitive landscape, including acquisitions and dispositions by competitors and solicitation by competitors of McAfee of
customers (including OEMs) of McAfee’s business;
 
 
•
 the historically high stock prices of public companies in equity markets generally;
 
 
•
 the prospects and likelihood of realizing superior benefits through remaining an independent company, risks associated with remaining an
independent company, and possible alternative business strategies;
 
 
•
 the potential for third parties other than Parent to enter into strategic relationships with or to seek to acquire McAfee, including a review of
McAfee’s dealings with other possible buyers in the past and assessment of the likelihood that a third party would offer a higher price than
the price per share of Company Stock offered by Parent;
 
 
•
 the timing of the Merger and the risk that if McAfee does not accept the Parent offer now (as provided for in the Merger Agreement), it may
not have another opportunity to do so or to accept a comparable opportunity;
 
 
•
 the fact that the value of the Merger Consideration as provided for in the Merger Agreement represents a substantial premium above
McAfee’s stock price prior to news of the transaction being publicly available;
 
 
•
 the fact that the amount of cash to be received for each outstanding share of Company Stock is fixed and will not be reduced if the share
price of Company Stock declines prior to the effective time of the Merger;
 
 
•
 the fact that representatives from McAfee and Goldman Sachs conducted a review of McAfee’s strategic alternatives and, in connection
therewith, contacted numerous potential counterparties regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of McAfee;
 
 
•
 the belief of the Board of Directors that it is preferable to enter into the Merger Agreement with Parent instead of any of the other
prospective interested parties in the strategic alternatives process in light of the prices offered by those other prospective interested
parties, the lack of interest by prospective interested parties and the fact that those other prospective interested parties made significantly
less progress on due diligence, particularly in light of:
 
 
•
 (1) the risk that continuing with the strategic process was unlikely to result in a transaction at a more attractive price than offered by
Parent in the Merger and that a “failed” attempt to sell McAfee could be detrimental to McAfee; and
 
48
Table of Contents
 
•
 (2) the fact that McAfee had the Go Shop Period in which to seek a higher priced offer;
 
 
•
 the fact that, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, McAfee and Parent have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate
the Merger and the others transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, including (i) preparing and filing
as promptly as practicable after the date hereof with any Governmental Authority all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, financial statements, records, applications and other documents, in each
case, as required; (ii) obtaining and maintaining as required by the Merger Agreement all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations, licenses, waivers, and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority that are necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) defending or contesting any action, suit or proceeding
challenging this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) executing and delivering any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
 
 
•
 the fact that the Sponsors are well-known private equity sponsors;
 
 
•
 the fact that (1) the Merger Agreement contains a “go shop” provision permitting McAfee to actively solicit parties to seek to obtain a
higher offer during the Go-Shop Period together with the payment of the Company Termination Fee, (2) after the Go Shop Period, McAfee
can still entertain unsolicited acquisition proposals that are more favorable from a financial perspective, (3) the Merger Agreement obligates
McAfee to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee under specified circumstances, which could discourage the making of a competing
acquisition proposal or adversely impact the price offered in such a proposal;
 
 
•
 the fact that the Merger Agreement obligates Parent to pay a termination fee of 5% of the equity value of McAfee to McAfee under
specified circumstances, and that funds affiliated with each Sponsor and certain other co-investors have signed a Fee Funding Agreement
to backstop the payment of such fee;
 
 
•
 the belief of the Board of Directors that an acquisition by Parent has a reasonable likelihood of closing without potential issues under
applicable antitrust and competition laws or potential issues from any regulatory authorities;
 
 
•
 the fact that the adoption of the Merger Agreement is not subject to the approval of Parent’s stockholders;
 
 
•
 the absence of a financing condition to the closing of the Merger, and Parent’s representations and warranties relating to the equity
commitment letters, the agreement between Snowlake and the Consortium, the debt commitment letters and preferred equity commitment
letters, the fee funding agreements and solvency;
 
 
•
 the written opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board of Directors that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock to be paid to the McAfee
Stockholders (other than Parent, Snowlake and their respective Affiliates), taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such McAfee Stockholders; for more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC;”
 
 
•
 the fact that McAfee will no longer exist as an independent public company after Closing and the McAfee Stockholders will forgo any
future increase in the value of their equity interest in McAfee that might result from its possible growth, change or expansion;
 
 
•
 the possible negative effect of the Merger and public announcement of the Merger on McAfee’s financial performance, operating results
and stock price and McAfee’s relationships with customers, suppliers, other business partners, management and employees;
 
 
•
 the fact that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the conduct of McAfee’s business in the pre-closing period, which may
adversely affect McAfee’s business in the event the Merger is not
 
49
Table of Contents
 
completed (including by delaying or preventing McAfee from pursuing business opportunities that may arise or by precluding actions that
would be advisable if McAfee were to remain an independent company);
 
 
•
 the risks involved with the Merger and the likelihood that McAfee and Parent will be able to complete the Merger, the possibility that the
Merger might not be consummated and McAfee’s prospects going forward without the combination with Parent;
 
 
•
 the substantial transaction expenses to be incurred in connection with the Merger and the negative impact of such expenses on McAfee’s
cash reserves and operating results should the Merger not be completed;
 
 
•
 the fact that TPG and Intel were signing a voting agreement with Parent to vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
against any other acquisition proposal, and the fact that the voting support under such voting agreement ceases immediately upon an
adverse recommendation change or the termination of the Merger Agreement;
 
 
•
 the fact that the Amendment is being entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement so as to suspend and subject to the
occurrence of Closing, terminate any tax distributions payable by McAfee to members under the OpCo LLC Agreement and to suspend
certain payment obligations under and, subject to the occurrence of Closing, to terminate the TRA and to eliminate any payment obligation
of McAfee to the parties thereto that would otherwise have become due as a result of the Merger under the original terms of the TRA;
 
 
•
 the fact that the Merger Agreement requires McAfee to suspend the payment of its quarterly dividend;
 
 
•
 all known interests of directors and executive officers of McAfee in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, their interests as
McAfee Stockholders or the interests of other McAfee Stockholders generally, including (i) rights and benefits pursuant to the TRA and in
respect of tax distributions payable by McAfee to members under the OpCo LLC Agreement, as modified by the Amendment and (ii) that
certain officers of McAfee are entitled to severance and other benefits pursuant to agreements with McAfee in connection with certain
qualifying terminations occurring after the consummation of the Merger; and
 
 
•
 all other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.
After considering the foregoing potentially negative and potentially positive factors, the Board of Directors concluded that the potentially positive
factors relating to the merger agreement and the merger substantially outweighed the potentially negative factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not exhaustive, but is intended to reflect the
material factors considered by the Board of Directors in its consideration of the Merger. In view of the complexity, and the large number of the factors
considered, the Board of Directors, both individually and collectively, did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various factors.
Rather, the Board of Directors based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual
members of the Board of Directors may have given different weights to different factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is forward-looking in nature. This information should
be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 25 of this proxy statement.

McAfee Corp._20220104_DEFM14A_19754815_4361365.Pdf,Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,"Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated November 5, 2021, that, as
of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the
 
50Table of Contents
factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the $26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Snowlake
and their respective affiliates) of shares of Company Stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of
view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated November 5, 2021, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex D. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion
contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs provided
advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. The
Goldman Sachs opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company Stock should vote with respect to the merger,
or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:
 
 
•
 the Merger Agreement;
 
 
•
 McAfee’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020;
 
 
•
 McAfee’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein dated September 9, 2021, relating to the public
offering of shares of Class A Common Stock;
 
 
•
 certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of McAfee;
 
 
•
 certain other communications from McAfee to its stockholders;
 
 
•
 certain publicly available research analyst reports for McAfee; and
 
 
•
 certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for McAfee prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by McAfee,
which are referred to as the “Forecasts”.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of McAfee regarding their assessment of the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of McAfee; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Class A
Common Stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for McAfee with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the software industry; and performed such other
studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Board of Directors’ consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without
assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Board of Directors’ consent that the
Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of McAfee. Goldman
Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet
assets and liabilities) of McAfee or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs
assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained without
any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs’ analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed that the

McAfee; nor did it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of
view, as of the date of its opinion, to the holders (other than Parent, Snowlake and their respective affiliates) of shares of Company Stock, of the $26.00 in
cash per share of Company Stock to be paid to such holders, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does
not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other
agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the merger, including any payments (and
any waiver of rights to receive any such payments) under the Tax Receivable Agreement, dated October 21, 2020, by and among McAfee, Foundation
Technology Worldwide LLC (“OpCo”) and the other parties thereto, any distributions under the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability
Company Agreement of OpCo, dated as of October 21, 2020 (the “OpCo LLC Agreement”) and any exchange of units or redemption of units or shares of
Class B Common Stock pursuant to the OpCo LLC Agreement, the Contribution and Subscription Agreement by and among Snowlake, Parent and the
other parties thereto, dated as of November 5, 2021, any allocation of the aggregate consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company Stock
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including among the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the fairness of the transaction to,
or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of McAfee; nor
as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of McAfee, or class of
such persons, in connection with the merger, whether relative to the $26.00 in cash per share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Snowlake and
their respective affiliates) of shares of Company Stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion
did not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Class A Common Stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in
the credit, financial and stock markets on McAfee, Parent or the Merger, or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of McAfee or
Parent or the ability of McAfee or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on
economic, monetary market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its written opinion and
Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring
after the date of its written opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Board of
Directors in connection with its consideration of the merger and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of
Company Stock should vote with respect to such merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman
Sachs.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors in connection with rendering to
the Board of Directors the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial
analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by
Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with
the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before November 5, 2021, the last trading
day before the public announcement of the transaction, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Implied Premia and Multiples
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia and multiples described below based on the $26.00 in cash per share of Company
Stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Snowlake and their respective affiliates) of shares of Company Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.

Table of Contents
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock relative to:
 
 
•
 $21.21, the unaffected closing price for the Class A Common Stock on November 4, 2021, the last trading day prior to media reports
regarding a potential sale of McAfee (the “Current Share Price”);
 
 
•
 $21.78, the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Class A Common Stock over the 10-trading day time period ended November 4,
2021 (“10-day VWAP”);
 
 
•
 $21.59, the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock over the 20-trading day time period ended November 4, 2021 (“20-day VWAP”); and
 
 
•
 $21.74, the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock over the 30-trading day time period ended November 4, 2021 (“30-day VWAP”).
The results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:

In addition, Goldman Sachs calculated an implied equity value for McAfee for purposes of calculating the following multiples by multiplying the
$26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock by the total number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Company Stock as of November 4, 2021, as
provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of McAfee. Goldman Sachs then calculated an
implied enterprise value of McAfee by adding to the implied equity value it calculated the net debt of McAfee as of September 25, 2021, as provided by
the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of McAfee.
Using the foregoing, Goldman Sachs calculated the following implied multiples:
 
 
•
 the implied enterprise value for McAfee as a multiple of calendar years 2021 and 2022 revenues of McAfee, based on Institutional Brokers’
Estimate System (“IBES”) consensus estimates and as reflected in the Forecasts; and
 
 
•
 the implied enterprise value for McAfee as a multiple of the estimates of McAfee’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization (“EBITDA”) (including stranded costs related to divestitures but excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of
acquired intangibles and other one-time expenses) (“Adj. EBITDA”) for calendar years 2021 and 2022, based on IBES consensus estimates
and as reflected in the Forecasts.

Selected Public Company Comparables
Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for McAfee to corresponding financial and stock market
information for the following publicly traded corporations in the security software industry (collectively referred to as the “Selected Companies”):
 
 
•
 NortonLifeLock Inc. (“Norton”); and
 
 
•
 Avast PLC (“Avast”).
Although neither of the Selected Companies is directly comparable to McAfee, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly
traded companies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of McAfee.
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared next-twelve month (“NTM”) Adj. EBITDA multiples for McAfee and each of the selected companies,
based on financial and trading data as of November 4, 2021, information Goldman Sachs obtained from Capital IQ, publicly available historical data, market
data and IBES consensus estimates. NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples for McAfee were calculated based on the Forecasts and for Norton and Avast were
calculated based on IBES consensus estimates. Goldman Sachs calculated average NTM EV/Adj. EBITDA multiples over certain time periods prior to and
including November 4, 2021.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on McAfee to derive a range of illustrative present
values per share of Company Stock. Using discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting estimates of McAfee’s weighted average cost of capital,
and the mid-year convention, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of September 25, 2021 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow including
stock-based compensation (“UFCF”) for McAfee for the years 2021 through 2025 as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal
values for McAfee, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 2.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow
to be generated by McAfee, as provided by management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by management of McAfee (which analysis
implied exit terminal year NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples ranging from 8.4x to 12.7x). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the
Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s target capital structure weightings, the
 
54
Table of Contents
cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as
certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing
its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic
product and inflation.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for McAfee by adding the range of present values it derived as described above.
Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for McAfee the net debt of McAfee as of September 25, 2021, as
provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by management of McAfee, to derive a range of illustrative equity values
for McAfee. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of McAfee,
as provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by management of McAfee, using the treasury stock method, to derive
a range of illustrative present values per share of Company Stock ranging from $19.45 to $29.89.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of Company Stock, which is
designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company’s equity as a function of such company’s estimated
future Adj. EBITDA and assumed one-year forward enterprise value to Adj. EBITDA multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for
each of the fiscal years 2022 through 2024. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise values for McAfee as of December 31 for each of the
years 2021 to 2023 by applying enterprise value to NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples of 10.0x to 14.0x to NTM Adj. EBITDA estimates for each of the years
2022 to 2024 based on the Forecasts. These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and
experience, taking into account current and historical enterprise value to NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples for McAfee and current and historical enterprise
value to NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples for certain selected companies (as described above under “—Selected Public Company Comparables Analysis”).
Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of McAfee’s forecasted net debt as of December 31, 2021 to 2023, each as provided by the management
McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of McAfee, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for McAfee as of December
31 for each of the years 2021 to 2023. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the number of projected year-end fully diluted shares of Company Stock
for each of the years 2021 to 2023, as provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of McAfee, to
derive a range of implied future share prices. Goldman Sachs then discounted the December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2023 implied future share prices
back to September 25, 2021 using an illustrative discount rate of 8.5% to derive implied present values of future shares prices as of September 25, 2021.
Goldman Sachs then added to the implied present values of future shares prices the total present values, as of September 25, 2021, using an illustrative
discount rate of 8.5%, of forecasted dividends through each of the years 2021 to 2023, as provided by the management of McAfee and approved for
Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of McAfee. The illustrative discount rate of 8.5% reflected an estimate of McAfee’s cost of equity. Goldman
Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Price Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for
the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present
values of $17.80 to $31.01 per share of Company Stock.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions in the software industry since 2015.
For each of the selected transactions where information was publicly available, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied EV/ NTM EBITDA of
the applicable target company based on the total consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target company’s NTM EBITDA based on IBES
estimates at the time each such selected transaction was announced.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ analyses of the various transactions and its professional judgment and
experience, Goldman Sachs selected a reference range of EV/NTM EBITDA multiples of 11.1x to 19.0x and applied such range to McAfee’s NTM Adj.
EBITDA as reflected in the Forecasts, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for McAfee. Goldman Sachs then subtracted net debt for McAfee as
of September 25, 2021, as provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of McAfee, from the range
of implied enterprise values to determine a range of implied equity values for McAfee. Goldman Sachs then divided these equity values by the number of
fully diluted outstanding shares of Company Stock, as provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
management of McAfee, using the treasury stock method. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of Company Stock of
$19.89 to $37.26.

Premia Paid Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition transactions announced
from 2012 through November 4, 2021, involving a public company based in the United States as the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the
transaction was greater than $1 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 20th percentile
and 80th percentile premia of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the
transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 29.5% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 20th percentile premium of 15.7% and
80th percentile premium of 54.1% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 15.7% to 54.1%
to the unaffected closing price per share of Company Stock of $21.21 as of November 4, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of
Company Stock of $24.54 to $32.68.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to McAfee or the contemplated merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Board of Directors as to the fairness from a
financial point of view of the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Snowlake and their respective affiliates) of shares of
Company Stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject
to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of McAfee, Parent,
Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between McAfee and Parent and was approved by the Board of
Directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to McAfee during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific merger
consideration to McAfee or the Board of Directors or that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors
in making its determination to approve the transaction. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed
by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached
as Annex D.

substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated November 5 , 2021, McAfee engaged Goldman Sachs to
act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. The engagement letter between McAfee and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of
approximately $35 million, plus a discretionary fee of up to approximately $7 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction. In
addition, McAfee has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify
Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Summary of Projections
Except for a financial outlook with respect to the current fiscal quarter and year issued in connection with its ordinary course earnings
announcements, McAfee does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other results
due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying assumptions, estimates and projections, especially over the longer term periods. As a result,
McAfee does not endorse unaudited prospective financial information as a reliable indication of future results. However, McAfee is including a summary
of: (1) certain previously nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information prepared by its management for the fiscal years 2021-2024 (the “May 29
Projections”); and (2) certain previously nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information prepared by its management for the fiscal years 2021-
2025 (the “Management Projections” and, together with the May 29 Projections, the “Projections”).
The May 29 Projections were made available to the Board of Directors and also made available to Parent and Merger Subsidiary at Parent’s request
in connection with their due diligence review, as well as to certain bidders. The May 29 Projections were not approved by the Board of Directors, were not
provided to or made available to or used by Goldman Sachs for the purpose of performing financial analyses in connection with the rendering of its
opinion to the Board of Directors, were prepared prior to the divestiture of Enterprise and prior to the preparation of the Management Projections, and
were based on assumptions that may now be outdated.
The Management Projections were made available to, and approved by, the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and
the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Management Projections were also made available to Parent and Merger Subsidiary at Parent’s request in
connection with their due diligence review, and the Management Projections were made available to and used by Goldman Sachs with the approval of
McAfee management for the purpose of performing financial analyses in connection with the rendering of its opinion to the Board of Directors.

Notes:
 
(1)
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as adjusted operating income less depreciation expense plus certain other
non-operating costs. Adjusted operating income is defined as net income (loss), excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, equity-
based compensation expense, interest expense, foreign exchange (gain) loss, net, taxes, and certain other operating and non-operating costs.
Adjusted EBITDA for the May 29 Projections also excludes expenses related to being a publicly traded company.
(2)
Goldman Sachs arithmetically calculated the line item entitled “Unlevered Free Cash Flow” based on the information provided in the Management
Projections. “Unlevered Free Cash Flow” is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities plus
interest payments less capital expenditures. For purposes of the Management Projections made available to and used by Goldman Sachs with the
approval of McAfee management for the purpose of performing financial analyses in connection with the rendering of its opinion to the Board of
Directors, Unlevered Free Cash Flow was presented less stock-based compensation.
Important Information Regarding the Projections
The Projections were developed by McAfee management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement to be completed. Although the Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables
and assumptions made by McAfee management with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial
conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to McAfee’s business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and
many of which are beyond McAfee’s control. The Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from the results forecasted in the Projections, including, but not limited to, McAfee’s performance, industry
performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse changes in applicable laws,
regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various risks set forth in McAfee’s reports filed with the SEC.
There can be no assurance that the Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the Projections. The
Projections cover several years, and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Projections will be
affected by McAfee’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Projections reflect assumptions as to
certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information
should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that McAfee, Goldman Sachs, their respective
officers, directors, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives or anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable
prediction of future results, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be
regarded as an indication that the Projections will be necessarily predictive of actual future results. No representation is made or has been made by
McAfee or its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, representatives or any other person regarding the Projections or McAfee’s ultimate performance
compared to such information. The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
 
61
Table of Contents
information about McAfee contained in McAfee’s public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.” In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections, stockholders are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Projections.
The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the published guidelines of the SEC
regarding projections or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), or the guidelines established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. Neither McAfee’s independent auditor nor any other independent
accountant has compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form
of assurance on such information or its achievability.
Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA contained in the Management Projections summarized above are each a “non-GAAP financial
measure,” which is a financial performance measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the
Management Projections were relied upon by Goldman Sachs with the approval of McAfee management for purposes of its opinion and by the Board of
Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure
to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as
the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not
relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion or by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly,
McAfee has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with
GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by McAfee may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore,
there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP
presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Projections are included in this proxy statement not to influence any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger,
including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares of McAfee common stock. The Management Projections are included in this
proxy statement solely to give stockholders access to the nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information that was made available to, and
approved by, the Board of Directors, and made available to Goldman Sachs, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, in connection with their respective evaluations
of Merger. The May 29 Projections are included in this proxy statement solely to give stockholders access to nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial
information that was made available to provided potential purchasers in connection with a potential transaction involving the Company. The Projections
were based on estimates, assumptions and judgments made by McAfee management at the time of their preparation and speak only as of such times.
Except as required by applicable securities laws, McAfee does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to reflect circumstances existing
after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in
error.
Important Information Regarding the Management Projections
The prospective financial information (“management projections”) included in this document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of,
McAfee’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to
the accompanying management projections and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance
with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this document relates to McAfee’s previously issued financial
statements. It does not extend to the management projections and should not be read to do so.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards
In connection with the Merger, the equity awards held by McAfee’s executive officers and directors will be treated as described above. In addition,
McAfee has entered into certain arrangements with its executive officers and directors relating to their equity awards, as described below.
Each of the Management Incentive Unit, Company RSU and Company PSU award agreements with Peter Leav and Venkat Bhamidipati provide that
in the event of a change in control, such as the Merger, vesting of Peter Leav’s and Venkat Bhamidipati’s awards will accelerate in full (and, in the case of
Company PSUs, will be deemed earned based on the greater of target performance and actual performance of McAfee and/or OpCo, LLC, as applicable,
through the date of the change in control (or an earlier date selected for administrative convenience)) as of immediately prior to the change in control,
provided that Peter Leav or Venkat Bhamidipati, as applicable, remains employed through the date of the change in control.
Gagandeep Singh’s offer letter provides that if he remains employed through the date of a change of control, such as the Merger, that occurs within
twelve (12) months of his start date, 25% of his Company RSUs will vest as of immediately prior to such change in control.
In connection with McAfee’s initial public offering (or, with respect to Gagandeep Singh, his commencement of employment with McAfee),
McAfee entered into change in control severance agreements (the “Severance Agreements”) with our executive officers (other than Peter Leav). Pursuant
to the terms of the Severance Agreements, if an executive officer’s employment is terminated without cause (as defined in the Severance Agreement), or
the executive officer terminates the executive officer’s employment with McAfee for good reason (as defined in the Severance Agreement), in either case,
during the period beginning three (3) months prior to, and ending 18 months following, the consummation of a change in control, such as the Merger (a
“Qualifying Termination”), all of the executive officer’s unvested time-based equity awards will accelerate and vest in full as of the date of the executive
officer’s termination of employment and all performance-based equity awards granted following McAfee’s initial public offering will vest as of the
separation date based on the higher of target performance and actual performance through the date of termination of employment, as applicable, in
accordance with the documents governing such performance-based equity award.
Additionally, the Company RSU award agreements with each of McAfee’s non-employee directors provide that in the event of a change in control,
such as the Merger, all then-outstanding Company RSUs subject to the award will accelerate and vest in full immediately prior to such change in control.
The following table sets forth, as of December 14, 2021, for each of McAfee’s executive officers and directors, the number of unvested
Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC, unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs, and the estimated consideration that each such holder would
be entitled to receive in respect of such unvested Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC and unvested Company Awards in connection with the
Merger, assuming that the price per share of the Company Stock is $26.00, which equals the Per Share Consideration, and for Company PSUs eligible to
be earned based on our 2021 fiscal year performance, based on 130% of the target number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSUs,
and for Company PSUs eligible to to be earned based on our performance for our 2022 fiscal year or 2023 fiscal year, based on the target number of shares
of Company Stock subject to awards of Company PSUs.

Peter Leav Employment Agreement
McAfee has entered into an employment agreement with Peter Leav, which provides for severance benefits if his employment is terminated in
certain circumstances and provides for certain change in control benefits.
Under the terms of Peter Leav’s employment agreement, if McAfee terminates Peter Leav’s employment without cause (as defined in the
employment agreement) or if Peter Leav resigns for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement), in either case, within two years following a
change in control, Peter Leav would be entitled to (i) two times the sum of his then-current annual base salary and target bonus opportunity, payable over
a 24-month period; (ii) any earned but unpaid annual bonus related to the completed fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which termination of
employment occurs, payable in accordance with regular payroll practices; (iii) an annual bonus for the year in which the termination date occurs, with
payment based on actual performance during the year of termination, pro-rated to reflect the number of days during the bonus year in which Peter Leav
was employed by McAfee, payable in accordance with regular payroll practices; and (iv) provided that Peter Leav timely elects to receive continuation
coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (“COBRA”), a COBRA subsidy that, on an after-tax basis, is equal to the
employer-paid portion of the premium equivalent for active employees who elect the same type of medical, dental and vision coverage during the 24-
month period that follows Peter Leav’s termination of employment (or, if earlier, the time at which Peter Leav becomes eligible for group health coverage
from another employer), payable on a monthly basis during such period.
For an estimate of the value of the severance payments described above that would be payable to Peter Leav upon a qualifying termination on
December 14, 2021, see “—Quantification of Payments and Benefits to McAfee’s Executive Officers” below.
Executive Severance Agreements
Pursuant to the terms of the Severance Agreements, if an executive officer (other than Peter Leav) experiences a Qualifying Termination, the
executive officer is entitled to receive severance in an amount equal to the sum of (i) one and one-half (1.5) times the sum of the executive officer’s then-
current base salary and target

Table of Contents
annual bonus opportunity, payable in a lump sum, (ii) a prorated annual bonus, based on actual performance for the year in which the termination occurs,
payable at the time McAfee typically pays annual bonuses to senior executives of McAfee and its affiliates generally, (iii) if the executive officer elects
continuation coverage under our health plan, a monthly amount equal to the employer portion of the monthly premiums paid under McAfee’s group
health plans (as of the date of the executive officer’s termination of employment) for up to 18 months, and (iv) full acceleration of unvested time-based
equity awards and full acceleration of performance-based equity awards granted after the initial public offering based on the greater of target performance
and actual performance through the termination date.
In addition, if the severance payments and benefits provided under any employment agreement, offer letter, or prior severance agreement with an
executive, as applicable, is greater than the payments and benefits payable under the executive’s Severance Agreement, the executive will continue to be
entitled to the excess payments and benefits.
For an estimate of the value of the severance payments described above that would be payable to the executive officers upon a Qualifying
Termination on December 14, 2021, see “—Quantification of Payments and Benefits to McAfee’s Executive Officers” below.
Letter Agreement with Ashish Agarwal
Under Ashish Agarwal’s letter agreement with McAfee, Ashish is entitled to a change-in-control bonus equal to $250,000 if Ashish remains
employed as of the date of the Merger.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, McAfee’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification from
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and coverage for a period of six (6) years following the effective time under directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section captioned “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to McAfee’s Named Executive Officers
The table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of McAfee’s named executive officers would receive in connection with
the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such named executive officer experienced a Qualifying Termination on December
14, 2021 (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure); (ii) a per share price of the Company Stock of
$26.00; (iii) that each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus opportunity remain unchanged from those in effect as of the date
of this proxy statement; and (iv) none of the named executive officers’ equity awards that are outstanding as of December 14, 2021 vest or are forfeited,
and none of the named executive officers are granted additional equity awards, in each case prior to the date of the executive’s termination. In addition,
these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional awards, grants, or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective Time or any awards that, by
their terms, vest irrespective of the Merger prior to December 14, 2021. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or
be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by an
executive officer may differ materially from the amounts set forth below.
For purposes of this discussion, “single-trigger” refers to benefits that arise as a result of the completion of the Merger and “double -trigger” refers
to benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger and a qualifying termination.

Financing of the Merger",72,76
McAfee Corp._20220104_DEFM14A_19754815_4361365.Pdf,Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses
required to be paid at the Closing by Parent and Merger Subsidiary under the Merger Agreement, will be approximately $14 billion. This amount includes
funds needed to: (1) pay Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock (other than Excluded Shares and certain Company Restricted Shares), (2)
make payments in respect of our vested and outstanding Company Awards payable in connection with the Closing, and (3) make payments of all
indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement (collectively, the “Required Amounts”).
TopCo, Parent and Merger Subsidiary have obtained committed financing consisting of (i) equity to be provided by the Equity Financing Sources
pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters, (ii) debt financing to be provided pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter by the lenders party
thereto and (iii) preferred equity financing to be provided pursuant to the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter. In connection with the Merger Agreement,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary have delivered to McAfee copies of the Commitment Letters. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters) by or to
Parent or any of its affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Subsidiary under the Merger
Agreement.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Equity Financing Sources have committed to
capitalize Parent at the Closing with an aggregate equity contribution equal to $5.2 billion for the purpose of funding the Required Amounts. The
obligations of each Equity Financing Source to provide the equity financing under the Equity Commitment Letters are subject to a number of conditions,
including, but not limited to: (i) satisfaction in full, or waiver by Parent in writing of each the conditions to the obligations of Parent to consummate the
transactions set forth in Sections 9.01 and 9.02 of the
 
67Table of Contents
Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing of the Merger; provided, that those other
conditions are satisfied or waived at the Closing), (ii) the substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement, and (iii) the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing (or any alternative thereto in accordance with the Merger Agreement), if applicable, (A)
has been funded or (B) would be funded if the Closing were to occur. We refer to the equity financing described in the preceding sentence as the “Equity
Financing.”
The obligation of the Equity Financing Sources to fund the equity commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon the earliest to
occur of: (i) the consummation of the closing of the Merger, (ii) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (iii) the full
satisfaction of any final judgment against Parent in any action that includes an award of damages or the payment of any amount due in connection with
the Fee Funding Agreements, (iv) the commencement by McAfee of any lawsuit or other legal processing asserting any claim against any Equity
Financing Source or any of the Investor Parties (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letters) under, in respect of, or relating to, the Merger Agreement,
the Fee Funding Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) or the Equity Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated
thereby, subject to certain exceptions for permitted claims, and (v) each Equity Financing Source contributing to Parent cash in immediately available
funds in an aggregate amount equal to its equity commitment set forth in the applicable Equity Commitment Letter. As used in this proxy statement, the
term “Confidentiality Agreement” means collectively, (i) that certain letter agreement between Advent and McAfee dated February 5, 2021, (ii) that certain
letter agreement between Crosspoint Capital Partners L.P. and McAfee dated June 3, 2021, (iii) that certain letter agreement between Permira and McAfee
dated May 23, 2021 and (iv) that certain letter agreement between Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and McAfee dated June 2, 2021.
McAfee is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters solely with respect to enforcing Parent’s right to cause the
commitments under the Equity Commitment Letters by each Equity Financing Source to be funded to Parent in accordance with the Equity Commitment
Letters, and to cause Parent to enforce its rights against each Equity Financing Source to perform its funding obligations under the applicable Equity
Commitment Letter, in each case subject to (i) the limitations and conditions set forth in each applicable Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Debt Financing
The Debt Commitment Letter provides that the lenders party thereto will provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, in the aggregate up to $9.98 billion in debt financing (not all of which is expected to be drawn at the closing of the Merger), consisting
of the following:
 
 
•
 $6.66 billion senior secured first lien term loan facility;
 
 
•
 $1 billion senior secured first lien revolving credit facility; and
 
 
•
 $2.32 billion senior unsecured bridge facility (which may be replaced with senior notes issued through a Rule 144A or other private
placement).
We refer to the debt financing described above as the “Debt Financing.” The proceeds of the Debt Financing will be used (i) to effect the Merger
and related transactions on the Closing Date, (ii) for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and (iii) to pay fees and
expenses related to the Merger and related transactions.
The obligations of the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter to provide the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to
a number of customary conditions, including, but not limited to (as applicable):
 
 
•
 the absence of a Material Adverse Effect since November 5, 2021;
 
68

•
 the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any amendment or waiver that would
be materially adverse to the interests of the lenders in their capacity as such without the consent of the commitment parties);

 subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the accuracy in all material respects as of the closing of the Merger of certain specified
representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and certain specified representations and warranties in the loan documents;
 
 
•
 the Equity Financing shall have occurred or, substantially concurrently with the initial funding of the Debt Financing, shall occur; and
 
 
•
 solely with respect to the senior unsecured bridge facility, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
provide a marketing period (the “Debt Commitment Letter Marketing Period”) of at least 12 consecutive business days (subject to certain
blackout dates) following receipt of certain required financial information regarding McAfee.
As of the date hereof, definitive documentation governing the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter has not been finalized
and, accordingly, the actual terms of the Debt Financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.
Preferred Equity Financing
The Preferred Equity Commitment Letter provides that the purchasers party thereto will provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, in the aggregate up to $800 million in preferred equity financing.
We refer to the preferred equity financing described above as the “Preferred Equity Financing”, and together with the Debt Financing, the
“Debt/Preferred Equity Financing”. The proceeds of the Preferred Equity Financing will be used (i) to effect the Merger and related transactions on the
Closing Date, (ii) for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and (iii) to pay fees and expenses related to the Merger
and related transactions.
The obligations of the purchasers party to the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter to provide the Preferred Equity Financing under the Preferred
Equity Commitment Letter are subject to a number of customary conditions, including, but not limited to (as applicable):
 
 
•
 the absence of a Material Adverse Effect since November 5, 2021;
 
 
•
 the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any amendment or waiver that would
be materially adverse to the interests of the lenders in their capacity as such without the consent of the commitment parties);
 
 
•
 subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the accuracy in all material respects as of the closing of the Merger of certain specified
representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and certain specified representations and warranties in the loan documents; and
 
 
•
 the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing shall have occurred or, substantially concurrently with the initial funding of the Preferred
Equity Financing, shall occur.
As of the date hereof, definitive documentation governing the Preferred Equity Financing contemplated by the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter
has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the Preferred Equity Financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.
Fee Funding Agreements
Pursuant to the Fee Funding Agreements, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, each Fee Funding Source has agreed to guarantee
a portion of the payment of: (1) the aggregate amount of the Parent

Table of Contents
Termination Fee (as defined under the caption “The Merger—Termination Fee”) solely if and when payable by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
(2) certain enforcement expenses solely if and when payable by Parent in connection with certain legal proceedings and defaults under the Merger
Agreement; and (3) certain reimbursement obligations solely if and when payable by Parent pursuant to the indemnification obligations to McAfee and
its representatives in connection with the Debt Financing. We refer to the obligations set forth in the preceding sentence as the “Guaranteed
Obligations.” The obligations of the Fee Funding Sources under the respective Fee Funding Agreements are subject to an aggregate cap equal to
$600,030,000.
Subject to specified exceptions, each of the Fee Funding Agreements will terminate automatically and immediately upon the earliest of:
 
 
•
 the closing of the Merger, if the closing of the Merger occurs, and all amounts owed by Parent at the closing of the Merger pursuant to the
Merger Agreement are duly paid; and
 
 
•

The closing of the Merger will take place at 7:00 a.m., California time, as soon as possible, but in any event no later than the third (3rd) business day
after the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the Merger (as described under the caption, “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions; provided that if a specified marketing period (being the first period of fifteen (15) business days following the
later of (i) the date on which Parent has been provided the required financial information regarding McAfee required by the Debt Commitment Letter and
(ii) the date on which certain closing conditions set forth in Merger Agreement are satisfied, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger
Agreement) has not ended as of such date, the closing of the Merger shall instead occur on the earlier of (i) a date during the marketing period specified
by Parent in writing to McAfee on no fewer than two (2) business days’ notice and (ii) the third (3rd) business day immediately following the last day of
the marketing period, in each case, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions to closing of the Merger, other than conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions.
Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, McAfee Stockholders who continuously hold shares of Company Stock through the Effective Time, who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares, and who otherwise comply with the statutory
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”) will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not
constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that McAfee Stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section
262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder,” “holder of shares of Company Stock” or “McAfee Stockholder” are to the
record holder of shares of Company Stock unless otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of Company Stock is entitled to
demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Company Stock held of record in the
name of another person, such as a bank, broker, fiduciary (such as a trustee, guardian or custodian), depositary or other nominee, must act promptly to
cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of
Company Stock through a bank, broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your
bank, broker or the other nominee.
 
70Table of Contents
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of shares of Company Stock who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of their shares;
(ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (iii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time; and
(iv) otherwise exactly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Company Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. However, after
an appraisal petition has been filed, Section 262 provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all McAfee
Stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected
exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Company Stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (b) the value of the aggregate
Per Share Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million
(conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the “ownership thresholds”). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for
good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any time before the
Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to each McAfee Stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment
only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court
of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is
under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, such as the Special Meeting, the corporation, not
less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to
shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement
constitutes McAfee’s notice to McAfee Stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex E. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of Company Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review this discussion and Annex E carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the
requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A McAfee Stockholder who loses
his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the
complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Company Stock, McAfee believes that if a McAfee Stockholder
considers exercising such rights, that McAfee Stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
McAfee Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Company Stock must do ALL of the following:
 
 
•
 the McAfee Stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
 
 
•
 the McAfee Stockholder must deliver to McAfee a written demand for appraisal before the vote by the McAfee Stockholders on the Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting;
 
 
•
 the McAfee Stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Company Stock from the date of making the demand through the Effective
Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time); and
 
 
•
 the McAfee Stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Company Stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must
 
71
Table of Contents
 
file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective
Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds articulated in Section 262(g) must be met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a
McAfee Stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain
or not vote the shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of Company Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to McAfee, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to McAfee Stockholders, a written demand for
the appraisal of the McAfee Stockholder’s shares, and that McAfee Stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement. A holder of shares of Company Stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal
is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions
will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the McAfee Stockholder’s appraisal
rights. Therefore, a McAfee Stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to
vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting, or otherwise fail to vote, on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither
voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will,
in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition
to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not
constitute a demand. A McAfee Stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote of McAfee Stockholders on the adoption
of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of Company Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand
for appraisal in respect of shares of Company Stock must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform McAfee of the
identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the Merger. If the shares
are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf
of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be
executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint owners, may execute a demand
for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the
demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
MCAFEE STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO
WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF
THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A
BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY
MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept
the Per Share Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to McAfee a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time shall require written approval of the Surviving
Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any McAfee Stockholder without the approval of the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however,
that this provision shall not affect the right of any McAfee Stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a
named party to withdraw such McAfee Stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the Per Share Consideration within 60 days after the Effective
Time.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of shares of Company Stock
who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of Company Stock who has complied
with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of shares of Company Stock held
either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a McAfee Stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting McAfee Stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and McAfee Stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition
or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Company Stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Company Stock who
desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Company Stock
within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Company Stock to file such a petition within the period specified in
Section 262 could nullify the McAfee Stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
 
73
Table of Contents
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Company Stock who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and who is
entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares of Company Stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which McAfee has
received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail such statement to the
requesting McAfee Stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days
after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of Company Stock held either in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving
Corporation the statement described in the two previous sentences. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a McAfee
Stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Company Stock or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is served upon the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all McAfee Stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that
notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the McAfee Stockholders shown on
such verified list at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of
general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs of
these notices are borne by the Surviving Corporation. After notice to McAfee Stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is
empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those McAfee Stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the McAfee Stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to
submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any McAfee
Stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that McAfee Stockholder from the proceedings. The
Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all McAfee Stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless one of the ownership
thresholds is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of Company Stock entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds described above has been
satisfied as to McAfee Stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine the “fair value” of the shares of Company Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any
voluntary cash payments made by the surviving corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 that have the effect of limiting the sum on which
interest accrues as described below). In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court
in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the
period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment
in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each McAfee Stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such
interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of
the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid
at such time.

In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light
on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation.
In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or
susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
McAfee Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not
an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair
value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and McAfee Stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a
determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Consideration. Neither McAfee nor Parent anticipates offering more than the
Per Share Consideration to any McAfee Stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of McAfee and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary
cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a
share of Company Stock is less than the Per Share Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds
described above has been satisfied as to McAfee Stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the
appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a McAfee Stockholder,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a McAfee Stockholder in connection with an appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the
shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any McAfee Stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Company Stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or
successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the McAfee Stockholder’s shares of Company Stock will be deemed to have been converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Consideration, without interest. A McAfee Stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or
withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds
described above is met or if the McAfee Stockholder properly delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for
appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no McAfee Stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of Company
Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s
shares of Company Stock, if any, payable to McAfee Stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither
of the ownership thresholds described above is met, or if the McAfee Stockholder delivers to the
 
75
Table of Contents
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time
or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such McAfee Stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition
for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any McAfee Stockholder
without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not affect the right of any McAfee Stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such McAfee Stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a McAfee Stockholder’s statutory appraisal
rights. Consequently, any McAfee Stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise
those rights.

The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders
and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of Class A Common Stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to
the Merger. This discussion is limited to McAfee Stockholders who hold their shares of Class A Common Stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any
time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in
this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax
considerations described in this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed below.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to McAfee Stockholders subject to special
rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example, but not limited to:
 
 
•
 banks and other financial institutions;
 
 
•
 mutual funds;
 
 
•
 insurance companies;
 
 
•
 brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
 
 
•
 dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of Class A Common Stock (by vote
or value);
 
 
•
 regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
 
 
•
 retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;
 
 
•
 tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations and pension funds;
 
76Table of Contents
 
•
 holders that are holding shares of Class A Common Stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction or
conversion transaction or similar transactions;
 
 
•
 U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
 
 
•
 Partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S corporations,” or any other pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities);
 
 
•
 expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code;
 
 
•
 holders that are required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an
“applicable financial statement”;
 
 
•
 persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
 
 
•
 U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 
 
•
 except as noted below, holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent or more of Class A Common
Stock (by vote or value);
 
 
•
 grantor trusts;
 
 
•
 controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax;
 
 
•
 holders that received their shares of Class A Common Stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax qualified retirement plan or
pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
 
 
•
 holders that own a direct or indirect equity interest in Parent following the Merger;
 
 
•
 holders that hold their Class A Common Stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or
resident outside the United States; and
 
 
•
 holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and that properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as estate, gift or other
non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or foreign income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any
considerations arising under the Medicare contribution tax or any considerations in respect of any withholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account
Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection
therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement). This summary does not describe any tax
consequences relating to the Exchange and Redemption.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a
beneficial owner of shares of Class A Common Stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the
status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in
partnerships holding shares of Class A Common Stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR MCAFEE
STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX
ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.

Table of Contents
U.S. Holders
This section applies to “U.S. Holders.” For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Class A Common
Stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 
 
•
 an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
 
•
 a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 
 
•
 an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 
 
•
 a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one (1) or more
“United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust
validly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Class A Common Stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Class A Common Stock. A U.S. Holder’s gain or loss on the
disposition of shares of Class A Common Stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain
or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the completion of the Merger. A preferential tax rate on
capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations. U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Class A Common Stock (shares of Class A Common Stock purchased or acquired on
different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisor to determine how the above rules apply to them.
Non-U.S. Holders
This section applies to “Non-U.S. Holders.” For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Class A Common
Stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in
respect of gain recognized in connection with the Merger, unless:
 
 
•
 the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in
which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S.
Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income
tax treaty);
 
 
•
 such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition of shares of
Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S.
source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder, provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to
such losses; or
 
 
•
 shares of Class A Common Stock constitute a United States real property interest (a “USRPI”) by reason of the Company’s status as a
“United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“USRPHC”) at any time during the shorter of the
five- year period preceding the
 
78
Table of Contents
 
effective date of the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of Class A Common Stock (the
“Relevant Period”) and, if shares of our common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of our common stock at any
time during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.
persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC
if the fair market value of its USRPIs equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus
its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, USRPIs generally include land, improvements and associated
personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any
time during the five-year period preceding the Merger. Non-U.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the
possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders or Non-U.S. Holders in connection with
the Merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless
the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct
taxpayer identification number and certifying that such holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise
complies with the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding of tax may also apply to the proceeds received by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the
Merger, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form
W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such Non-U.S. Holder’s status as a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable
certification requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder or Non-U.S. Holder generally
will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS BASED ON CURRENT LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL CHANGES OR
INTERPRETATIONS, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET FORTH THEREIN.
THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY
WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR
THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION AND HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS
REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES.

General
McAfee and Parent have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to comply with all
applicable regulatory notification requirements, and, subject to certain limitations, to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions
 
79Table of Contents
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals include approval under the HSR Act, CFIUS Approval, the submission to DDTC of any
required notifications under Section 122.4(b) of ITAR, and certain other applicable antitrust and foreign direct investment laws (whether domestic or
foreign).
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until McAfee and Parent each files a Notification and
Report Form with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the applicable waiting
period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting
period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification and report forms. If the FTC or DOJ issues a request for additional information
and documents (which we refer to as the “Second Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day
waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is
terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.
McAfee and Parent each filed a Notification and Report Form with respect to the Merger with the FTC and DOJ on November 19, 2021. The
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired on December 20, 2021.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the
FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We
cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Other Regulatory Approvals
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties receive CFIUS Approval. McAfee and Parent submitted the Draft
CFIUS Notice to CFIUS with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on December 1, 2021. CFIUS
provided comments to the Draft CFIUS Notice on December 13, 2021, and McAfee and Parent submitted a final joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on December 23, 2021.
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until at least 60 days have elapsed since McAfee submitted the notification to the
DDTC pursuant to Section 122.4(b) of ITAR. McAfee submitted the notification to DDTC on November 20, 2021.
Additionally, the Merger is also subject to the filing or submission of, or obtaining of, certain necessary notices, clearances, approvals, waivers or
consents by the antitrust and other regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including the Anti-Monopoly Law of China 2007 and SAMR Interim
Provisions on the Review of Concentration of Undertakings of 2020 (The People’s Republic of China), Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 on the
control of concentrations between undertakings (European Union), Swiss Federal Act on Cartels and Other Restrictions of Competition of 1995, as

attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire
Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger
Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by
this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. 
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (i) were made only for
purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (ii) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (iii) may be
subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by McAfee, Parent and Merger Subsidiary in connection with
negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the
purpose of allocating contractual risk among McAfee, Parent and Merger Subsidiary rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to
standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. McAfee Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries
under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of, acts or condition of McAfee, Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective affiliates or businesses.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In
addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of McAfee, Parent and

Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger
Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide

Closing and Effective Time
The Closing will take place at 7:00 a.m., California time, as soon as possible, but in any event no later than the third (3rd) business day following the

time of the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the Merger (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger), the
closing of the Merger will then occur on the date that is the earlier of (i) any day during such marketing period specified by Parent to McAfee on no less
than two (2) business days’ notice to McAfee and (ii) the third (3rd) business day immediately following the final day of such marketing period, in each
case subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the Merger (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the closing of the
Merger).
On the Closing Date, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL.
The time at which the Merger will become effective will occur at the Effective Time.
Merger Consideration
Company Stock
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action required by any McAfee Stockholder or any other person, each share of
Company Stock (including, for the avoidance of doubt, each share of Class A Common Stock resulting from the exchange of vested Management
Incentive Units, Class A Units and Class B Common Stock for Class A Common Stock in accordance with the OpCo LLC Agreement) (other than
Company Restricted Shares that will be converted into Cash Awards and Excluded Shares, which include, for example, shares of Company Stock owned
by McAfee Stockholders who have properly and validly exercised and not withdrawn their statutory rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL)
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and extinguished, and automatically converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time:
 
 
•
 Each in-the-money Company Stock Option that is outstanding and vested (including each Company Stock Option that accelerates and
becomes vested by its terms in connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive, without interest, an
amount in cash determined by multiplying the excess of the Per Share Consideration over the exercise price of the Company Stock Option
by the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each option to purchase
Company Stock that is not in-the-money (whether or not vested) shall be canceled for no consideration.
 
 
•
 Each Company RSU and Company PSU that is outstanding and vested as of the Effective Time (including each Company RSU and each
Company PSU that accelerates and becomes vested by its terms in connection with the Merger) will be canceled and converted into the
right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to the number of shares of Company Stock subject to the vested Company RSU
or Company PSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share Consideration.
 
 
•
 Each Company Cash Right will be assumed, honored, or continued in accordance with its terms.
 
83
Table of Contents
 
•
 Each Company Award that is then outstanding and not vested (other than options to purchase Company Stock that are not in-the-money)
will be converted into a Cash Award, which will remain subject to the same time vesting terms and conditions that apply immediately prior to
the Effective Time, will be paid out on the next payroll date following the applicable vesting date, so long as the applicable portion becomes
vested prior to the applicable holder’s termination of service. Each Cash Award will be subject to vesting, payment and other conditions
that are no less favorable to each such holder than those that applied to the corresponding Company Award immediately prior to the
consummation of the Merger. Each Cash Award will provide each applicable holder with the opportunity to be paid an amount in cash equal
to:
 
 
•
 with respect to each Cash Award deriving from an in-the-money Company Stock Option that is not vested, (i) the excess of the Per
Share Consideration over the option exercise price of such in-the-money Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to such in-the-money Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the closing; and
 
 
•
 with respect to each Company Award deriving from a Company Restricted Share, Company RSU, or Company PSU that is not vested
(i) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Restricted Shares, Company RSU, or Company PSU as of
immediately prior to the closing multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Consideration; provided, that (A) in the case of a Company PSU that is
not vested and that has an applicable one-year performance period that ends on or ended prior to the closing, for purposes of
determining the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU to be converted into a Cash Award, such
Company PSU shall be deemed earned based on the actual performance of McAfee during such performance period, and (B) in the
case of a Company PSU that is not vested and that has an applicable one-year performance period that ends after the closing, for
purposes of determining the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU to be converted into a Cash Award,
the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU shall be determined as though such performance conditions
were satisfied at the applicable target levels.
Following the execution of the Merger Agreement, McAfee and the purchasing parties further agreed that, in connection with the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and generally subject to an applicable individual’s continued employment or other service to
McAfee and its affiliates through the time that is immediately prior to the closing (except as described below), the following Special Vesting Opportunity
will apply effective as of immediately prior to the closing:
 
 
•
 each individual whose employment or other service to the Company and its affiliates commenced prior to January 1, 2021 will become vested
in an additional number of then outstanding unvested Company Awards having an aggregate dollar value (determined based on the amount
payable in respect of such outstanding Company Awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement and without regard to vesting conditions)
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) 25% of the combined total value associated with such individual’s then-outstanding unvested Company
Awards (other than any Company Awards granted after the execution of the Merger Agreement) and then outstanding unvested
Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC over (ii) the total value associated with such individual’s then-outstanding unvested Company
Awards and then-outstanding unvested Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC, in each case, that will vest or otherwise accelerate by
their terms or the terms of the Merger Agreement in connection with the consummation of the Merger; and
 
 
•
 each individual whose employment or other service to the Company and its affiliates commenced on or after January 1, 2021 but before
November 1, 2021 will become vested in an additional number of then-outstanding unvested Company Awards (determined based on the
amount payable in respect of such outstanding Company Awards implied by the Merger Agreement and without regard to vesting
conditions) equal to the excess, if any, of (i) 12.5% of the combined total value associated with such individual’s then-outstanding unvested
Company Awards (other than any Company Awards granted after the execution of the Merger Agreement) over (ii) the total value
associated with such individual’s
 
84
Table of Contents
 
then-outstanding unvested Company Awards that will otherwise accelerate by their terms or the terms of the Merger Agreement in
connection with the consummation of the Merger.
The Special Vesting Opportunity will not apply with respect to any employee or other service provider that remains employed by, or is providing
services to, McAfee or any of its affiliates as of immediately prior to the Closing if, as of the time of the Closing, the service provider’s employment or
other service is scheduled to transfer to an affiliate of the buyer of McAfee’s Enterprise business unit (i.e., because of a delayed transfer of subsidiaries
in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions) pursuant to the divestiture transaction that closed on July 27, 2021. To the extent that any Company Awards vest
pursuant to the dollar value of the Special Vesting Opportunity, (i) the dollar value of the applicable holder’s Cash Awards received in exchange for
Company Awards that do not vest in connection with the Closing Date will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the dollar value of the Special
Vesting Opportunity to such employee or other service provider, with the offset being applied in reverse chronological order (i.e., starting with the
amount payable on the latest vesting date after the Closing Date and, to the extent necessary, proceeding to the next latest vesting date, etc.), (ii) such
vesting will be deemed to take place immediately prior to the Closing for all purposes of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) such Company Awards so
impacted by the Special Vesting Opportunity will become vested pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of immediately prior to the Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Company Awards will vest and accelerate with respect to the Special Vesting Opportunity if the holder would have already
become vested as of the Closing in respect of at least 25% or 12.5%, as applicable, of the combined total dollar value of his or her then-outstanding
unvested Company Awards (other than any Company Awards granted after the execution of the Merger Agreement) and then-outstanding unvested
Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC pursuant to the terms thereof or the terms of the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contemplates that McAfee may request Parent’s consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) to the vesting of Company Awards held by current or former employees and service providers prior to the Effective Time that would
otherwise not vest in accordance with their terms or the Special Vesting Opportunity described above.
Treatment of Vested Management Incentive Units and Class A Units
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors shall take all actions so that all Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC shall be
vested in full and (i) McAfee will require each holder of vested Management Incentive Units, each holder of Class A Units of OpCo LLC and each holder
of Class B Common Stock to effect the Exchange and Redemption and (ii) each share of Class B Common Stock, if any, will automatically be canceled
immediately upon the consummation of the Exchange and Redemption, such that no shares of Class B Common Stock remain outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.
Exchange and Payment Procedures",91,94
McAfee Corp._20220104_DEFM14A_19754815_4361365.Pdf,Exchange and Payment Procedures,"Exchange and Payment Procedures
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a U.S. bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to McAfee (the “Paying Agent”), and enter into
a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent for the purpose of acting as agent in exchanging for the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
(A) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the “Certificates”) or (B) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”). At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Stock (other than Excluded Shares and certain Company Restricted Shares that will be converted into
Cash Awards) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Promptly following the Effective Time (and in no event later than two (2) business days after the Effective Time), McAfee will send, or will cause the
Paying Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Stock (other than certain Company Restricted Shares that will be converted into
Cash Awards and Excluded Shares, which include, for example, shares of Company Stock owned by McAfee Stockholders who have
 
85Table of Contents
properly and validly exercised and not withdrawn their statutory rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL) (as of immediately following the
Exchange and Redemption and immediately prior to the Effective Time) a letter of transmittal in a form that was reasonably acceptable to McAfee and
instructions (which will specify that the delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or receipt
of an “agent’s message”, as applicable) for use in the exchange of such shares of Company Stock for such holder’s applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration; provided, that if any holder of record of shares of (x) Company Stock or (y) Class A Units and Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC
(together, the “OpCo Units”) requests in writing to McAfee (at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing) to receive such letter of transmittal and
instructions in advance of the Effective Time, McAfee will send, or will cause the Paying Agent to send, to each such requesting holder such letter of
transmittal and instructions. The amount of any Per Share Consideration paid to McAfee Stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding
taxes.
Upon receipt of the letter of transmittal properly completed by the applicable holder and the surrender of the certificate representing shares of
Company Stock to the Paying Agent or receipt of an ‘agent’s message’ by the Paying Agent or other evidence of transfer in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, the holder of such certificate or book-entry shares will be
entitled to receive the Per Share Consideration for each such share.
In the event that any certificate representing shares of Company Stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting
by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made with respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such certificate.
If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes or fees required as a result of such payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. Payment of the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the person in whose name such Uncertificated
Shares are registered as of immediately following the Exchange and Redemption and immediately prior to the Effective Time.
No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefits of any holders of Company Stock entitled to a portion of the Merger Consideration. Any portion
of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent for payment to the holders of shares of Company Stock that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company
Stock immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental authority shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

Each of the Paying Agent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and Parent are entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration and
any other payments otherwise payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any person such amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that any amounts are withheld and
properly paid to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts will be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and

Additionally, under certain specified circumstances, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by McAfee Stockholders, McAfee
may, among other things, provide non-public information relating to the McAfee Group to, and engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with,
a person in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach in any material respect of Section 6.03 of the
Merger Agreement (provided that McAfee and its representatives may contact any third party to clarify the terms and conditions of an Acquisition
Proposal or inform such person of the existence of the applicable provisions in the Merger Agreement) if (and only if), subject to complying with certain
procedures described in the subsequent paragraph, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, a
Superior Proposal.
Both during the Go Shop Period and after the No Shop Period Start Date but prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by McAfee
Stockholders, McAfee is not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal
unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith over a three (3)
business-day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, so that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a
“Superior Proposal” relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such negotiations.
If McAfee has complied in all material respects with Section 6.03(b) and (c) of the Merger Agreement and terminates the Merger Agreement prior to
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by McAfee Stockholders for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal, other
than entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal with an Excluded Party prior to the Cut-Off Date, McAfee must pay a $291,265,000

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that the holders of
shares of Company Stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors will not
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change except as described below.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by McAfee Stockholders, the Board of Directors may not take any action described in the following
(any such action, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”):
 
 
•
 fail to make, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to fail to make, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of Directors to the McAfee Stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement;
 
 
•
 adopt, approve, endorse or recommend (or propose publicly to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend) an Acquisition Proposal;
 
 
•
 fail to issue a press release publicly reaffirming the recommendation of the Board of Directors to approve the Merger within ten (10)
business days after Parent so requests or, if earlier, at least two (2) business days prior to the Special Meeting (which request may be made
once per Acquisition Proposal);
 
95Table of Contents
 
•
 fail to include the recommendation of the Board of Directors to approve the Merger Agreement in this proxy statement; or
 
 
•
 submit to McAfee Stockholders for approval or adoption any Acquisition Proposal.
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the following, in and of itself, will constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change: (i) the determination by the
Board of Directors that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) a public press release as to the determination described in prior
clause (i) so long as such press release also states that no Adverse Recommendation Change or termination of the Merger Agreement will occur until the
expiration of the three (3) business day (or, if applicable, the two (2) business day) period discussed below, subject to McAfee’s compliance with certain
other terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, or (iii) delivery by McAfee to Parent of any notice related to an Intervening Event (as defined in this
section of this proxy statement below) or Superior Proposal as set forth below.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by McAfee Stockholders, the Board of Directors
may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) there has been an Intervening Event; or (ii) McAfee has received a written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach in any material respect of Sections 6.03(b) or (c) of the Merger Agreement, whether before or after the No Shop Period
Start Date, that the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior
Proposal and, in each case of clause (i) and (ii), the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary obligations under Delaware law.
The Board of Directors may only effect an Adverse Recommendation Change for an Intervening Event if:
 
 
•
 McAfee has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three (3) business days in advance to the effect that the Board of Directors
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which notice must specify in reasonable detail
the facts of the underlying Intervening Event;
 
 
•
 prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, McAfee and its representatives, during such three (3)-business-day period,
must, if requested by Parent, have (i) engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend the Merger Agreement in such manner that
obviates the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) considered in good faith any revisions to the Merger Agreement or
any other Transaction Document irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent; and
 
 
•
 the Board of Directors (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) shall have determined in good faith that the
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law.
In addition, the Board of Directors may only effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize McAfee to terminate the Merger Agreement
to substantially concurrently enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:
 
 
•
 the McAfee Group and its representatives have complied in all material respects with its obligations under Sections 6.03(b) or (c) of the
Merger Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
 
 
•
 McAfee has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three (3) business days in advance to the effect that the Board of Directors has
(i) concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the applicable Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (ii) resolved to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate the Merger Agreement
absent any revision to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which notice will attach the most current version of the proposed
agreement under which the Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and include the identity of the third party making such
Acquisition Proposal;
 
96
Table of Contents
 
•
 prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or termination, the Board of Directors, during the three (3) business day notice
period described above, has: (i) negotiated with Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to so negotiate) to amend the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; (ii) considered
in good faith any revisions to the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Document irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent,
provided, however, that in the event of any material amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal,
McAfee will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this clause (it being understood
that the “notice period” in respect of such new written notice will be two (2) business days);
 
 
•
 following the three (3) business day notice period described above including any subsequent notice period as provided above, the Board of
Directors shall have determined that such Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal and the failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate the Merger Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to Delaware law, even if Parent’s proposed revisions were to be given effect; and
 
 
•
 in the event of any termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the foregoing in order to cause or permit the McAfee Group to enter
into an acquisition agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, McAfee will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of either (i)
$145,632,500 if the Merger Agreement is terminated before the Cut-Off Date for the purposes of entering into a definitive agreement in
respect of a Superior Proposal with any Excluded Party or its affiliates or (ii) $291,265,000, in the case of any other such termination.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means any material fact, event, change, development or
set of circumstances that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable to, the Board of Directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement (or if known to
the Board of Directors as of the Merger Agreement, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of
the date of the Merger Agreement) and becomes known to the Board of Directors prior to the time that the McAfee Stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement; provided, however, that none of the following will constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt, existence of or terms of an Acquisition
Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof and (B) changes in the market price or trading volume of the shares of Company Stock or
the fact that McAfee meets or exceeds internal or published projections, budgets, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial results
for any period (provided, however, that the underlying causes of such change or fact shall not be excluded by this clause (B)).

employer, to the extent recognized under the comparable employee plans of McAfee and its subsidiaries) where length of service is relevant (but not
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans) shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their affiliates, provided
that such service need not be recognized to the extent it would result in any duplication of benefits or was not credited for the same purpose with respect
to such Company Employee under the analogous employee plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent will waive, and will cause the Surviving

McAfee Corp._20220104_DEFM14A_19754815_4361365.Pdf,Amendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement,"Amendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement
The following summary describes certain relevant provisions of the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the material provisions of the Amendment.
The descriptions of the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment, each of which is incorporated into this proxy
statement by reference. We encourage you to read the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment carefully and in their entirety because this
summary may not contain all the information about the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment that is important to you. The rights and
obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment and not by this summary or any
other information contained in this proxy statement. 
Concurrent with the initial public offering of shares of the Class A Common Stock and related reorganization transactions undertaken in connection
with the initial public offering of McAfee, McAfee entered into a tax receivable agreement with the TRA beneficiaries. McAfee acquired favorable tax
attributes as a result of the reorganization transactions. In addition, exchanges or redemptions of OpCo LLC units for cash or shares of Class A Common
Stock are expected to produce favorable tax attributes for McAfee. When McAfee acquires OpCo LLC units in connection with these exchanges or
redemptions, anticipated tax basis adjustments are likely to increase (for tax purposes) McAfee’s depreciation and amortization deductions, thereby
reducing the amount of income tax that McAfee would be required to pay in the future in the absence of this increased basis. This increased tax basis
may also decrease the gain (or increase the loss) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent that the tax basis is allocated to those assets. Under
the terms of the TRA, absent a change of control of McAfee, McAfee would generally be required to pay to the TRA beneficiaries 85% of the benefits, if
any, that McAfee is deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions) as a result of (i) all or a portion of McAfee’s allocable share of existing tax
basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) acquired in connection with the reorganization transactions undertaken in connection with
McAfee’s initial public offering, (ii) increases in McAfee’s allocable share of existing tax basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) and tax
basis
 
110Table of Contents
adjustments in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) as a result of sales or exchanges of OpCo LLC units after McAfee’s initial public offering,
(iii) certain tax attributes of the corporations McAfee acquired in connection with such reorganization transactions (including their allocable share of
existing tax basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries)), and (iv) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax
benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. The increases in McAfee’s allocable share of existing tax basis in OpCo LLC assets and tax basis
adjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions available to members of OpCo LLC and,
therefore, may reduce the amount of tax that McAfee would otherwise be required to pay in the future in respect of taxable income and gain allocated to
McAfee with respect to OpCo LLC units.
In addition, the TRA provides that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination or other changes of control with respect to
McAfee were to occur, then the TRA would terminate and McAfee’s obligations, or McAfee’s successor’s obligations, under the TRA would accelerate
and become due and payable. Absent the Amendment, the amount of such accelerated change of control payment obligations would have been
calculated as aggregate payment obligations under the TRA absent a change of control based on certain assumptions set forth in the TRA, including
(among others) the assumption that McAfee would have sufficient taxable income in each taxable year ending on or after the change of control to fully
utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the TRA. The Merger, upon closing, constitutes a change of control under the TRA that would
cause the payment obligations to accelerate and become due and payable.
On November 5, 2021, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, McAfee, OpCo LLC and certain of their respective affiliates
entered into the Amendment with certain other parties, in accordance with the terms of the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement. The Amendment (i)
amends the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement (as further described below) and (ii) provides for certain covenants regarding tax reporting and tax-related
actions after the closing of the Merger.
The Amendment provides for (i) the payment of amounts due under the TRA with respect to McAfee’s 2020 U.S. federal income tax year in
accordance with the terms of the TRA up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000, which payments shall be paid no later than 10 business days prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) the suspension of all other payments under the TRA from and after November 5, 2021 and (iii) the amendment of the TRA by inserting a
new Section 7.19 into the TRA effective as of immediately prior to and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time which will result in the TRA
(and all of McAfee’s payment obligations thereunder, including the obligation to make any of the foregoing suspended payments) terminating
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Amendment also includes agreements among the parties thereto regarding the preparation of tax returns for
tax periods that end on, before or include the Closing Date and limits actions that may be taken by McAfee, OpCo LLC and certain of their controlled
affiliates after the closing of the Merger to the extent such actions may have an effect on items reflected on such tax returns.
The Amendment also (i) suspends all tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement from and after November 5, 2021 for so long as the
Amendment is in effect, and (ii) provides that from and after the Effective Time, no person or entity shall have any obligation to make or pay tax
distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement.
In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Amendment shall become null and void ab initio and all
payments that were suspended under the TRA pursuant to the Amendment, and all tax distributions that were suspended under the OpCo LLC
Agreement pursuant to the Amendment, shall be made by McAfee and OpCo LLC as if the Amendment had never been executed.
The Amendment will result in (i) the suspension of certain payments under the TRA with respect to McAfee’s 2021 U.S. federal income tax year in
aggregate and (ii) contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement, a permanent elimination of certain payments under
the TRA that
 
111
Table of Contents
would have otherwise been payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA with respect to McAfee’s 2021 U.S. federal income tax year. The Amendment
will also eliminate any obligation of McAfee to make a payment under the TRA as a result of a change of control of McAfee, which would be substantial.
The Amendment also will result in (i) the suspension of certain tax distributions by OpCo LLC under the OpCo LLC Agreement with respect to McAfee’s
2021 and 2022 U.S. federal income tax years and (ii) contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement, a permanent
elimination of an obligation to make such tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement. Tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement are
intended to be sufficient to cover OpCo LLC members’ respective U.S. federal, state and local income tax liability (as determined in accordance with the
OpCo LLC Agreement). Such tax liability relates to the net amount of taxable income and gain allocated to such members for the relevant taxable period
(or as a result of any capital shifts or guaranteed payments for the use of capital) with respect to OpCo LLC units held by such members. The suspension
and/or elimination of tax distributions under the Amendment will reduce the outflow of cash from OpCo LLC to members of the OpCo LLC each quarter
during the period that the Amendment is in effect.
For more information with respect to the Amendment, please see our other filings with the SEC, including the section in our 2021 Proxy Statement
captioned “Amendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement” above and a copy of the Amendment which is included as Exhibit 99.2

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, McAfee is required to submit a proposal to McAfee
Stockholders to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to McAfee’s named executive officers
that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This compensation is
summarized in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of McAfee in the Merger.” The Board of Directors
encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly,
McAfee is asking you to approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the McAfee Stockholders approve, on a non-binding advisory basis the compensation that will or may become payable to
McAfee’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the
section captioned ‘The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of McAfee in the Merger.’”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly,
you may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the
vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on McAfee. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted and the Merger
is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this
Compensation Proposal.

Approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding shares of Company
Stock representing a majority of the outstanding shares present at the Special Meeting in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present. Assuming a
quorum is present, (i) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (ii)
abstentions will be treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have the same effect as a vote against the Compensation Proposal and (iii) broker “non-
votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Company Stock represented by properly executed, timely
received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a McAfee Stockholder returns a signed proxy card
without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Company Stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of
Directors.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If McAfee Stockholders approve the
adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit
additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from McAfee Stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against
adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be
defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those
shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a
quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

The following table sets forth information, as of the December 25, 2021, regarding ownership of our common stock by:
 
 
•
 each person or group of affiliated persons known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock;
 
 
•
 each of our directors;
 
 
•
 each of our named executive officers (each, an “NEO”); and
 
 
•
 all directors and executive officers as a group.
The amounts for our NEOs and executive officers and directors as a group and our significant stockholders are as of the December 25, 2021 unless
otherwise indicated in a footnote below (and in that case are based upon SEC filings made on behalf of such owners). Beneficial ownership in this table is
determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, the
number of shares of Company Stock deemed outstanding includes those shares issuable upon exercise of options held by the respective person or group
that may be exercised within 60 days after the December 25, 2021. For purposes of calculating each person’s or group’s percentage ownership, unvested
stock options exercisable within 60 days and all shares of restricted stock are included for that person or group, but not for any other person or group.
Percentage of beneficial ownership is based on the shares of common stock outstanding as of the December 25, 2021. Beneficial ownership representing
less than 1% is denoted with an asterisk (*).
Pursuant to the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into by the Company and certain of our stockholders in connection with our IPO (the
“Stockholders Agreement”), the TPG Funds (as defined below) have the right to appoint a majority of the directors serving on the Board. As a result, the
TPG Funds may be deemed to control the Company’s exercise of its option to settle exchanges of OpCo LLC Units into shares of Class A Common Stock
or cash with respect to any such exchange by the TPG Funds. As a result of this control, the TPG Funds beneficially own all shares of Class A common
stock underlying its OpCo LLC Units. Other than with respect to the TPG Funds, the beneficial ownership of Class A Common Stock in the table below
does not take into account the potential redemption and exchange of a stockholder’s OpCo LLC Units for Class A Common Stock and the corresponding
cancellation of an equivalent number of shares of Class B Common Stock. The TPG Funds’ beneficial ownership of Class A Common Stock in the table
below aggregates both its direct ownership of Class A Common Stock and the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which its OpCo LLC Units
could be converted. If this were to actually occur, all of the TPG Funds’ Class B Common Stock would be cancelled and its beneficial ownership
percentage of the Class B Common Stock would be 0%.

The OpCo LLC Units are exchangeable for cash or, at our option, shares of our Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. In these tables, other
than with respect to the TPG Funds, beneficial ownership of OpCo LLC Units has not been reflected as beneficial ownership of shares of our Class
A Common Stock for which such LLC Units may be exchanged. When an OpCo LLC Unit is exchanged for cash or, at our option, Class A Common
Stock by a stockholder who holds shares of Class B Common Stock, a corresponding share of Class B Common Stock will be cancelled.
Accordingly, in the first table above, the beneficial ownership percentage of Class A Common Stock provided with respect to the TPG Funds
reflects the combined voting power of the TPG Funds’ Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

Section 2.01. The Merger.
(a) On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Delaware Law, at the

Delaware as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.
(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place at the offices of Ropes & Gray LLP, 1900
University Avenue, 6th Floor, East Palo Alto, California 94303 at 7:00 a.m. California time, as soon as possible, but in any event no later than the third (3rd)
Business Day after the date all of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver by the appropriate party of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the
extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree; provided that if the Marketing Period has not ended as of such date, the Closing shall instead occur
on the earlier of (i) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent in writing to the Company on no fewer than two (2) Business Days’ notice and
(ii) the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the last day of the Marketing Period, in each case, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver by the appropriate party of those conditions at the Closing) (the date on which the Closing occurs, the “Closing Date”).
(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall cause a certificate of merger to be duly executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of Delaware Law and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware
Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the “Effective Time”) as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as the parties may agree in writing and specify in the certificate of merger).
(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 259 of Delaware Law.

Management Incentive Units, Class A Units and Class B Common Stock for Class A Common Stock in accordance with the OpCo LLC Agreement

converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash,
 
16
Table of Contents
without interest (the per share consideration, the “Per Share Consideration” and the aggregate consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each share shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section
2.03, without interest;
(ii) each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding and held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto;
(iii) each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding and held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger
Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and
(iv) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and, together with the
shares described in Section 2.02(a)(iii), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
(b) Within five (5) Business Days following the date of this Agreement the Company shall provide written notice (the “OpCo Redemption Notice”)
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to all of the Members (as defined in the OpCo LLC Agreement). Such OpCo Redemption Notice shall
include such information as may reasonably describe the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including this Section
2.02(b)), in accordance with Section 10.01 of the OpCo LLC Agreement. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, in accordance with Section 10.01 of the
OpCo LLC Agreement and the certificate of incorporation of the Company:
(i) the Company shall require each Member to effect an Exchange (as defined in the OpCo LLC Agreement) of all of such Member’s Vested
Management Incentive Units (if any) for New Class A Units (as defined in the OpCo LLC Agreement) in accordance with Section 10.01 and Section
9.02 of the OpCo LLC Agreement and, thereafter, shall require each Member to effect a Redemption (as defined in the OpCo LLC Agreement) of all
of such Member’s Class A Units (including, but not limited to, any New Class A Units) and Class B Common Stock in exchange for shares of Class
A Common Stock in accordance with Section 10.01 and the Redemption provisions of Article IX of the OpCo LLC Agreement (applied for this
purpose as if the Company had delivered an Election Notice (as defined in the OpCo LLC Agreement) that specified a Share Settlement (as defined
in the OpCo LLC Agreement) with respect to such exchanges), which Exchange and Redemption will be consummated by way of (A) first, an
automatic surrender of such Class A Units (including New Class A Units) not held by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to OpCo LLC; (B)
second, a contribution by the Company to a corporation that will be formed by the Company not more than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date
(“NewCo”) of a number of Shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the number of Class A Units surrendered to OpCo LLC as described in clause
(A) above; (C) third, a contribution by NewCo to OpCo LLC of such shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for the issuance by OpCo LLC
to NewCo of an equal number of Class A Units; and (D) fourth, a distribution to each member of OpCo LLC that surrendered any number of Class A
Units to OpCo LLC pursuant to Section 10.01 of the OpCo LLC Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby of a number of shares of
Class A Common Stock equal to the number of Class A Units so surrendered, in a transaction treated as a “disguised sale” of partnership interests
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes between such member and NewCo;
 
17
Table of Contents
(ii) the Company shall take such other actions as are reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the exchange and redemption described in
Section 2.02(b) (collectively, the “Exchange and Redemption”) in accordance with the OpCo LLC Agreement; and
(iii) each share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically be canceled immediately upon the consummation of the Exchange and
Redemption, such that no shares of Class B Common Stock remain outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all necessary and appropriate actions so that all Management Incentive
Units shall be Vested in full as of immediately prior to the Exchange and Redemption.
Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment.
(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”) and enter into a paying
agent agreement with the Paying Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purpose of acting as agent in exchanging for the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration (A) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the “Certificates”) or (B) uncertificated shares of Company
Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”). Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Company shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Stock (other than shares of Company Stock
to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i) or Section 2.02(a)(ii) and shares of Company Stock converted pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(iii)) as of
immediately following the Exchange and Redemption and immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal (in a form that was reasonably
acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time) and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or receipt of an “agent’s message”, as applicable) for use in the exchange of such shares of
Company Stock for such holder’s applicable portion of the Merger Consideration; provided, that if any holder of record of shares of Company Stock or
OpCo Units requests in writing to the Company (at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing) to receive such letter of transmittal and instructions
in advance of the Effective Time, the Company shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each such requesting holder such letter of
transmittal and instructions in advance of the Effective Time.
(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Per Share Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal in the case of
certificated shares of Company Stock, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Per Share Consideration in respect of each share
of Company Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal completed by a holder of Company Stock as of immediately following the Exchange and Redemption and
immediately prior to the Effective Time that has been converted into the right to receive the Per Share Consideration is received by the Paying Agent
(together with the surrender of a Certificate, if applicable) at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be paid out of the
Payment Fund (as defined below) the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder of Company Stock is entitled as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the occurrence of the Effective Time. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such applicable portion of the Merger Consideration.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Stock
entitled thereto, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding any amounts in respect of any Appraisal Shares)
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall, pending its disbursement to the holders of Company Stock
entitled thereto, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation in (i) short-term direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-
 
18
Table of Contents
term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, or (iv)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided that
no such investment or losses shall affect the amounts payable to such holders of Company Stock entitled thereto and Parent shall promptly replace or
cause to be replaced any funds deposited with the Paying Agent that are lost through any investment so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate unpaid Merger Consideration. Earnings from investments, subject to the
immediately preceding proviso, shall be paid to and shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and no interest will
be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holders of Company Stock entitled to a portion of the Merger Consideration. Except as contemplated by Section
2.03(e) hereof, the Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes or fees required as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.
Payment of the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares are registered as of immediately following the Exchange and Redemption and immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(d) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the portion of the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 2.
(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Stock entitled thereto one (1) year
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such former holder of shares of Company Stock who has not exchanged shares
of Company Stock for the Per Share Consideration to which they are entitled in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares of Company
Stock without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Section 2.04. Appraisal Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares of Company Stock canceled in accordance with Section 2.02(b)) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of
this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Delaware
Law (such shares being referred to collectively as the “Appraisal Shares” until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such holder’s appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Per Share Consideration
but instead shall be cancelled and the holders thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to payment of the appraised
value of such shares in accordance with Delaware Law; provided that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such holder’s right to appraisal
 
19
Table of Contents
pursuant to Delaware Law, such shares of Company Stock shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the

of Directors of the Company.

the following, in and of itself, shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change: (aa) the determination by the Board of Directors of the Company that
an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (bb) a public press release as to the determination described in prior clause (aa) so long as such
press release also states that no Adverse Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement shall occur until the expiration of the 3 Business

contact the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or inform such Person of the existence of the
provisions in this Section 6.03 or (II) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in
response to an Intervening Event, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make an Adverse
 
48
Table of Contents
Recommendation Change as a result of such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware
Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change (but shall not be permitted to take the actions referred to in
clause (2), (3) or (5) of the definition thereof which relate solely to Acquisition Proposals); provided, that, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
make any such Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company has (i) provided to Parent at least three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice
that it intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the facts of the underlying Intervening Event, (ii) during such three (3) Business
Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for
such Adverse Recommendation Change (provided that it is understood and agreed that the Board of Directors of the Company’s determination and
providing such notice solely to Parent in each case as permitted by the express terms of this Agreement shall not in itself constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change or a basis to terminate this Agreement) and (iii) shall have considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent.
(f) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations
required under Applicable Law or applicable rules of the NASDAQ, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9(g) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal (or any similar
communication to stockholders) or (ii) making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication to stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) or
(iii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware
Law (provided that this clause (iii) shall not permit the Company to take any action which would constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change, which
instead shall be governed by Section 6.03(c), Section 6.03(e) or Section 6.03(h)); provided, that with respect to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), any
such action taken or statement made, in and of itself, shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the
Company reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action.
(g) At any time after the No Shop Period Start Date and until the earlier of the valid termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than one day after (i) the end of the No Shop Period Start Date with respect to previously
received Acquisition Proposals or (ii) receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, as applicable), which notice shall identify the Third Party
making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal and the Company shall reasonably promptly inform Parent (but in no
event later than one day) after any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal and shall provide to Parent
promptly (but in no event later than one day after receipt thereof) copies of all proposed transaction agreements or proposal letters or other material
written agreements sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describe any material terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, making an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to Delaware Law,
(ii) the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have complied in all material respects with Sections 6.03(b) and (c) with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the Company promptly notifies Parent in writing, at least three (3) Business Days before taking such action, of
the determination of the Board of Directors of the Company that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and of its intention to take
such action, attaching the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such
 
49
Table of Contents
Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party making such Superior Proposal and (iv) the Board of Directors of
the Company (A) shall have, during such notice period, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent, to the extent Parent requests to negotiate, to
amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change or valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), (B) shall have considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document irrevocably
proposed in writing by Parent and (C) shall have determined that such Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal and the
failure to make an Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to Delaware Law, if such revisions were to be given effect (provided that it is understood and agreed that the determination of
the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with clause (i) and providing the notice required by clause (iii) shall not, in and of itself, constitute
an Adverse Recommendation Change or a basis to terminate this Agreement) (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company but only a new two (2)
Business Day period under this Section 6.03(h)). As used in this Agreement:
(i) “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party that contains provisions that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such confidentiality
agreement may contain a less restrictive or no standstill restriction.
(ii) “Intervening Event” means a material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances that was not known or reasonably
foreseeable to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof (or if known to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date
hereof, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof) and
becomes known to the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained; provided, however
that none of the following will constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been, an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt, existence
of or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof and (B) changes in the market price or trading volume
of the shares of Company Stock or the fact that the Company meets or exceeds internal or published projections, budgets, forecasts or estimates of
revenues, earnings or other financial results for any period (provided, however, that the underlying causes of such change or fact shall not be
excluded by this clause (B)).
(iii) “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock
(assuming the prior exchange of all OpCo Units for shares of Company Stock) or at least a majority of the consolidated assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that was not solicited in breach in any material respect of the terms of Sections 6.03(b) or (c) and that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all relevant terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including legal, regulatory, financing and closing conditions), is more favorable from a financial
perspective to the holders of the Company Stock than the Merger (taking into account any irrevocable written proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(h)).
(iv) “Excluded Party” means any Third Party (i) from whom the Company or any of its Representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the No Shop Period Start Date; and (ii) whose Acquisition Proposal the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to or
result in, a Superior Proposal. Any Third Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party under this Agreement with respect to a particular Acquisition
Proposal upon such time as such Acquisition Proposal made by such Third Party is withdrawn, cancelled, terminated or otherwise expires or the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) is no longer,
and no longer would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, a Superior Proposal.

Agreement, or (E) subject to, and without limiting, the requirements of Section 6.03, any information related to an Adverse Recommendation Change or
the actions of the Company’s Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) with respect thereto, (ii) any such investigation shall be conducted under
reasonable supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any unreasonable burden with respect to the prompt and timely discharge by
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize to the extent
reasonably practicable any disruption to the businesses of the Company that may result from any such requests for access and (iii) any access to the
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures, policies and insurance requirements and
will not include the right to sample soil, sediment, groundwater, surface water, air or building materials or conduct any other environmental sampling or

respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information that create an unreasonable burden on the
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries. In addition, the Company, its Subsidiaries and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to arrange for, as
reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company, communication strategies for, and joint meetings of the Company and Parent with, the Company’s
customers, suppliers, and employees; provided, that (y) such meetings do not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (z) a Representative of the Company must be present at all times during such meetings. The Company may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate commercially sensitive material provided to the other as “Outside Counsel Only Material” or with similar restrictions,
and such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction
indicates, and be subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, with the consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Company may satisfy its obligations set forth above by electronic
means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under Applicable Law (including as a result of COVID-19 Measures).

Subsidiaries therein and (B) customary executed management representation letters and CFO certificates with respect to the financial information included
in the Marketing Materials for bond offerings; (iv) causing the Company’s auditors to provide customary comfort letters (including “negative assurance”

including possessory collateral (it being understood that no such pledging of collateral will be effective until at or after the Closing), facilitating the
obtaining of guarantees, and assistance in the preparation of any definitive financing documents and other matters ancillary to the Debt Financing as
may be reasonably requested by Parent, including by providing information for the completion of any schedules or certificates thereto; (vi) at least four

pursuant to this Section 6.05: (A) that would require the Company or any of its Affiliates or any other Persons who are directors or officers of such
entities to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing that are not conditioned upon the
effectiveness of the Closing; provided that any director or officer whose resignation becomes effective immediately after the Closing occurs shall not be
required to pass resolutions or consents, (B) that would require

instrument or agreement, or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, opinion, document, instrument or agreement, in each case,
prior to the Closing (it being understood that no obligations of the Company under any certificate, opinion, document, instrument or agreement delivered
pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be required to be effective prior to the Closing), (C) that would cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement

Section 6.05, (G) that provides access to or discloses information that the Company or any of its Affiliates determines could reasonably be expected to
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of, or conflict with any confidentiality obligations contained in any Material Contracts not entered into in
contemplation of the obligations of the Company under this Section 6.05 binding on, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (H) that would, in the
opinion of the Company in good faith, unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of its or its Affiliates’ businesses or would require an action
that is not within the control of the Company or its Affiliates using reasonable best efforts or (I) that would cause significant competitive harm to the
Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement or pursuant to confidentiality undertakings customary for the type of Debt/Preferred Equity Financing contemplated under the Debt
Commitment Letter or Preferred Equity Commitment Letter. Nothing contained in this Section 6.05 or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its
Affiliates to encumber any of its assets or be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing or require the Company or
any of its Affiliates to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing, in each case, prior to the Closing. Parent shall,

6.05 represent the sole obligations of the Company and any of its Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any
financing (including the Financing) to be obtained by Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations. Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses actually suffered or incurred by them in connection with the provision of assistance pursuant to this Section 6.05 in connection
with the Financing or any other financing by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the arrangement thereof) and any information used in connection
therewith except any such losses, damages, claims costs or expenses arising out of any willful misconduct, gross negligence, or bad faith, fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries and its or their respective Representatives. The reimbursement and

hereby agrees, to do the following:
(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation under employment agreements or indemnification agreements and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto
now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a present or
former director, manager, officer, or fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an “Indemnified Person”) as provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, the Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Company, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement, employment agreement, or
other agreement containing any indemnification provisions, in each case which agreement has been delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof, between
such Indemnified Person and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect any right to indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses thereunder of any such Indemnified
Person.
(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (jointly and severally) shall indemnify and hold harmless all
Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law in the event of any threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (a “Claim”), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the
fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee), manager, officer or fiduciary with

permitted by Applicable Law upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such expenses if such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification under

Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification has
been sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Person from all liability arising out of such Claim, does not include any admission of wrongdoing on the part of such Indemnified Person, or such
Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with an Indemnified Person in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person seeks
indemnification hereunder.

Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing
directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and the Company’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time
(including claims with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company’s existing policies; provided that the Company
shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such “tail” insurance policy and the Company shall give good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto; and provided, that the premium payable for such “tail” insurance policy shall not
exceed 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year and if the cost for such “tail” insurance policy exceeds such maximum
amount, then the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such maximum
amount.
(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its property and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the applicable successor, assign or transferee shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.03 (including this Section 7.03(d)).
(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law, under any agreement of any Indemnified Person
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.03 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person.
(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.03.
Section 7.04. Employee Matters.
(a) With respect to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (“Company Employees”), for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing (or, if earlier, until the termination of the
applicable Company Employee’s employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide (i) base salary or wage rates, severance and target annual and quarterly cash bonus opportunities to such Company Employee
that, in each case, is not less favorable than the base salary or wage rates, severance and target annual and quarterly cash bonus opportunities provided
to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (or, if more favorable to such Company Employee, the compensation and benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates) and (ii) other employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those
employee benefits that such Company Employee was entitled to receive immediately prior to the Closing (in each case without regard to any retention,
change in control, stay, transaction, or similar non-routine compensation or compensation opportunities, or equity or equity-based compensation);
provided, however, that in all events the compensation, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment provided by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall (x) be no less than those required under Applicable Law, and (y) comply with the terms of the Business Sale Agreement and applicable
Local Transfer Agreements.
 
55
Table of Contents
(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.04(a), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
assume, honor and continue (i) during the twelve-month period following the Effective Time or, if sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been
satisfied, all of the Company’s employment, severance, bonus, incentive compensation, commission, change in control, retention and termination plans
and agreements, in each case in effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event) and (ii) all obligations under the Cash Awards and the
Company Cash Rights, in each case, without any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply with
Applicable Law or with the written consent of the applicable Company Employee.
(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, including any vacation,
paid time-off and severance plans (the “Parent Plans”), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of or entitlement to benefits,
benefit accruals, early retirement subsidies and vesting, each Company Employee’s service where length of service is relevant (but not, for the avoidance
of doubt, benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the such predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or such Subsidiary under the comparable Employee Plans) shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
Affiliates, as applicable; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits or was not credited for the same purpose with respect to such Company Employee under the analogous Employee Plan immediately prior to
the Effective Time.
(d) Parent shall waive, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to waive, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or similar limitations, under any Parent Plans in which any Company Employee (or
the dependents of any eligible employee) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time. Parent shall recognize or credit, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to recognize or credit, any deductible, co-insurance, maximum out of pocket expenses or other payments
incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) under any applicable Employee Plan during the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible, co-payment limitations and out-of-pocket maximums under the relevant welfare benefit
plans, including the Parent Plans and Employee Plans, in which such Company Employee will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.
(e) Upon the request of the Company, Parent shall provide all information reasonably requested by the Company and in sufficient time to enable the
Company and its Subsidiaries to meet any notification, information and consultation requirements, pursuant to any collective bargaining or similar
agreement and Applicable Laws, and the parties agree to work together in good faith to consult with, or obtain the consent or advice of, any labor union,
labor organization or other employee representative body as commercially practicable or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.
(f) The Company will take all actions necessary to (i) cancel all outstanding participant elections under the Company’s ESPP with respect to the
planned first offering period, which is scheduled to begin on November 16, 2021, (ii) cause such offering period not to commence, and to cause no other
offering period to commence, and (iii) terminate the Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time; provided that if it is not administratively practicable for the
Company to cancel all outstanding participant elections and prevent the offering period that is scheduled to begin on November 16, 2021 from
commencing, the Company shall take all actions that may be necessary or required under the Company ESPP and applicable Laws to discontinue such
offering period as soon as administratively practicable after it commences (but in all events prior to the Effective Time) and to return all amounts credited
to participant accounts under the Company ESPP as soon as administratively practicable thereafter to the applicable participant or his or her applicable
beneficiary.

Company, Parent, Surviving Corporation, or any of their Subsidiaries for any period of time or preclude the ability to terminate the employment of any
Company Employee for any reason. After the Effective Time, notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 7.04, nothing contained in this Section 7.04 is
intended to be or shall be considered to be an amendment or adoption of any plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy of the Parent or Surviving
Corporation nor shall it interfere with the Parent’s, or any of its Subsidiaries’ right to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan or to terminate the
employment of any employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries for any reason.
Section 7.05. Financing.
(a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the proceeds of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date on the
terms and conditions and in the amounts described in the Commitment Letters (including any “flex” provisions) or such other terms and conditions that
are more favorable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, including (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters and any Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements (as defined below) and complying with its obligations thereunder, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis, taking into consideration the timing of the
Closing and the completion of the Marketing Period, and in a manner that will not impede the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger
promptly upon the Closing Date, all conditions to the funding of the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt/Preferred
Equity Financing Agreements that are within its control, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to negotiate and enter into definitive debt or preferred
financing agreements on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable
(including any “flex” provisions) or such other terms and conditions that are more favorable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary (the “Definitive
Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Agreements”), (iv) if the conditions under the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, as
applicable, are satisfied, consummating the applicable Debt/Preferred Equity Financing and causing the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Sources to
consummate their respective Financing at the Closing, (v) complying with its obligations under the Commitment Letters and Definitive Debt/Preferred
Equity Financing Agreements in a timely and diligent manner, taking into consideration the timing of the Closing and the completion of the Marketing
Period and (vi) keeping the Company informed on a regular and current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters and any other financing (including, by, upon reasonable request of the Company, promptly providing to the
Company drafts of material definitive agreements for the Financing (and any amendments thereto entered into on or prior to the Closing) and giving the
Company prompt notice of (i) any fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material and
adverse impact on the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters, (ii) any breach by any party to the Commitment Letters or Definitive
Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Agreements of which Parent has become aware, (iii) the expiration or termination (or attempted or purported termination,
whether or not valid) of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, (iv) any written or electronic (including email) notice or
communication by any Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Source with respect to any actual or threatened breach, default (or allegation thereof),
repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Agreement or any refusal to provide, or stated
intent that it will not provide, by any Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Source the full amount of the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter for any reason, (v) Parent’s good faith belief, for any reason, that it may no longer be
able to obtain all or any portion of any Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions described therein (after giving
effect to any flex provisions), or (vi) receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any person with respect to any: (A) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Debt/
 
57
Table of Contents
Preferred Equity Financing Agreement, (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
Definitive Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Agreement (other than ordinary course negotiations) and (C) the failure of any condition to the Debt/Preferred
Equity Financing to be satisfied. Any breach of the Commitment Letters, the Financing agreements, any Alternative Financing commitment or any
Definitive Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Agreements by Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall be deemed a breach by Parent of this Section 7.05.
(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Commitment Letters or Definitive Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Agreements
without Parent’s prior written consent; provided that Parent may, without the Company’s prior written consent: (i) enter into any amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or any Definitive
Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Agreements that would not, and would not reasonably be expected to, (A) reduce the amount of the Debt/Preferred
Equity Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, to an amount that will be less than the
Required Amount, (B) adversely affect the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to enforce its rights against any other party to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, in each case, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, in each case, in
accordance with this Agreement, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect
on the date hereof, (C) prevent, materially delay or impede the consummation of the Merger, the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the applicable Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Equity
Commitment Letter, or (D) impose any new or additional conditions, or otherwise expand any of the conditions, to the availability and funding of
Debt/Preferred Equity Financing as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable, and (ii) amend,
replace, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book
runners, syndication agents, purchasers or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Equity Commitment Letter as
of the date of this Agreement. Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver, the terms “Debt Commitment Letter”,
“Preferred Commitment Letter”, “Definitive Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Agreement”, as applicable, shall mean the Debt Commitment Letter, Preferred
Equity Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Agreement, as applicable, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified.
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt Commitment
Letter or Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and/or any such waiver of a provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Equity Commitment Letter.
(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing or Preferred Equity Financing, as applicable, becomes unavailable, or the Debt Commitment Letter or
any of the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded, regardless of the reason therefor, then Parent
shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable, from the same and/or alternative debt or preferred equity financing
sources, as applicable, alternative financing in an amount, together with the amount of Financing remaining available and cash and cash equivalent on
hand at the Company and its Subsidiaries, sufficient to pay the Required Amount on the Closing Date, in each case, upon terms and conditions not
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any related “market flex” provisions) (“Alternative Financing”) and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor; provided that such reasonable best efforts shall not require Parent to pay more fees, OIDs or incur an increase in
pricing than the pricing terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, taking into account any flex terms. In the event any Alternative Financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 7.05(c), references in
this Agreement to “Debt Financing”, “Preferred Equity Financing” or “Debt/Preferred Equity Financing”, as applicable, shall also be deemed to refer to
such Alternative Financing, as appropriate, and if one or more
 
58
Table of Contents
commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing,
references in this Agreement to the “Debt Commitment Letter”, “Preferred Equity Commitment Letter” and the “Definitive Debt/Preferred Equity
Financing Agreements”, as applicable, shall also be deemed to refer to such commitment letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such
Alternative Financing, as appropriate, and all obligations of Parent pursuant to this Section 7.05 and all obligations of the Company pursuant to Section
6.05 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as Parent’s obligations with respect to the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing.
(d) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing or any Alternative Financing, nor

authority of any jurisdiction, CFIUS or any other Governmental Authority (collectively, “Regulatory Authority”) in connection with any Regulatory Law
and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets; by consenting to such action by the
Company and provided, that any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger) (each a
“Divestiture Action”) solely to ensure (x) that no Regulatory Authority enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or
permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of
the Merger and (y) that no Regulatory Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Merger, fails to do
so by the End Date. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted by a Regulatory Authority challenging the Merger as violative of any
Regulatory Law, Parent shall take all action necessary, including but not limited to any Divestiture Action, to avoid or resolve such action. In the event
that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
for the avoidance of doubt, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates prior to the Closing shall be required to take any action set forth
in Section 8.01(c) or Section 8.01(d) (which is not conditioned on the Closing) to satisfy the efforts standard set forth in this Section 8.01 (or elsewhere in

agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a controlling portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner), any
Person or portion thereof which competes, in any material respect, in the consumer cybersecurity industry, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets which compete, in any material respect, in the consumer cybersecurity industry or (2) assign any of its rights hereunder to any Person or permit
any Person to acquire a direct or indirect interest in Parent, in each case, if the entering into an agreement to consummate, or the consummation of, such
acquisition, merger or consolidation or assignment would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk
of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other approvals of any Regulatory Authority necessary to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 9.01(c),
Section 9.01(d) or Section 9.01(e), (ii) increase the risk of any Regulatory Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby which would prevent the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 9.01(b), or (iii) increase the risk of not being able to
remove any Restraint. For purposes of this Section 8.01(f), with respect to the controlled Affiliates of the Persons listed on Section 8.01(f)-1, “control”

and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be

Equity Financing Sources party to the Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable.
(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.
Section 11.04. Expenses.
(a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11.04 and the Reimbursement Obligations under Section 6.05(b), all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.
(b) Company Termination Fee.
(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i), then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to
Parent in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days after such termination. “Company Termination Fee” means (i) solely if payable
by the Company in connection with a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) prior to the Cut-Off Date to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for the consummation of a Superior Proposal made by an Excluded Party or its Affiliates, which Superior Proposal was made
prior to the Cut-Off Date, an amount equal to $145,632,500, and (ii) if payable by the Company in any other circumstance, an amount equal to
$291,265,000.
(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay the Company Termination
Fee to Parent in immediately available funds substantially concurrently with such termination.
(iii) If (A) after the date of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly made to the Company or shall have
been publicly made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly disclosed (and, in any such
case, such Acquisition Proposal is not publicly withdrawn at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting), (B)
thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
 
69
Table of Contents
Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii), and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company consummates or enters into a
definitive agreement providing for the consummation of, an Acquisition Proposal that is subsequently consummated (whether or not within such
twelve (12) month period), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date of
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of Section 11.04(b), all references to “20%” and “80%” in the definition of “Acquisition
Proposal” shall be deemed to be references to “50%”.
(c) Parent Termination Fee. If this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(ii) (or by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(i) at a time when the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(ii)) or (y) by the Company
pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(iii) (or by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) at a time when the Company would have been entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(iii)), then, in any such case, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company an amount equal to
$582,530,000 (the “Parent Termination Fee”) not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following such termination.
(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary would not enter into this
Agreement and (iii) each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 11.04 and, in order to obtain such payment, either Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for the payment of any amount set forth in this Section 11.04,
such paying party shall pay the other party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the annual rate of the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by Applicable Law (collectively, the
“Enforcement Expenses”); provided that in no event shall either party be obligated to pay more than $12,500,000 in Enforcement Expenses.
(e) Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is
payable by the Company pursuant to this Section 11.04 and such Company Termination Fee is paid in full, except for the Enforcement Expenses, (i) Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, Sponsors, or any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members,
equityholders or Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives (collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”) shall be precluded from any other
remedy against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise relating to, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) none of Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives (collectively, the
“Company Related Parties”) relating to, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) Parent’s right to
receive payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.04 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties
for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and (iv) upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to, arising out
 
70
Table of Contents
of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
(f) The Company agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable by Parent
pursuant to this Section 11.04 and such Parent Termination Fee is paid in full, except for the Enforcement Expenses and Reimbursement Obligations, (i) the
Company Related Parties shall be precluded from any other remedy against the Parent, at law or in equity or otherwise relating to, arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the Company shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgement or damages
of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Parent Related Parties or any of the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing
Entities relating to, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (iii) the Company’s right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.04 shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties or any of the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Entities for all losses and
damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and (iv) upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, none of the Parent Related Parties or any of the Debt/Preferred Equity
Financing Entities shall have any further liability or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties relating to, arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly
agreed that (i) nothing in this Section 11.04 shall impair the Company’s or Parent’s right to seek specific performance prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement solely to the extent permitted under Section 11.13, (ii) the parties to the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain obligated for, and the Company
shall be entitled to remedies with respect to, breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement, (iii) nothing in this Section 11.04 shall limit or otherwise affect
Sponsors’ obligations under the Fee Funding Agreements or prior to the valid termination of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters, (iv)
following a termination of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall remain liable hereunder, and each Sponsor shall remain liable under the
applicable Fee Funding Agreement to which it is a party, for the Parent Termination Fee, any Enforcement Expenses or the Reimbursement Obligations
that become due and payable until paid, and (v) following a termination of this Agreement, the Company shall remain liable hereunder for the Company
Termination Fee and any Enforcement Expenses that become due and payable until paid. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance prior to the termination of this Agreement, and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if applicable, under
Section 11.04, following a termination of this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance to cause the Closing to occur and monetary damages or all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.
Section 11.05. Disclosure Letter References. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto agree that any reference in a
particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other provisions hereof of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of
this Agreement, and any other representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other provisions hereof of such party that is contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements and other provisions hereof, would be reasonably apparent based solely on the face of such disclosure. The Company Disclosure Letter is
incorporated by reference into and made a part of this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision hereof shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception
or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any

acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company, as applicable, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other parties (as applicable), and to specific
performance by the other parties (as applicable) of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other parties (as applicable) under this Agreement, without proof of actual harm or the
inadequacy of a legal remedy and without bond or other security being required. The pursuit of specific enforcement or other equitable remedies by any
party will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether at law or in equity) to which such
party may be entitled at any time, subject to the limitations on remedies set forth in this Agreement.

Table of Contents
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that, prior to the Closing, the Company shall
be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity Financing and to cause Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 2.01, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement, if and only if, (i) all conditions in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied if Closing were on such date), (ii) the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing (or, if
Alternative Financing is being used in accordance with Section 7.06(c), the financing to be made available pursuant to the commitments with respect
thereto) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (iii) Parent has failed to consummate the
Closing at the time when it was required under Section 2.01, and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific
performance were granted and the Financing were funded, then the Closing would occur in accordance with Section 2.01.
(c) Subject to the limitations on remedies set forth in this Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise at any time of any other remedy.
(d) The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on the other hand, hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance in accordance with and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, under this Agreement on the basis that (i) there is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity. The parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 11.13, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the
Fee Funding Agreements, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 11.13 shall require any party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party’s right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 11.13 prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article 10,
nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.13 or anything set forth in this Section 11.13 restrict or limit any party’s
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 10 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement, the Commitment Letters
or the Fee Funding Agreements that may be available then or thereafter (subject the terms and conditions set forth herein and therein); provided that the
parties acknowledge and agree that, while the Company may pursue a grant of specific performance prior to the termination of this Agreement, following
a termination of this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to seek a grant of specific performance to cause the
Closing to occur; provided that the Company may continue any ongoing Action for specific performance filed prior to a purported termination of this
Agreement.
Section 11.14. Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Sources Provisions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries: (a) agrees that any Action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, involving the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Entities, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt/Preferred Equity
Financing or any of the agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter) entered into in connection with the
Debt/Preferred Equity Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any agreements thereunder shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains
available, and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such Action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees that any such Action shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the Applicable Laws of another state), except as otherwise provided in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or other applicable

definitive document relating to the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing, (c) agrees that service of process upon the Company or its Subsidiaries in any such

defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court, (e) waives to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law trial
by jury in any Action brought against the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Entity in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the
Debt/Preferred Equity Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance of any agreements thereunder, (f) agrees that none of the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Entities will have any liability to the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
agreement thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise and (g) agrees that in no event will Company Related Party
be entitled to specific performance of any commitment letter or similar agreement entered into by Parent or Merger Sub for any Debt/Preferred Equity
Financing against the Debt/Preferred Equity Financing Entities providing such Debt/Preferred Equity Financing. The Debt/Preferred Equity Financing

filing a consolidated federal income tax return with the Corporation, the “Corporate Group”), the Corporate Subsidiaries, Foundation Technology
Worldwide, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “LLC”), McAfee Finance 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Finance LLC”),
McAfee, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“McAfee LLC” and, together with the Corporation, the Corporate Subsidiaries, the LLC, Finance LLC
and McAfee LLC, the “McAfee Parties”), each of the TPG Nominee, the Intel Nominee, the TB Nominee and the GIC TRA Party and the other Persons
that execute this agreement (collectively, the “Parties”).
RECITALS
WHEREAS, the Parties and certain other Persons are parties to that certain Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of October 21, 2020 (together with
the annexes thereto, as amended, the “TRA”);
WHEREAS, simultaneously with the entry into this Amendment, the Corporation, Condor BidCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and
Condor Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Subsidiary”) are entering into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 5, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which the Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Corporation with the
Corporation surviving (“Merger”);
WHEREAS, the Parties wish to amend (i) the TRA as set forth in this Amendment to provide for, among other things, (x) the payment of amounts
due under the TRA to each Person entitled to payments under the TRA (each such Person, a “TRA Payee”) with respect to the U.S. Federal income tax
year 2020 of the Corporation in accordance with the terms of the TRA and this Amendment notwithstanding the closing of the transactions under the
Merger Agreement and (y) the termination of all payment obligations under the TRA (other than the 2020 TRA Payments) upon the effectiveness of the
Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and (ii) the LLC Agreement as set forth in this Amendment;
WHEREAS, the Board has reviewed this Amendment and determined that it is in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders to enter
into this Amendment and to perform its obligations contemplated hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof and to cause the amendment of the TRA
and the LLC Agreement as set forth herein;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual agreements and covenants hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally
bound, the Parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Definitions; References. Unless otherwise specified herein, each capitalized term used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in the TRA. To the extent there is a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Amendment and the terms of any
of the TRA or the LLC Agreement (in each case, prior to giving effect to this Amendment), this Amendment shall control and shall constitute an
amendment of the TRA and/or the LLC Agreement, as applicable, to the extent of such conflict.
 
1Table of Contents
2. TRA Payments.
(a) 2020 TRA Payments. The Corporation shall make the payments required to be paid to the TRA Payees pursuant to the terms of the TRA with
respect to the 2020 taxable year of the Corporation (the “2020 TRA Payments”) pursuant to the TRA upon the earlier of (i) the date that such payments
would be made in the ordinary course by the Corporation and (ii) ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (as that term is defined in the Merger
Agreement) in accordance with the terms, conditions, methodologies and procedures set forth in the TRA (in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), prior to
giving effect to this Amendment and, for the avoidance of doubt, without taking into account the closing of the transactions under the Merger
Agreement or the termination of all other payment obligations under the TRA); provided, that the 2020 TRA Payments, in the aggregate, shall not exceed
$2,000,000 (the “2020 TRA Cap”).
(b) No Other Payments. From and after the date of this Amendment, the Corporation shall not make any payments pursuant to the TRA other than
the 2020 TRA Payments.
(c) If the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Section 2 of this Amendment shall be null and void ab initio and of no force
or effect and all of the Corporation’s obligations under the TRA shall continue in full force and effect as if this Amendment had never been executed;
provided, that automatically upon such termination and without the taking of any further action by the Corporation or any other Person, the Corporation
shall as promptly as practicable make any payments and distributions under the TRA that would have been payable prior to such termination but for the
application of provisions of this Section 2.
3. Amendment of TRA and LLC Agreement.
(a) Effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the effective time of the Merger under the Merger Agreement, the
TRA is hereby amended by inserting new Section 7.19 (as set forth below) into the TRA (it being understood and agreed that if the Merger Agreement is
terminated pursuant to its terms, this Section 3 of this Amendment shall be null and void ab initio and of no force or effect and the TRA shall continue in
full force and effect as if this Amendment had never been executed).
“Section 7.19 Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the effective time of the Merger without the taking of any further
action by the Corporation or any other Person; provided that the Amendment (as defined below), the provisions thereof and any other agreement
entered into in connection with the Amendment, and, in each case, any Person’s rights or obligations thereunder shall expressly survive
termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement: (i) the “Amendment” shall mean that certain Tax Receivable Agreement and LLC
Agreement Amendment, dated as of November 5, 2021 by and among the McAfee Parties, the TPG Nominee, the Intel Nominee, the TB Nominee,
the GIC TRA Party and the other parties thereto, as amended, together with the schedules and exhibits thereto; (ii) “Merger Agreement” shall mean
that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 5, 2021, by and among the Corporation, Condor BidCo, Inc., and Condor Merger
Sub, Inc.; and (iii) “Merger” shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, this Section 7.19 shall only take effect immediately prior to, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the effective
time of the Merger under the Merger Agreement (it being understood that this Section 7.19 shall have no force or effect whatsoever unless and
until immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger under the Merger Agreement).”
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the LLC Agreement or any of the other documents or agreements entered into in connection
therewith, each of the Parties hereby (i) agrees that there shall be no further “Tax Distributions” (as such term is defined in the LLC Agreement) for
so long as this Amendment is in effect and (ii) consents to all modifications to and waivers under the LLC Agreement as may be approved by the
Corporation, the Intel Nominee and the TPG Nominee after the date hereof that are reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to implement the
Exchange and Redemption as contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents
(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the amendment of the TRA and the LLC Agreement, as applicable, pursuant to the foregoing
Sections 3(a) and 3(b), and the termination of the TRA pursuant to new Section 7.19 of the TRA , shall not affect any Party’s obligations under the
remainder of this Amendment. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that (i) by entering into this Amendment, it is expressly consenting to
(x) the suspension of all Tax Distributions (as such term is defined under the LLC Agreement) under the LLC Agreement for so long as this Section
3 of this Amendment is in effect and (y) the termination of the TRA on the terms contemplated in Section 7.19 of the TRA as amended by Section
3(a) of this Amendment upon the effectiveness of the Merger under the Merger Agreement, (ii) upon execution of this Amendment, all Tax
Distributions (as such term is defined under the LLC Agreement) under the LLC Agreement shall be immediately suspended and shall terminate
from and after the effective time of the Merger under the Merger Agreement, and (iii) from and after the effective time of the Merger under the
Merger Agreement, no Person shall have any further payment or other obligation under the TRA or any obligation to make or pay Tax Distributions
under the LLC Agreement.
(d) If the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Section 3 of this Amendment shall be null and void ab initio and of
no force or effect and all of the Corporation’s obligations under the LLC Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if this Amendment had
never been executed; provided, that automatically upon such termination and without the taking of any further action by the Corporation or any
other Person, the Corporation shall as promptly as practicable make any payments and distributions under the LLC Agreement that would have
been payable but for the application of foregoing provisions of Section 3.
4. Intended Tax Treatment. The terms of Section 7.18 of the TRA (Tax Characterization and Elections) shall apply with respect to the tax treatment of
payments pursuant to or contemplated by Section 2 of this Amendment, and the TPG Nominee, the Intel Nominee and the Corporation shall work in good
faith (in a manner consistent with the principles and methodologies of the TRA) to determine which TRA payments are with respect to an Exchange
(except with respect to amounts that constitute Imputed Interest) and treated as additional consideration in respect of such Exchange, which TRA
Payments are made in respect of a Pre-IPO Covered Tax Asset and treated as a payment described in Section 351(b) of the Code (or an adjustment to the
applicable purchase price, as described in Section 7.18 of the TRA), and which TRA Payments constitute Imputed Interest, and the parties will not take
any position on a tax return or in an audit, examination or other proceeding inconsistent with the intended tax treatment described in Section 7.18 of the
TRA or this Section 4 except upon an applicable contrary Determination (as defined in the TRA). The Corporation will promptly provide the TPG Nominee
and Intel Nominee with such additional information and assistance as the TPG Nominee and Intel Nominee may reasonably request in connection with tax
reporting matters relating to the payments contemplated by this Amendment, the TRA and the Merger Agreement.
5. Amendment Termination. This Amendment shall terminate and shall be null and void ab initio and of no force or effect in its entirety upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms; provided, that the terms of Section 2(c) and 3(d) shall survive the termination of this
Amendment until the Corporation shall have made all payments required thereunder. In the event of a termination of this Amendment pursuant to this
Section 5, each of the TRA and LLC Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (without giving effect to any provisions
of this Amendment including, including without limitation, Sections 2 and 3 hereof).
6. Tax Matters.
(a) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Amendment, the following upper case terms shall have the following meanings.
(i) “Partnership Audit Rules” shall mean the provisions of Chapter 63 of the Code, as amended by the U.S. Bipartisan Budget Act of

promulgated in the future relating thereto, and any similar or analogous provisions of state, local and non-U.S. law.
(ii) “Pass-Through Tax Return” shall mean any income Tax Return filed by or with respect to LLC or any of its Subsidiaries to the
extent that (a) such entity is treated as a pass-through entity for purposes of such Tax Return and (b) the items reflected on such Tax

(iii) “Pre-Closing LLC Member” shall mean any member of LLC as of the date hereof or as of the beginning of the Closing Date other
than the Corporation or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries.
(iv) “Pre-Closing Tax Period” shall mean any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and that portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date.
(v) “Straddle Period” shall mean any taxable year or period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date.
(vi) “Tax Returns” shall mean any report, return (including any information return), declaration, form, administrative adjustment

required to be filed by the LLC and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. All such Pass-Through Tax Returns shall be prepared, and any
positions and elections relating thereto made, in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the applicable entity to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. The Corporation shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause LLC to deliver to each Pre-Closing LLC Member a draft
Schedule K-1 with respect to each Pre-Closing Tax Period within ninety (90) days after the end of such Pre-Closing Tax Period (and the Corporation
shall cause such draft Schedule K-1 to be delivered within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period, it
being understood that, in the case of a draft Schedule K-1 with respect to a Straddle Period of the LLC, references in this clause (i) to the “Pre-
Closing Tax Period” shall be interpreted as references to such Straddle Period), (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to each such Pre-
Closing LLC Member at such time of delivery of such draft Schedule K-1 good faith estimates of such other information reasonably requested by
the TPG Nominee, the TB Nominee and the Intel Nominee to assist in tax compliance matters, (iii) furnish to each such Pre-Closing LLC Member as
soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period, such information concerning LLC and its Subsidiaries with
respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Period as is required to enable such Member (or any beneficial owner of such Member) to pay estimated taxes or as
is requested by such Member for compliance with such Member’s tax obligations (or the obligations of any beneficial owner(s) of such Member).
Further, the Corporation shall make available to the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee a draft of any Pass-Through Tax Return described in this
Section 6(b) at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the due date (taking into account valid extensions) for filing such Pass-Through Tax Return
for the TPG Nominee’s and the Intel Nominee’s review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The TPG
Nominee, the Intel Nominee and the Corporation shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Pass-Through Tax
Returns prior to the applicable due date for filing (taking into account valid extensions). If the TPG Nominee, the Intel Nominee and the Corporation
do not resolve such disagreements on a mutually agreeable basis within twenty (20) calendar days after the TPG Nominee’s and the Intel Nominee’s
receipt of any such draft Pass-Through Tax Return, the remaining disputed items shall be resolved within an additional ten (10) calendar days by a
“Big 4” accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the TPG Nominee, the Intel Nominee and the Corporation (the “Referral Firm”) the determinations
of which shall be final and binding on the parties hereto), with costs and expenses of such Referral Firm to be borne by the Corporation.  
(c) Tax Claims. If the Corporation, LLC, or any of its Affiliates receives notice of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding,
examination, investigation or any demand or claim by a Taxing

Table of Contents
Authority (each a “Tax Claim”), in respect of any Pass-Through Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or in respect of a Tax Return the resolution
of which may require the TPG Nominee, the Intel Nominee or any Pre-Closing LLC Member to file an amended Tax Return or administrative
adjustment request (or state or local equivalent) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a “Pre-Closing Tax Claim”), then (i) such party will notify
the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee in writing of any such Pre-Closing Tax Claim within fifteen (15) days of receipt of written notice, (ii) such
party will keep the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee reasonably informed concerning the progress of such Pre-Closing Tax Claim, (iii) such party
will provide the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee copies of all correspondence and other documents relevant to such Pre-Closing Tax Claim, (iv)
the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee will each be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the defense of any Pre-Closing Tax Claim and (v)
such Pre-Closing Tax Claim shall not be settled, compromised or abandoned without the consent of the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, that any failure to give notice pursuant to clause (i) will not give rise to any liability, except to the
extent the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee (or any of their Affiliates) is actually prejudiced as a direct result of such party’s failure to give such
notice. In connection with the settlement, compromise or abandonment of any Tax Claim governed by the Partnership Audit Rules in accordance
with the previous sentence, (x) LLC shall be entitled to (and LLC shall be entitled to direct LLC, its “partnership representative” or its “designated
individual,” each as defined in the Code, or any equivalent designee under applicable state or local Law, to) make any election under Section 6226
of the Code or under Treasury Regulation Section 301.6227-2(c) (or any similar provision in any successor Code section or proposed or final
Treasury Regulations or under state, local or non-U.S. Law) for any taxable year of LLC that includes any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Pass-
Through Tax Return filed in respect of any such year and (y) except with the TPG Nominee’s and the Intel Nominee’s prior written consent, none of
LLC, the Corporation or any of their Affiliates shall elect the application of the Partnership Audit Rules to any Tax Return of LLC or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018; provided, that, except with the TPG Nominee’s and the Intel
Nominee’s prior written consent, no Pre-Closing LLC Member shall be required to amend any Tax Returns or file any administrative adjustment
request for any Pre-Closing Tax Period in connection with such Tax Claim.
(d) Corporation Post-Closing Tax Acts. Except as required by Law, LLC shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to not), without the prior
written consent of the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (i) change any method of
accounting or Tax reporting position for LLC or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) file any administrative
adjustment request (or state or local equivalent) or amended Tax Return (or file a Tax Return that would require a Pre-Closing LLC Member (or its
direct or indirect owners) to file an amended Tax Return or administrative adjustment request (or state or local equivalent)) with respect to LLC or
any of its Subsidiaries (or any successor of any of the foregoing) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iii) make any Tax election with respect to LLC
or any of its Subsidiaries that has retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) initiate or pursue the process for entering into a “voluntary
disclosure agreement” (or comparable arrangement) with a Taxing Authority with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of LLC or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any successor of the foregoing), or (v) take any action outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after the
Closing (other than as explicitly contemplated by this Amendment or the Merger Agreement), if, in the case of (i), (iii), (iv) or (v), the effect of such
change (A) would be reflected on a Pass-Through Tax Return or (B) involves a change in the classification of an entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (other than such a change in classification for an entity wholly-owned directly by a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of
the beginning of the Closing Date and on the preceding date).
(e) Certain Tax Elections.
(i) The parties hereto agree that the distributive shares of items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of LLC allocable to
members of LLC for the Straddle Period will be determined for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes based on the
“closing of the books” method

as described in Section 706(d)(1) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.706-1(c) (and corresponding provisions of state or local
income Tax Law where applicable) and applying the “calendar day” convention as of the end of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted
under Section 706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (applying such methods and conventions for both
LLC and any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which LLC owns a direct or indirect interest).
(ii) The parties hereto agree to treat Tax deductions arising from or relating to the closing of the transactions under the Merger
Agreement (including (v) the repayment of any indebtedness of the LLC or any of its Subsidiaries for borrowed money, (w) the payment or
incurrence of transaction-related expenses of LLC and its Subsidiaries, (x) the payment or incurrence of the amounts in respect of the
cancellation, termination, cash-out or exercise of stock options, and (y) the payment or incurrence of payroll taxes incurred with respect to
the foregoing) (the “Transaction Tax Deductions”) as deductible by the LLC in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and allocable to the Pre-Closing
LLC Members to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The parties hereto agree that seventy percent (70%) of success-based fees shall be
treated as so deductible by the Pre-Closing LLC Members in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2011-29, which LLC and its Subsidiaries
shall reflect on the applicable Pass-Through Tax Returns.
(f) Code Section 755 Allocation. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, the Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee an allocation of the
purchase price (for Tax purposes) of the equity interests in the LLC Units Exchanged for shares of Class A Common Stock of the Corporation as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement among the assets of the Corporation (the “Purchase Price Allocation”) in accordance with the
methodology set forth on Exhibit A hereto, to the extent such methodology reflects a reasonable approximation of the fair market value of such
assets, and otherwise in accordance with Sections 743, 751 and 755 of the Code. The TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee shall have a period of
thirty (30) days to present in writing to the Corporation notice of any objections that the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee may have to the
allocations set forth therein (an “Objections Notice”). If the Corporation shall raise any objections within such 30-day period, the TPG Nominee, the
Intel Nominee and the Corporation shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute. If the parties
described in this Section 6(f) fail to agree within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, any dispute shall be resolved by a “Big
4” accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the TPG Nominee, the Intel Nominee and the Corporation (the determinations of which shall be final
and binding on the parties hereto). The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne by the Corporation. LLC, the TPG Nominee, the
Intel Nominee and each of their Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns (and shall cause the Corporation to attach the statement required by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.743-1(k)(1) to their U.S. federal income Tax Returns for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date, which statement shall
set forth the computation of the basis adjustment and the allocation thereof in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation) in a manner
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation as determined pursuant to this Section 6(f) and shall not take any Tax Return reporting position that
is inconsistent with the foregoing, except upon a contrary determination by an applicable Taxing Authority. The Corporation shall timely and
properly prepare, execute, file and deliver to the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee all such documents, forms and other information as the TPG
Nominee or the Intel Nominee may reasonably request to review the Purchase Price Allocation.
(g) Cooperation. The parties hereto shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other party, in connection with
the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 6(g) and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party’s request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a reasonable basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder and reasonable written notice to the other party prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records
 
6
Table of Contents
and, if the other party so requests, the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee or the Corporation, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to
take possession of such books and records. The Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent required by applicable Law and shall abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any taxing authority.
(h) No Further Tax Obligations. Each of Corporation and LLC hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not and shall not permit any of its
controlled Affiliates to seek any reimbursement or indemnification from any of the Pre-Closing LLC Members in respect of Taxes (including Tax
Distributions) from and after the date of this Agreement.
7. Representations and Warranties of the Parties. Each of the Parties represents and warrants to the other Parties hereto as follows (which
representations and warranties shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations):
(a) Authorization of Transaction. Such Party has all requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute and deliver this
Amendment and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery by such Party of this Amendment and the performance by such
Party of this Amendment and the consummation by such Party of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of such Party. This Amendment has been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Party and

may be limited by general equitable principles or by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, or similar laws, legal
requirements and judicial decisions from time to time in effect which affect creditors’ rights generally.
(b) Non-contravention. Neither the execution and delivery by such Party of this Amendment, nor the consummation by such Party of the
transactions contemplated hereby, will (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the organizational documents of such Party, (ii) require on the
part of such Party any notice to or filing with, or any permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any governmental entity or (iii) violate any order,
writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to such Party or any of its properties or assets.
(c) No Additional Representations. Such Party acknowledges that no Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as
to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Corporation furnished or made available to such Party and its representatives in
connection with entering into this Amendment except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the TRA, the Merger Agreement or any Voting
Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
8. Third Party Beneficiary. The Parties agree that Parent is an express third party beneficiary of this Amendment and this Amendment is enforceable
by Parent in all respects. None of the provisions of this Amendment may be amended, modified or otherwise adjusted, and this Amendment may not be

withheld by Parent in its sole discretion).
9. Further Assurances. Each Party agrees to execute, acknowledge, deliver, file and record such further certificates, amendments, instruments and
documents, and to do all such other acts and things, as may be required by Law or as, in the reasonably judgment of the Corporation and the Intel

10. Notices. All notices, requests, consents and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be deemed to
have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by courier service, by electronic mail (delivery receipt requested) or by certified or registered

Table of Contents
12. Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Amendment together with the TRA and the LLC Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and except as expressly set forth herein (including in Section 8 and 15 with respect to
Parent), nothing in this Amendment, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Amendment.
13. Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of Delaware, without regard to
the conflicts of laws principles thereof that would mandate the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.
14. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Amendment is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all
other terms and provisions of this Amendment shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Parties. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, such term or provision is hereby deemed modified to give effect to the original written intent of
the parties to the greatest extent consistent with being valid and enforceable under applicable law. No party hereto shall assert, and each party shall
cause its Affiliates or related parties not to assert, that this Amendment or any part hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
15. Assignments; Amendments; Successors; No Waiver  
(a) Assignment. No Person may assign, sell, pledge, or otherwise alienate or transfer any of its interest in this Amendment, including the
right to receive payments as contemplated by this Amendment, to any other Person, except with the prior written consent of the Board, provided
that the TPG TRA Parties, the Intel Nominee, the TB TRA Parties and the GIC TRA Party (in each case, as defined in the TRA), may assign, sell,
pledge or otherwise alienate or transfer the right to receive payments as contemplated by this Amendment to any Person. In the case of any such
assignment, sale, pledge or other alienation of any such right by any Party to any other Person under the terms of this Section 15(a), such Person
shall execute and deliver a joinder in a form reasonably acceptable to each of Parent, the TPG Nominee and the Intel Nominee agreeing to succeed
to such payment and to become a Party for all purposes of this Amendment. None of the McAfee Parties may assign any of its rights or obligations
under this Amendment to any Person (other than a lender or any direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Corporation) without the prior written consent of each of the TPG Nominee and
the Intel Nominee (and any purported assignment without such consent shall be null and void).
(b) Amendments. No provision of this Amendment may be amended unless such amendment is approved in writing by each of the Board (or
any Person(s) to whom the Board has delegated such authority), the TPG Nominee, the Intel Nominee and Parent; provided, that any amendment
that materially and adversely affects one or more TRA Parties on a materially disproportionate basis relative to other similarly situated TRA parties
shall require the consent of a majority (measured by Tax Benefit Payments receivable) of such similarly situated TRA Parties so materially
disproportionately affected.
(c) Successors. Except as provided in Section 15(a), all of the terms and provisions of this Amendment shall be binding upon, and shall inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the Parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and
legal representatives. The Corporation shall require and cause any direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Corporation, by written agreement, expressly to assume and agree to perform
this Amendment in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform if no such succession had taken
place.
 
10
Table of Contents
(d) Waiver. No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement, or condition of this Amendment,
or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or any other covenant, duty,
agreement, or condition.
16. Titles and Subtitles. The titles of the sections and subsections of this Amendment are for convenience of reference only and are not to be
considered in construing this Amendment.
17. Resolution of Disputes; Interpretation. Notwithstanding any termination of the TRA, all disputes arising under this Amendment shall be
deemed to arise under the TRA and shall be resolved in accordance with Section 7.8 and Section 7.9 of the TRA, mutatis mutandis. Each of Sections 1.2,
7.8 and 7.9 of the TRA is hereby incorporated by this reference and made part of this Amendment, mutatis mutandis (it being understood that no
termination of the TRA shall affect the incorporation of such provisions into this Amendment).
18. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER OR
RELATE TO THIS AMENDMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AMENDMENT OR THE BREACH OR VALIDITY OF THIS AMENDMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AMENDMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 18.
19. Withholding. The Corporation and its affiliates and representatives shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment that is payable to
any TRA Party pursuant to this Amendment such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment in
accordance with the Code or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign tax law (including for this purpose any withholding required by the Corporation
or its affiliates that may be required in connection with the Reorganization, a Redemption or a Direct Exchange or other Exchange). To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Amendment as having been paid by the Corporation to the relevant TRA Party. The Corporation shall provide evidence of such payment to each TRA
Party in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made, to the extent that such evidence is available. Each TRA Party shall promptly provide
the Corporation with any applicable tax forms and certifications reasonably requested by the Corporation in connection with determining whether any
such deductions and withholdings are required under the Code or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign tax law, including under Sections 1441,
1442, 1445 or 1446 of the Code. The Corporation will consider in good faith any applicable certificates, forms or documentation provided by a TRA Party
that in such TRA Party’s reasonable determination reduce or eliminate any such withholding. Provided that the GIC TRA Party remains eligible for
benefits under Section 892 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and provides an effective and properly executed Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8EXP claiming exemption from U.S. federal income tax under Section 892 of the Code, the Corporation and its affiliates and
representatives shall not withhold U.S. federal tax on any amounts payable to the GIC TRA Party hereunder unless such withholding is otherwise
required by applicable law.
20. Independent Nature of Rights and Obligations.  
(a) The rights and obligations of the each Party hereunder are several and not joint with the rights and obligations of any other Person. A
Party shall not be responsible in any way for the performance of the
 
1
1
Table of Contents
obligations of any other Person hereunder, nor shall a TRA Party have the right to enforce the rights or obligations of any other Person hereunder
(other than the Corporation). Nothing contained herein or in any other agreement or document delivered at any closing, and no action taken by any
Party pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Parties acting as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind
of entity, or create a presumption that the Parties are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such rights or obligations or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Corporation acknowledges that the Parties are not acting in concert or as a group and will not assert any
such claim with respect to such rights or obligations or the transactions contemplated hereby.
(b) Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Amendment, (i) the actions of the Intel Nominee pursuant to and in accordance with this
Amendment shall be binding only with respect to the Intel TRA Parties and not with respect to the TPG Nominee or any other Parties, (ii) the
actions of the TPG Nominee pursuant to and in accordance with this Amendment shall be binding on all TPG TRA Parties and not with respect to
the Intel Nominee or any other Parties, and (iii) the actions of the Intel Nominee and TPG Nominee acting jointly shall be binding on all TRA Parties
including the Parties. To the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the TPG Nominee, the TPG TRA Parties, the Intel Nominee, the Intel TRA
Parties or any other Parties shall owe any duties (fiduciary or otherwise) to any other TRA Party or any other Person in determining to take or
refrain from taking any action or decision under or in connection with this Amendment. For purposes of this Amendment, the Parties acknowledge
that, in taking or omitting to take any action or decision hereunder, the TPG Nominee, each TPG TRA Party, the Intel Nominee, each Intel TRA Party
and each other Party shall be permitted to take into consideration solely its own interests and shall have no duty or obligation to give any
consideration to any interest of or factors affecting any other Party or any other Person.

Exhibit A
Purchase Price Allocation Methodology
This Purchase Price Allocation Methodology is intended to assist the parties in apportioning the purchase price (as determined for Tax purposes)
allocable to the equity of LLC Exchanged for shares of Class A Common Stock of the Corporation as contemplated by the Merger Agreement among the
assets of the Corporation (the “Purchase Price Allocation”).
For clarity, the allocation principles described below do not take into account any acquisition costs or selling expenses of any party, which such parties
may separately take into account. Further, the calculation of the amounts listed below (other than 6) shall not reflect the value of any asset to the extent
owned by an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, the methodology reflected here is based on
100% of the assets of McAfee Finance 2, LLC and not solely the portion of the assets attributable to the Pre-Closing LLC Members. Subject to the
