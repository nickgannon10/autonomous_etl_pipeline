unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically and without any required action on the part of the

has provided the paying agent with such stockholder’s stock certificates and a letter of transmittal, the paying agent will promptly pay such
stockholder the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder is entitled. Stockholders who hold Shares in book-entry form (other than
Shares held through The Depository Trust Company) will not be required to deliver stock certificates to the paying agent to receive the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled.
After the completion of the Merger, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a Tenneco stockholder (except that stockholders who hold Dissenting
Shares will not have the right to receive the Merger Consideration but will instead have the right to receive payment for the “fair
value” of their Dissenting Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to an appraisal proceeding in
accordance with Delaware law, as described in “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” on page 61 of this proxy statement).
Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (page 45)
The Company retained Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (“Lazard”) to act as a financial advisor to the Board in connection with the Merger. In
connection with this engagement, the Board requested that Lazard evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company
common stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders in the Merger.
On February 22, 2022, Lazard rendered an oral opinion to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion,
dated February 22, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations set forth in Lazard’s written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to
holders of Company common stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated February 22, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is included as Appendix B to this proxy statement
and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The summary of Lazard’s opinion included in the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion
of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC” is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read Lazard’s opinion
and that section carefully and in their entirety. Lazard’s opinion was provided for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) and Lazard’s
opinion was rendered to the Board in connection with the Board’s evaluation of the Merger. Lazard’s opinion did not address the relative merits
of the Merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company might engage or the merits of the underlying
decision by the Company to engage in the transaction. Lazard’s opinion was not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to
any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any matter relating thereto.
For a summary of Lazard’s opinion and the methodology that Lazard used to render its opinion, see the section titled “The Merger—Opinion
of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC” beginning on page 45.

Interests of the Directors and Officers of Tenneco in the Merger (page 55)
When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that certain of our
directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder.
The Board was aware of these interests in, among other matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that
the Merger Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Tenneco. These interests include the following:
•
Conversion of Equity Awards. Certain of our directors and executive officers hold equity awards, the treatment of which is described in
“The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Officers of Tenneco in the Merger—Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards” on page
56 of this proxy statement; and
•
Change in Control Severance Benefits. We maintain a Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for our executive officers that, upon our
termination of the executive officer’s employment without “Cause” or as the result of a “Constructive Termination” during the 24-month
period beginning on a “Change in Control” provides for (i) certain severance payments; (ii) continued participation in our group health, life
and disability plans coverage for a certain period of time after the termination date; and (iii) certain outplacement benefits, each as
described in “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Officers of Tenneco in the Merger—Severance Benefits” on page 57 of this
proxy statement.
If the Merger Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the Merger is completed, unvested equity awards will become vested and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described above, and any vested shares of Tenneco class A common stock
held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of Tenneco class A common stock held
by all other stockholders entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.
These interests are discussed in more detail in “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Officers of Tenneco in the Merger” on page 55 of
this proxy statement.

the Equity Commitment Letter.
Pursuant to a debt commitment letter, dated as of February 22, 2022 (which we refer to as the “Debt Commitment Letter”), a consortium of
financial institutions (in each case, acting directly or through their respective affiliates or branches, as appropriate, collectively, the
“Committed Lenders”) have committed to provide, severally but not jointly, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, the debt commitment amount, which we refer to as the “debt commitment,” in the aggregate up to $6.0 billion in debt
financing, consisting of (i) senior secured first lien credit facilities comprised of (A) a $2.4 billion first lien term loan facility (which we refer to

Merger) (which we refer to as the “revolving facility”), (ii) a $2.0 billion senior secured first lien bridge facility (which we refer to as the “senior
secured bridge facility”) (less (A) the amount of any Parent senior secured notes issued as described below and (B) the amount of any of

transactions) and (iii) a $1.0 billion senior unsecured bridge facility, which we refer to as the “senior unsecured bridge facility,” (less (A) the
amount of any Parent senior unsecured notes issued as described below and (B) the amount of any of Tenneco’s outstanding senior
unsecured notes that remain outstanding on the closing date after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions).
The Debt Commitment Letter also contemplates that Parent will, at its option, (i) either (A) issue senior secured first lien notes (which we
refer to as the “Parent senior secured notes”) in a Rule 144A or other private placement on or prior to

the closing date yielding up to $2.0 billion in aggregate gross cash proceeds and/or (B) if any or all of the Parent senior secured notes are not
issued on or prior to the closing date of the Merger and the proceeds thereof made available to Parent on the closing date of the Merger,
borrow up to such unissued or unavailable amount in the form of senior secured first lien bridge loans under the senior secured bridge facility
and (ii) either (A) issue senior unsecured notes (which we refer to as the “Parent senior unsecured notes”) in a Rule 144A or other private
placement on or prior to the closing date yielding up to $1.0 billion in aggregate gross cash proceeds and/or (B) if any or all of the Parent
senior unsecured notes are not issued on or prior to the closing date of the Merger and the proceeds thereof made available to Parent on the
closing date of the Merger, borrow up to such unissued or unavailable amount in the form of senior unsecured bridge loans under the senior
unsecured bridge facility.
Limited Guarantee (page 61)
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Sponsors entered into a limited guarantee, dated as of February 22, 2022 (the
“Limited Guarantee”) with Tenneco, pursuant to which the Sponsors have agreed to guarantee up to an aggregate cap of $115,000,000, and

circumstances, as well as costs incurred by Tenneco in collecting the termination fee and interest from the date the termination fee is
required to be paid, (ii) certain reimbursement, indemnification or payment obligations that may be owed by Parent in connection with certain
of the Company’s cooperation efforts for the debt financing, and (iii) up to $108,000,000 in recovery for damages suffered or incurred as a
result of Parent’s willful and material breach or fraud with respect to Parent’s representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in
the Merger Agreement.
Appraisal Rights (page 61)
If the Merger is completed, holders of shares of Tenneco class A common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and who properly demand an appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 of
the DGCL is required. Failure to timely and properly comply with such statutory requirements may result in the loss or waiver of your
appraisal rights. See the section entitled “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement and the text of the
Delaware appraisal rights statute, Section 262 of the DGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Appendix C to this proxy statement.
IN ORDER TO PROPERLY EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, YOU MUST DELIVER A
WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL TO TENNECO
BEFORE THE VOTE IS TAKEN ON THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AT THE MEETING, MUST NOT VOTE, IN PERSON
OR BY PROXY, IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL, MUST CONTINUE TO HOLD YOUR SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A
COMMON STOCK OF RECORD FROM THE DATE OF MAKING THE DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE TIME AND
MUST COMPLY WITH THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. MERELY VOTING AGAINST THE MERGER
PROPOSAL WILL NOT PRESERVE YOUR RIGHT TO APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. BECAUSE A PROXY THAT IS
SIGNED AND SUBMITTED BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE CONTAIN VOTING INSTRUCTIONS WILL, UNLESS REVOKED, BE VOTED IN
FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, IF YOU SUBMIT A PROXY AND WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL
RIGHTS, YOU MUST INCLUDE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTE YOUR SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK AGAINST,
OR ABSTAIN WITH RESPECT TO, THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. NEITHER VOTING AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT, NOR ABSTAINING FROM VOTING OR FAILING TO VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL, WILL IN AND OF
ITSELF CONSTITUTE A WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. THE
WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL MUST BE IN ADDITION TO AND SEPARATE FROM ANY PROXY OR VOTE ON THE ADOPTION OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK,
BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK,
BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE MAKING OF A DEMAND FOR

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 66)
The material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger generally are described in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 66 of this proxy statement; the tax consequences of Tenneco equity-based compensatory
arrangements are discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement. The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder (as defined in “The Merger—Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for the U.S. holder’s shares of Tenneco class A common stock in the
Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by the U.S. holder for such shares (determined before the deduction of
any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. The amount and character of such gain or loss will
be determined separately for each block of shares of Tenneco class A common stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction) exchanged for cash in the Merger.
The receipt of cash by a non-U.S. holder (as defined in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in
exchange for the non-U.S. holder’s shares of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger will generally not be subject to U.S. federal
income taxation unless (1) the non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States or (2) Tenneco is, or was during the relevant
period, a U.S. real property holding corporation.
Tenneco stockholders should refer to “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 66 of
this proxy statement for a more complete description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger and consult their
own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the Merger in light of their particular circumstances, as
well as any consequences arising under the U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws,
or under any state, local or non-U.S. tax law or under any applicable income tax treaty.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 70)
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) has expired or been terminated, clearance of the Merger has been granted by
relevant antitrust authorities in certain countries and the completion of foreign direct investment filings in certain jurisdictions.
Litigation Related to the Merger (page 72)
Seven complaints related to the merger have been filed through April 19, 2022. On March 15, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed
an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned O’Dell v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02135
(S.D.N.Y.) (the “O’Dell Complaint”). On March 17, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, captioned Truhlicka v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02199 (S.D.N.Y.) (the “Truhlicka Complaint”). On
March 18, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,
captioned Waterman v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01516 (E.D.N.Y) (the “Waterman Complaint”), and another purported stockholder of
Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, captioned Whitfield v. Tenneco Inc., et al.,
No. 2:22-cv-01052 (E.D. Pa.) (the “Whitfield Complaint”). On March 22, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Greenfield v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01571 (E.D.N.Y) (the
“Greenfield Complaint”). On March 29, 2022 a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, captioned Kirsch v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-00399 (D. Del.) (the “Kirsch Complaint,” and together with the O’Dell

2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting
Table of Contents
The Federal Complaints name Tenneco and members of its board of directors as defendants and allege that defendants made materially
incomplete and misleading statements about the proposed acquisition of Tenneco by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. Specifically,
the plaintiffs assert claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9, challenging the adequacy of disclosures
regarding the Company’s projections, Lazard’s financial analyses, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction in the
preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 14, 2022 (the “Preliminary Proxy”). The Federal Complaints seek, among other
relief, (i) injunctive relief preventing the parties from proceeding with the merger until the alleged disclosure deficiencies have been remedied,
(ii) rescission in the event the merger is consummated, (iii) damages, and (iv) an award of costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees and
expenses.
On March 30, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial District of the State of Illinois,
Lake County, captioned Drulias v. Armes, et al., No. 22CH00000102 (Ill. Cir. Ct. Lake Co.) (the “Drulias Complaint”). The Drulias Complaint
names Tenneco, members of its board of directors, and Apollo Global Management, Inc. as defendants. The plaintiff asserts claims for
violation of the Illinois Securities Act of 1953, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and concealment under Illinois
statutory and common law, alleges that the acquisition price and process was unfair to shareholders, and challenges the adequacy of
disclosures in the Preliminary Proxy regarding the Company’s projections, Lazard’s financial analyses and fairness opinion, management
conflicts of interest, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction. The Drulias Complaint seeks, among other relief, (i)
declaratory relief stating that defendants violated the Illinois Securities Act of 1953 and Illinois statutory and common law, (ii) injunctive relief
preventing defendants from holding a shareholder vote and proceeding with the merger until the alleged disclosure deficiencies have been
remedied, (iii) damages, and (iv) an award of costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses.
Stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the merger, which may name the Company, Merger Sub, Parent, or members of the
Board of Directors for the Company or Parent and/or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or
the complaint, including the amount of costs associated with defending, or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the
litigation of, such claims. Tenneco believes that the Complaints are without merit.
No Solicitation (page 82)
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement (as described in “Merger Proposal—No Solicitation by Tenneco” on page 82 of this
proxy statement), until the earlier of the closing date of the Merger and the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms,

solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist,
any inquiry or proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in “Merger
Proposal—No Solicitation by Tenneco”);
•
furnish to any third party any non-public information relating to Tenneco or its subsidiaries or afford to any third party access to the
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Tenneco or its subsidiaries, in any such case

Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

•
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
contract with respect to, or that is intended to result in, or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Transaction (as
defined in “Merger Proposal—No Solicitation by Tenneco”) (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval (as defined below), (i) Tenneco has received a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in “Merger Proposal—No Solicitation by Tenneco”) from a third party, (ii) the Acquisition Proposal (as defined
in “Merger Proposal—No Solicitation by Tenneco”) was not the result of any material breach of the non-solicitation restrictions in the Merger
Agreement and (iii) the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in
“Merger Proposal—No Solicitation by Tenneco”), Tenneco may participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish non-public
information relating to Tenneco and its subsidiaries, or afford access to non-public information, or to any personnel, of Tenneco or its
subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, the provisions of which are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Tenneco
than its confidentiality agreement with Apollo Management IX, L.P., to any third party or its representatives that has made or delivered to
Tenneco such Acquisition Proposal. Tenneco must provide to Parent and its representatives any non-public information that is provided to any
third party or its representatives given such access that was not previously made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently to
the time it is provided to such third party.
Subject to certain limited exceptions, until the receipt of the approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement by the vote of holders of
a majority of shares of Tenneco’s class A common stock outstanding as of the Record Date (as defined below) and entitled to vote on the
matter (the “Stockholder Approval"") neither our Board nor any committee thereof will:
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify, or modify or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify, or modify in any manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub in any material respect, its recommendation to approve the Merger;
•
adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal;
•
fail to include the Board’s recommendation to approve the Merger in this proxy statement;
•
within five business days of Parent’s written request, fail to make or reaffirm its recommendation to approve the Merger following the
date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first publicly disclosed or distributed to Tenneco’s stockholders;
•
cause or direct Tenneco or its subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (as defined in “Merger Proposal—No
Solicitation by Tenneco”); or
•
publicly propose or agree to any of the foregoing.
If Tenneco receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board may, provided that Tenneco has not breached the non-
solicitation restrictions in the Merger Agreement in any material respect with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, effect a Board
Recommendation Change (as defined in “Merger Proposal—No Solicitation by Tenneco”) with respect to such Superior Proposal or terminate
the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, subject to compliance with certain notice and other requirements
set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described in “Merger Proposal—No Solicitation by Tenneco"" on page 82 of this proxy statement). In
addition, Tenneco will not be permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal unless Tenneco pays the
termination fee described in “Merger Proposal—Company Termination Fee, Reverse Termination” on page 95 of this proxy statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, effect a Board Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in “Merger Proposal—No Solicitation
Tenneco Inc.

by Tenneco”) if the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do
so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law, subject to compliance with certain
notice and other requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described in “Merger Proposal—No Solicitation by Tenneco"" on page 82
of this proxy statement).
Conditions to the Closing of the Merger (page 92)
Tenneco and Parent expect to complete the Merger in the second half of 2022. However, it is possible that factors outside of each party’s
control could require them to complete the Merger at a later time or not to complete it at all. The following are some of the conditions that
must be satisfied or, where permitted by law, waived before the Merger may be completed:
•
the approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement by the vote of holders of a majority of shares of Tenneco’s class A common
stock outstanding as of April 20, 2022 (the “Record Date”) and entitled to vote on the matter having been obtained at the annual
meeting, or any adjournment thereof;
•
the consummation of the Merger not being restrained, enjoined or otherwise prohibited or made illegal by any outstanding order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any governmental entity;
•
the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, and the approvals, consents or consultations (or expirations or
terminations of waiting periods) required to consummate the Merger under other required competition and foreign direct investment laws
having been obtained (see “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger” on page 70 of this proxy statement).
•
the accuracy of representations and warranties of Tenneco, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, in the
Merger Agreement, as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the date of the closing of the Merger (except for representations
and warranties that relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true and correct as of such date or time)), subject to certain
materiality and “material adverse effect” qualifiers;
•
the performance or compliance in all material respects by Tenneco, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of
or with their respective covenants and agreements required to be performed or complied with by them under the Merger Agreement at or
before the closing date of the Merger (subject to a right to cure any failure of such compliance by the earlier of (i) 15 business days after
receipt of written notice of such failure or (ii) the third business day prior to the Outside Date); and
•
since the date of the Merger Agreement, there not having occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect under clause (b) of the definition
thereof (as defined in “Merger Proposal—Representations and Warranties”).
Subject to the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Parent is not required to consummate the Merger until the Marketing
Period (as defined in “Merger Proposal—Completion of the Transaction; Closing”) for Parent’s debt financing is completed.
Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 94)
The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time only as follows:
•
by mutual written consent of Tenneco and Parent;
•
by Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) or Tenneco:
•
if the Tenneco stockholder meeting (as it may be adjourned) has concluded and the Stockholder Approval has not been obtained;
•
if (i) the consummation of the Merger has been restrained, enjoined or otherwise made illegal by any outstanding order issued by
any governmental entity that is final and non-appealable or (ii) as of the Outside Date, the expiration or termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act shall not have occurred or the approvals required to consummate the Merger under the other required
competition and foreign direct
10
Table of Contents
investment laws shall not have been obtained; provided that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement in this way will not be
available to a party if such party’s material failure to comply with its obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement was the principal
cause of the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii).
•
by Tenneco:
•
if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have not been completed on or before the Outside Date; so long as
Tenneco’s breach of the Merger Agreement was not the principal cause of the failure to close prior to the Outside Date;
•
at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, if the Board authorizes Tenneco to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the Merger Agreement (provided that
Tenneco pays the Company Termination Fee to Parent concurrently with such termination);
•
if (i) there has been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub, in any material respect, of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in the Merger Agreement such that certain conditions to the consummation of the Merger are incapable of
being satisfied while such breach is continuing, (ii) Tenneco has delivered to Parent written notice of such breach and (iii) such
breach is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, is not cured by the earlier of (x) 30
days after Tenneco has provided notice of such breach to Parent and (y) the third business day prior to the Outside Date; provided,
however, that Tenneco may not terminate the Merger Agreement in this way if Tenneco is then in material breach of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in the Merger Agreement;
•
if (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the conditions to Parent’s obligations to complete the Merger have been satisfied
(other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied), (ii) Tenneco has delivered a written notice to Parent at least three business days prior to such termination confirming
that, if Parent performed is obligations and the debt financing was funded, Tenneco is ready, willing and able to consummate the
closing and (iii) Parent has failed to close within three business days after the later to occur of (x) delivery of the written notice of
such failure and (y) the date when the closing is required to occur under the Merger Agreement;
•
by Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub):
•
if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have not been completed on or before the Outside Date; so long as
Parent’s breach of the Merger Agreement was not the principal cause of the failure to close prior to the Outside Date;
•
prior to the time at which the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, if Tenneco effects a Board Recommendation Change or
Tenneco enters into a merger agreement, letter of intent or other similar agreement related to an alternative Acquisition Proposal
from a third party; or
•
if (i) there has been a breach, in any material respect, by Tenneco of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained
in the Merger Agreement such that certain conditions to the consummation of the Merger are incapable of being satisfied while
such breach is continuing, (ii) Parent has delivered to Tenneco written notice of such breach and (iii) such breach is not capable of
being cured prior to the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, is not cured by the earlier of (x) 30 days after Parent has
provided notice of such breach to Tenneco and (y) the third business day prior to the Outside Date; provided, however, that Parent
may not terminate the Merger Agreement in this way if Parent is then in material breach of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in the Merger Agreement.
Termination Fees (page 95)
Under the Merger Agreement Tenneco may be required to pay a termination fee of $54 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under
specified circumstances, and Parent may be required to pay a reverse termination fee of $108 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated
under specified circumstances. The termination fees and the circumstances under which they are payable are discussed in more detail in
“Merger Proposal—Company Termination Fee, Reverse Termination Fee” on page 95 of this proxy statement.

any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or equity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenneco is not entitled to specific performance of Parent’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded
and/or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, unless (i) the parties’ mutual conditions to the closing of the
Merger and the additional conditions to the closing of the Merger of Parent and Merger Sub have been satisfied or waived (other than the
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied assuming a
closing would occur), (ii) Parent fails to complete the closing by the date the closing is required to have occurred pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, (iii) the debt financing has been funded or will be funded at the closing if the equity financing is funded at the closing and

actions required to cause the closing of the Merger to occur.
Fees and Expenses (page 97)
All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, subject to certain provisions of the Merger Agreement; provided that Tenneco and Parent are each obligated to pay for

submissions made in connection with the Merger.",10,20

Questions and Answers",23,24
TENNECO INC_20220426_DEFM14A_20034100_4448087.Pdf,Questions and Answers,"Questions and Answers
The following questions and answers briefly address some commonly asked questions about the annual meeting, the Merger Agreement and
the Merger and the proposals being considered at the annual meeting. These questions and answers do not contain all of the details that may
be important to you as a stockholder of Tenneco. Therefore, Tenneco encourages you to carefully read this entire proxy statement, its
appendices and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated
by reference without charge by following the instructions under “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 160 of this proxy statement.
In this proxy statement, unless the context requires otherwise, the term “Tenneco” or “the Company” refers to Tenneco Inc., a Delaware
corporation, and its subsidiaries. The term “Parent” refers to Pegasus Holdings III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the term “Merger
Sub” refers to Pegasus Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the term “Apollo” refers collectively to
Apollo Global Management, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The term “Apollo Funds” means certain funds affiliated with Parent and Merger Sub and
managed by affiliates of Apollo. The term “Merger Agreement” refers to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 22, 2022, as
it may be amended from time to time, by and among Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms
“you” and the “Tenneco stockholders” refer to holders of Tenneco’s class A common stock.
Why is Tenneco sending this proxy statement and proxy card?
On February 22, 2022, Tenneco entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Tenneco, with
Tenneco surviving as a privately held, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”). Tenneco’s Board of Directors, which we refer to as the
“Board of Directors” or the “Board”, is soliciting the vote of the Tenneco stockholders to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
and approve the Merger and the other matters to be voted on at the annual meeting. The Merger cannot occur without the required approval of
Tenneco’s stockholders. In addition to the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger, the Board is soliciting the vote of
the Tenneco stockholders to approve each of the other proposals described below in “—What matters will be voted on at the annual meeting?”
What matters will be voted on at the annual meeting?
At the annual meeting, Tenneco stockholders will consider and vote on the following matters:
•
To adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger, pursuant to which Tenneco will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the “Merger Proposal”);
•
To approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of
Tenneco in connection with the Merger (the “Merger Compensation Proposal”);
•
To approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve
the Merger if there are insufficient votes at the time of the annual meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Adjournment Proposal”);
•
The election of the 10 director nominees named in this proxy statement to our Board, each for a term of one year;
•
The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent public accountants for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2022;
•
To approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, our executive compensation; and
•
To act upon other business that may properly come before the annual meeting or any adjournment thereof by or at the direction of the
Board.
If the Tenneco stockholders approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger is completed, Tenneco will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent at the Effective Time (such date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the “Effective
Time”).
16Table of Contents
If the Merger is completed, what will I be entitled to receive for my shares?
If the Merger is completed, Tenneco stockholders at the Effective Time will be entitled to receive $20.00 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”)
for each share of class A common stock they own (each, a “Share”, and collectively, the “Shares”). The Merger Consideration will be payable
in cash (without interest) and subject to any applicable withholding taxes required by applicable law.
If the Merger is completed, Tenneco stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand
an appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. Strict compliance with the statutory
procedures in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to timely and properly comply with such statutory requirements may result in the
loss or waiver of your appraisal rights. See “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” on page 61 of this proxy statement.
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Tenneco class A common stock prior to
the public announcement of the Merger Agreement?
The Merger Consideration represents a premium of 100.4% to Tenneco’s closing stock price on February 22, 2022, the last trading day before
the Merger Agreement was announced, and a premium of 71.6% over the 90-day volume-weighted average on the same date.
If the Merger is completed, what will I be entitled to receive for my restricted stock units or my performance
share units?
At the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger:
•
Each outstanding award of Tenneco cash-settled restricted stock units (each, a “Cash-Settled RSU”), whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof
or Tenneco, become fully vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject
to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock underlying
such award of Cash-Settled RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.
•
Each outstanding award of Tenneco share-settled restricted stock units (each, a “Share-Settled RSU” and, together with the Cash-
Settled RSUs, the “Company RSUs”) that at such time is subject solely to service-based vesting conditions shall become fully vested
and shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or Tenneco, be cancelled and be converted into
the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (x) the total
number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock underlying such award of Share-Settled RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration.
•
Each outstanding award of Tenneco cash-settled performance share units (each, a “Cash-Settled PSU”), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof or Tenneco, become fully vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock (or
share equivalents) underlying such award of Cash-Settled PSUs (based on all applicable performance criteria being achieved at target
performance), multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.
•
Each outstanding award of Tenneco share-settled performance share units (each, a “Share-Settled PSU”, and together with the Cash-
Settled PSUs, “Company PSUs”) that at such time is subject to performance-based vesting conditions that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become vested as to the number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock subject to such award
that would vest at the target level, and

shall, after giving effect to such vesting, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or Tenneco, be
cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes)
equal to the product of (x) the number of vested shares of Tenneco class A common stock underlying such award, multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration.
Am I entitled to appraisal rights?
Yes. As a holder of Shares, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger if you take certain
actions and meet certain conditions. See the section entitled “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement
and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute, Section 262 of the DGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Appendix C to this
proxy statement.
Is the Merger subject to the satisfaction of any conditions?
Yes. In addition to the approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement by the Tenneco stockholders, the Merger is subject to the
satisfaction of various conditions. For a description of these conditions, please see the section entitled “Merger Proposal—Conditions to
Closing of the Transaction” beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement.
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
In order to complete the Merger, Tenneco must obtain the approval of the Tenneco stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement as described
in this proxy statement and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement must be satisfied, including the receipt of applicable
regulatory approvals. Tenneco currently expects to complete the Merger in the second half of 2022. Tenneco cannot assure you that the
Merger will be completed by any particular date.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is not approved by the requisite vote of Tenneco stockholders, or if the Merger is not
consummated for any other reason, the Tenneco stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the Merger.
Instead, Tenneco will remain a public company, its shares of class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the New York
Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and we will
continue to file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, or may be entitled to receive a reverse termination fee
from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in “Merger Proposal—Company Termination Fee; Reverse
Termination Fee” on page 95 of this proxy statement.
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income taxation upon the exchange of my shares of Tenneco class A
common stock for the Merger Consideration?
Other than with respect to Tenneco equity-based compensatory arrangements, which are described in the next question and answer below,
the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger are described in “The Merger— Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 66 of this proxy statement. If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “The Merger—Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of your shares of Tenneco class A common stock for cash pursuant to
the Merger will generally require you to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if
any, between the amount of cash you receive for such shares (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and your
adjusted tax basis in such shares.

If you are a non-U.S. holder (as defined in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of
your shares of Tenneco class A common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation
unless (1) you have certain connections to the United States or (2) Tenneco is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding
corporation.
A more complete description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided in “The Merger—Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 66 of this proxy statement. You should consult your tax advisor
concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the Merger in light of your particular circumstances, as well as any
consequences arising under the U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws, or under any
state, local or non-U.S. tax law or under any applicable income tax treaty.
What tax consequences will there be relating to my restricted stock units and performance share units?
If you hold Company RSUs or Company PSUs at the Effective Time, then you will generally recognize taxable income for U.S. federal income
tax purposes equal to the cash payment you receive for your Company RSUs and Company PSUs, as further described above. This will be
treated as ordinary compensation income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and subject to income and other payroll tax withholding.
Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are forfeited prior to closing (pursuant to termination of employment or otherwise) will not be
entitled to any consideration at the close of the Merger.
If you previously received Tenneco class A common stock in settlement of Company RSUs or Company PSUs and already recognized
ordinary income on such Tenneco class A common stock at the time of such settlement, then you will generally recognize a capital gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the income you previously recognized and the amount paid for the
stock in the Merger. The capital gain or loss will be long-term if more than one year has expired between the time you recognized the income
and the Merger. Holders of such Tenneco class A common stock received in settlement of Company RSUs or Company PSUs generally will
not be subject to income or other payroll tax withholding on any such capital gain.
What effect will the Merger have on Tenneco and its common stock?
Tenneco’s class A common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the NYSE under the symbol “TEN”. As a
result of the Merger, Tenneco will become a privately held, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a private company following the completion
of the Merger, the registration of Tenneco’s class A common stock and Tenneco’s obligation to file reports and make other public disclosures
to the SEC under the Exchange Act will be terminated, and Tenneco’s class A common stock will no longer be listed on the NYSE. Tenneco
stockholders will cease to have any equity interest in Tenneco and will have no right to participate in its earnings and future growth.
Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the named executive officers of Tenneco in connection with the Merger?
Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires Tenneco to conduct a non-binding advisory vote with respect to certain “golden parachute”
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Tenneco’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, including the
agreements and understandings with Tenneco pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable.

2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting
Table of Contents
What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Merger Compensation Proposal at the annual
meeting?
Approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Merger
Compensation Proposal is on an advisory basis and will not be binding on Tenneco or Parent. Further, the underlying compensation plans and
agreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
How does Tenneco’s Board of Directors recommend that I vote on the proposals?
After consulting with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and after reviewing and considering the terms and conditions of the
Merger and the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Tenneco and its
stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Tenneco for adoption, and (iv) recommended that the
Tenneco stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, Tenneco’s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote:
•
FOR the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger (Item 1);
•
FOR the proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of Tenneco in connection with the Merger (Item 2); and
•
FOR the proposal to approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement and approve the Merger if there are insufficient votes at the time of the annual meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement (Item
3).
To review the Board’s reasons for recommending the Merger, see the section entitled “The Merger—Recommendation of Our Board of
Directors and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 41 of this proxy statement.
In addition, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote:
•
FOR the election of all nominees for election as director described in this proxy statement (Item 4);
•
FOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent public accountants for 2022 (Item 5); and
•
FOR the approval, by a non-binding advisory vote, of our executive compensation (Item 6).
Do any of Tenneco’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from or be
in addition to my interests as a stockholder?
Yes. In considering the recommendation of Tenneco’s Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and
approve the Merger, you should be aware that Tenneco’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or
in addition to, the interests of Tenneco’s stockholders generally. Tenneco’s Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests,
among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement
be adopted by the stockholders of Tenneco. See the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Officers of Tenneco in the
Merger” beginning on page 55 of this proxy statement.

What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered, with respect to
those shares, the “stockholder of record.” If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other record holder, you are
considered the “beneficial owner” of shares held in “street name.” As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or
other record holder on how to vote your shares, and you are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Your broker, bank or other record
holder should have enclosed or provided voting instructions for you to use in directing the voting of your shares.
What do I need to do to attend the Annual Meeting online?
Due to the ongoing public health impact of the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) and to support the health and well-being of our partners and
stockholders, we will be hosting the Annual Meeting via the Internet. It will be a completely virtual meeting. You will not be able to attend the
Annual Meeting physically, but your right to vote will not be affected and you will be able to submit questions and access the list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting electronically during the annual meeting.
You are entitled to participate in the Annual Meeting if you were a stockholder as of the close of business on April 20, 2022. To be admitted to
the Annual Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TEN2022, you must enter the control number found on your proxy card, voting
instruction form or notice card. If you are a beneficial shareholder, you may contact the bank, broker or other record holder where you hold
your account if you have questions about obtaining your control number.
We encourage you to access the Annual Meeting online up to 30 minutes prior to its start time. If you encounter any difficulties accessing
the Virtual Annual Meeting during the check-in or meeting time, please contact the technical support number that will be posted on the log-in
page.
Additional information regarding the rules of conduct will be posted prior to and during the meeting at the abovementioned website.
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?
Only holders of record of our class A common stock at the close of business on April 20, 2022 (the “Record Date”) are entitled to vote. There
were 83,380,100 shares of class A common stock outstanding on April 20, 2022. Stockholders are entitled to cast one vote per share of
class A common stock on all matters. There were 0 shares of class B non-voting common stock outstanding on April 20, 2022.
How do I vote my shares during the Annual Meeting?
During the Annual Meeting, you may vote shares held in your name as the stockholder of record or held in street name as the beneficial
owner by following the instructions available on the meeting website, proxy card, voting instruction form or notice card.
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also submit your proxy or voting instructions as described below so
that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.
How do I vote my shares without attending the Annual Meeting?
There are three ways to vote by proxy:
•
By Internet — You can vote over the internet by following the instructions on the Notice or proxy card;

If your shares are held in street name, follow the voting instructions on the form that you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. The
availability of telephone and internet voting will depend on the bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting process. Your bank, broker or other
nominee may not be permitted to exercise voting discretion as to some of the matters to be acted upon. Therefore, please give voting
instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee.
Unless you hold your shares through the Company’s 401(k) plans, you may vote via the internet or by telephone until 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Time, on June 6, 2022, or the Company’s agent must receive your paper proxy card on or before June 6, 2022. If you hold your shares through

May I revoke or change my vote?
If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is actually voted by giving written notice of revocation to
our Corporate Secretary, by delivering a proxy bearing a later date (including by telephone or by internet) or by attending virtually and voting
during the Annual Meeting. Virtual attendance at the Annual Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you
specifically make that request. If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your bank,
broker or other record holder or, by attending virtually and voting during the Annual Meeting.
Will my vote be made public?

What constitutes a quorum, permitting the Annual Meeting to conduct its business?
The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of class A common
stock as of the record date is considered a quorum for the transaction of business. If you submit a properly completed proxy or if you virtually
attend the Annual Meeting to vote during the meeting, your shares of class A common stock will be considered part of the quorum.
Abstentions and “broker non-votes” are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker non-vote
occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder
does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.
The Merger Proposal (Item 1), Merger Compensation Proposal (Item 2), Adjournment Proposal (Item 3), election of directors (Item 4), and the
advisory vote on executive compensation (Item 6) are “non-discretionary” items, while ratifying the appointment of our independent public
accountants (Item 5) is a discretionary item. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote with respect to any of these
items, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote with respect to the applicable proposal and those votes will be counted as “broker
non-votes.”
How many votes are needed to approve a proposal?
Assuming the presence of a quorum, the affirmative vote by holders of at least a majority of the voting power represented by the Shares that
are outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required for the adoption of the Merger Proposal (Item 1). Because the vote standard for the
approval of this proposal is a majority of the voting power represented by the Shares that are outstanding and entitled to vote thereon,
abstentions and broker non-votes have the effect of a vote against the proposal.
Assuming the presence of a quorum, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Shares present, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting and
entitled to vote is required to: (i) ratify the Merger Compensation Proposal (Item 2), (ii) ratify the Adjournment Proposal (Item 3), (iii) ratify the
appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent public accountants for 2021 (Item 5) and (iv) to approve, by a non-binding
advisory vote, our executive compensation (Item 6). Because the vote standard for the approval of these proposals is a majority of shares
present and entitled to vote, abstentions have the effect of a vote against the proposals and broker non-votes have no effect on the proposals.
Assuming the presence of a quorum, each director nominee receiving a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting (in person or by
proxy) will be elected as a director (Item 4). A “majority of the votes cast” means the number of “For” votes cast exceeds the number of
“Against” votes cast. A proxy marked “Abstain” with respect to any director will not be counted in determining the total number of votes cast.
Because the election of directors is determined on the basis of a majority of the votes cast, abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect
on the election of directors.
Should I send in my Tenneco stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
No. After the Merger is completed, the paying agent to be engaged by Parent in connection with the Merger will send to each of Tenneco’s
stockholders written, detailed instructions for exchanging your stock certificates for the Merger Consideration. You must return your stock
certificates as described in the instructions. If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive
instructions from the broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the exchange of your “street name”
shares for the Merger Consideration. Please do not send in any certificates now.
What happens to my vote if I sell my shares before the Annual Meeting?
The Record Date is earlier than both the date of the annual meeting and the consummation of the Merger. If you transfer your Shares after the
Record Date but before the annual meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the
person to whom you transfer your Shares and each of you notifies

Who will count the vote?

How can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?
We will report the voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the end of the Annual Meeting.
How is the solicitation being made?
The cost of solicitation of proxies will be borne by us. Solicitation will be made by mail, and may be made by directors, officers and
employees, personally or by telephone, email or fax. Proxy cards and materials also will be distributed to beneficial owners of stock through
brokers, custodians, nominees and other like parties, and we expect to reimburse such parties for their charges and expenses. We have
engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist us in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $50,000 plus expense reimbursement.
Does Tenneco allow stockholders to have proxy access for the nomination of directors?
Yes. The Board has adopted proxy access By-Law provisions to permit eligible stockholders to include nominees in the Company’s proxy
statement and form of proxy. See “Submission of Stockholder Proposals” on page 159 of this proxy statement for further information.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into Tenneco,
with Tenneco continuing as the Surviving Corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As promptly as practicable following the
effective time of the Merger (such date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the “Effective Time”), Tenneco class A
common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and de-registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”), and at such time, we will cease to be a publicly traded company and will no longer be obligated to file
periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, and
instead will only be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in “— Merger Consideration” on page 75 of this proxy statement or,
with respect to any Shares held by stockholders who are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance
with, and who comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, the “Dissenting Shares”), you will only be entitled to
receive the “fair value” of your Dissenting Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as
contemplated by Delaware law. The Effective Time will occur at the time the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (or at such later time as we, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).",36,36

If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the requisite vote of Tenneco stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
you will not receive any payment for your shares of Tenneco class A common stock. Instead, we will remain as a public company, Tenneco
class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange and registered under the Exchange Act and we
will be required to continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Furthermore, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, it is possible that the price of Tenneco class A
common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Tenneco class A common stock would
return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the future value of your shares of Tenneco class A common
stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board will continue to evaluate and review our business operations, properties, dividend policy and
capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder value. If the
Merger Proposal is not approved by the requisite vote of Tenneco stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there
can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operation
will not be adversely impacted.

termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described under “Merger Proposal— Company Termination
Fee, Reverse Termination Fee” on page 95 of this proxy statement.

sale or other extraordinary transactions involving one or more of our business units. In connection with these activities, from time to time, Mr.
Brian Kesseler, Chief Executive Officer of Tenneco, together with other members of our management team, have held meetings with industry
participants, strategic parties and financial sponsors regarding Tenneco and its business, strategy and financial position. Mr. Kesseler
regularly updates the Board with respect to these meetings, including as part of the Board’s regularly scheduled discussions of Tenneco’s
business strategy and potential strategic and financial alternatives to maximize stockholder value.
In April 2018, Tenneco announced the acquisition of Federal-Mogul LLC (“Federal-Mogul”), a supplier to original equipment manufacturers and
the aftermarket, for a total of $5.4 billion (the “Federal-Mogul Transaction”). Tenneco indicated its intention to create two separate companies,
an aftermarket and ride performance company that combined the Tenneco Ride Performance business with the Federal-Mogul Motorparts
business (we refer to these combined businesses as “DRiV”) and a powertrain technology company that combined the Tenneco Clean Air
business and the Federal-Mogul Powertrain business, including at the time Federal-Mogul’s Systems Protection business (we refer to these
combined businesses as “Powertrain Technology”). These companies were proposed to be separated into two publicly traded companies
through a tax-free spin-off of DRiV to Tenneco’s stockholders. The Federal-Mogul Transaction closed in October 2018 and, at the time,
Tenneco indicated that it expected the separation of DRiV and Powertrain Technology to occur in late 2019.
In the fourth quarter of 2018 and continuing into the first quarter of 2019, the market environment weakened in the auto sector, amplified by an
increasingly challenging trade relationship between the United States and China, and Tenneco began to feel constrained by its debt levels and
resulting leverage ratios. In connection with the announcement of its first quarter results of operations, in May 2019, Tenneco indicated that it
had revised its timing target for the separation of DRiV and Powertrain Technology, and expected the DRiV spin-off to occur in mid-2020.
During the summer and into the fall of 2019, Tenneco continued its work on the administrative separation of DRiV and Powertrain Technology,
with the goal of having the businesses ready to operate independently by the end of 2019, but continued to face weakness in the auto
sector’s market environment, evidenced by, among other things, lower global light vehicle production volumes and signs of softening in the
commercial truck market and the challenges of its debt levels and resulting leverage ratios. Recognizing these trends as challenges to the
separation of DRiV and Powertrain Technology, the Board initiated a process to evaluate potential strategic options for Tenneco, including
options to deleverage and facilitate the separation, as well as the potential sale of the Powertrain Technology business. Tenneco worked with
its financial and legal advisors, on a confidential basis, to solicit potential interest in the purchase of the Powertrain Technology business,
including outreach to 13 potentially interested parties, including one strategic party and 12 financial sponsors.
In connection with the announcement of its third quarter results of operations, in October 2019, Tenneco provided an update on its efforts to
separate DRiV and Powertrain Technology, announcing that Tenneco was evaluating potential strategic options to deleverage and facilitate the
separation, and noting that then-current trends, if they were to continue, would likely affect Tenneco’s ability to complete a separation in the
mid-year 2020 time range.

2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents
In October 2019, Tenneco received non-binding proposals to acquire Powertrain Technology from two financial sponsors. Apollo proposed a
transaction with an implied enterprise value for Powertrain Technology in the range of $4.5 to $5.0 billion, and another financial sponsor
proposed a transaction with an implied enterprise value for Powertrain Technology of $3.5 billion. The enterprise values proposed were made
before giving effect to adjustments for outstanding debt, pension and other liabilities of Powertrain Technology. Although the Board believed
both proposals undervalued Powertrain Technology at the time, Tenneco determined to move forward with customary due diligence with Apollo
to explore whether Apollo would increase its purchase price. Apollo ultimately advised Tenneco that it was only willing to proceed on the basis
of a proposal with an implied enterprise value for Powertrain Technology of $4.3 billion, and Tenneco concluded that it was not in the best
interests of Tenneco stockholders to pursue that transaction and terminated such discussions in December 2019.
On January 20, 2020, the Board held a special meeting, attended by Tenneco management, representatives of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC
(“Lazard”) and Tenneco’s legal counsel. After Lazard and Tenneco’s legal counsel left the meeting, the Board discussed, among other things,
the on-going efforts to explore the separation of DRiV, either by way of a tax-free spin-off or a sale transaction, as well as other potential
strategic and financial alternatives available to Tenneco. The Board determined to publicly reconfirm its ongoing strategic alternatives review
process and to engage Lazard as a financial advisor to assist in its review.
On January 27, 2020, Tenneco issued a press release reconfirming its ongoing review of potential strategic alternatives to maximize
stockholder value, including the engagement of Lazard as a financial advisor to the Board. Tenneco indicated that it was reviewing and
considering, in addition to its plan to spin-off DRiV, a full range of potential strategic options including the sale of DRiV and/or the sale of
Powertrain Technology. Tenneco also announced that it had made significant progress to facilitate the planned spin-off of DRiV and had
substantially completed the necessary system and process components required for Powertrain Technology and DRiV to operate
independently.
Beginning in March 2020 and continuing throughout 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021, the Board met numerous times with its financial
and legal advisors to review Tenneco’s business, strategy, financial position and operations, in light of the developing COVID-19 pandemic, as
well as the potential strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including the previously planned spin-off of DRiV (and the potential for a rights
offering to provide additional financing concurrently with the spin-off), a potential sale of Powertrain Technology and a potential exchange offer
for Powertrain Technology. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the challenges of its high debt levels and resulting leverage
ratios, impacted the ability of Tenneco to execute any of these alternatives. The Board and its advisors also explored and had discussions
with various potential buyers regarding a potential sale or other transaction involving certain other business units, including Systems
Protection and Motorparts. While Tenneco received an unsolicited non-binding offer from a special purpose acquisition company, or “SPAC”,
to acquire Motorparts, none of the other third-party discussions resulted in a proposal for the acquisition of or other business combination with
the entire company, or the acquisition of or other business combination with any of Tenneco’s other business units (either alone or in
combination). Tenneco and the Board evaluated the potential de-SPAC transaction involving Motorparts and determined that none of the
potential de-SPAC transaction, the potential sale of the Systems Protections business or the other potential business unit sale transactions
(including a sale of the Systems Protection business) would meaningfully reduce Tenneco’s relative debt levels and resulting leverage ratios,
or otherwise meaningfully increase equity value relative to Tenneco’s standalone business strategy. Throughout this period, representatives of
Apollo maintained periodic contact with Mr. Kesseler and Mr. Masanovich, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, expressing Apollo’s continued interest in Tenneco and Powertrain and Clean Air.
On March 2, 2021, representatives from Apollo contacted Tenneco to express Apollo’s continued interest in exploring a potential acquisition of
Powertrain and Clean Air.
On May 13, 2021, the Board held a regular meeting at Tenneco’s headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois attended by Tenneco management and
representatives of Lazard. The Lazard representatives reviewed Tenneco’s business segments and financial position, as well as Tenneco’s
standalone business strategy, current market valuation and related financial considerations for Tenneco, noting that Tenneco’s stock price
traded below its peers and illustrative
30
Table of Contents
“sum of the parts” analysis due to, among other things, Tenneco’s high leverage and exposure to internal combustion engine businesses. The
Lazard representatives also discussed potential strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including the potential sale of Powertrain and
Clean Air. It was noted that the potential sale of Powertrain and Clean Air could be a viable strategy to reduce Tenneco’s debt levels and
resulting leverage ratios and eliminate Tenneco’s exposure to internal combustion engine businesses. After discussion, the Board authorized
management to work with Lazard to prepare for the potential sale of Powertrain and Clean Air and outreach to Apollo, given its expressions of
continued interest in Powertrain and Clean Air.
Throughout June, July and August of 2021, Tenneco’s management worked to develop a standalone business plan and financial estimates for
Powertrain and Clean Air in preparation for an anticipated sale process to commence in early September 2021.
On August 10 and 11, 2021, the Board held a regular meeting at Tenneco’s headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois attended by Tenneco
management and representatives from Lazard. During the meeting, Mr. Kesseler reviewed Tenneco’s business and financial position, including
an update to Tenneco’s share price performance, cash flows, debt position and resulting leverage. Representatives from Lazard discussed a
range of potential strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including potential alternatives for Powertrain and Clean Air and the financial
aspects of a potential sale transaction involving Powertrain and Clean Air. The representatives from Lazard then discussed the historical
outreaches from Apollo and Apollo’s strategic interest in internal combustion engine assets, Apollo’s continued expressions of interest in
Powertrain and Clean Air, and an overview of the proposed process to solicit an indication of interest from Apollo. After discussion, the Board
instructed management and Lazard to initiate discussions with Apollo with respect to a potential sale of Powertrain and Clean Air, including
by providing confidential business and financial information to Apollo pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement.
On August 17, 2021, Apollo entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with Tenneco with respect to confidential information furnished
to Apollo in connection with the potential negotiated acquisition of Powertrain and Clean Air. The confidentiality agreement included an 18-
month standstill provision but permitted confidential proposals to be made to the Board at any time and provided for termination of the
standstill upon the public announcement of any proposal to acquire more than 50% of Tenneco’s class A common stock.
On September 10, 2021, customary marketing materials with respect to Powertrain and Clean Air were furnished to Apollo, including a
business overview and standalone financial estimates for the Powertrain and Clean Air business units.
On September 14, 2021, representatives from Apollo sent a business due diligence request list to Tenneco, requesting customary business
and financial data to allow Apollo to develop a preliminary proposal. Representatives from Lazard met via videoconference with representatives
of Apollo to discuss the request list on September 15, 2021, and Apollo subsequently sent an updated business due diligence request list to
reflect the parties’ conversation. Tenneco management worked with representatives of Lazard from September 15, 2021 through September
28, 2021 to produce relevant documentation in response to the Apollo business due diligence request.
On September 28, 2021, Tenneco’s management and representatives of Lazard held an in-person meeting with representatives from Apollo in
Lazard’s offices in New York City to review the business, strategy, financial position and operations of Powertrain and Clean Air.
On October 3, 4 and 13, 2021, in response to additional due diligence requests submitted by Apollo, Tenneco provided additional business
and financial data to Apollo regarding Powertrain and Clean Air.
On October 13, 2021, representatives from Apollo submitted a preliminary non-binding proposal to acquire Powertrain and Clean Air for an
adjusted total enterprise value (which Apollo indicated represented enterprise value plus pension liabilities, factored receivables and minority
interests) of between $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion. Apollo’s proposal was not subject to a financing contingency. Apollo indicated it would
require an exclusivity period of 60 days, commencing

when Apollo received responses to its due diligence requests. Apollo also requested that Tenneco reimburse Apollo’s expenses, up to $3
million, if the parties did not mutually agree to the proposed transaction by the termination of the exclusivity period.
On October 19, 2021, the Board held a special meeting, attended by Tenneco management, representatives from Lazard and representatives
from Tenneco’s outside legal counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP (referred to herein as “Latham”), to discuss the potential sale of Powertrain and
Clean Air, including the indication of interest and request for exclusivity and expense reimbursement from Apollo. Mr. Thomas J. Sabatino,
Tenneco’s Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and representatives of Latham provided legal advice regarding the Board’s fiduciary
duties, both generally and in the context of the potential Powertrain and Clean Air sale transaction. Representatives from Lazard reviewed the
financial aspects of Apollo’s proposal, a preliminary pro forma financial analysis of the proposed transaction, an overview of a preliminary
process timeline, a review of the prior 2019 process with Apollo with respect to the potential sale of Powertrain Technology, and an update on
automotive electrification trends and their implications for the industry. The Board also discussed Apollo’s request for exclusivity and expense
reimbursement in order to proceed with diligence and discussions regarding the proposed transaction. Representatives of Lazard reviewed
prior marketing efforts for these businesses and, following discussion with management and taking into account advice from representatives of
Lazard, the Board believed it was unlikely that another strategic or private equity bidder would be willing to offer a purchase price in excess of
the current Apollo proposal and that, absent a sale of both businesses to the Apollo Funds, a sale of the two businesses separately likely
could only be completed in 2022 (or later). It was also noted that other similarly situated companies had publicly announced, or otherwise
communicated, intentions to divest similar businesses exposed to the internal combustion engine industry, which could cause additional
downward pressure on price in the future. After discussion, the Board determined to continue discussions with Apollo. In addition, the Board
established a committee comprised of Messrs. Kesseler, Thomas C. Freyman, Dennis J. Letham, Aleksandra A. Miziolek, Charles K.
Stevens, III and John S. Stroup (the “Transaction Committee”) for administrative efficiency purposes, with authority to administer, oversee and
act as a resource to management and the advisors with respect to the discussions with Apollo, and also to negotiate and approve the
exclusivity and expense reimbursement letter with Apollo. It was noted that the full Board retained authority with respect to approval of any
proposed sale transaction.
Following the October 19, 2021 Board meeting, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Lazard and Apollo held numerous discussions
regarding the Apollo proposal and the duration and terms of exclusivity and expense reimbursement proposed by Apollo. Apollo proposed
exclusivity through December 31, 2021 and proposed that expense reimbursement would represent 50% of Apollo’s expenses, subject to a
cap on amounts reimbursed to Apollo of $3 million. After discussion with Tenneco management, at the direction of Tenneco management,
representatives of Lazard indicated that Tenneco was willing to move forward with a period of exclusivity until December 15, 2021, subject to
approval of the Transaction Committee.
On October 25, 2021, the Transaction Committee authorized Tenneco to enter into exclusivity with Apollo until December 15, 2021, as well as
expense reimbursement of 50% of Apollo’s out-of-pocket expenses, subject to a cap on amounts reimbursed to Apollo of $3 million.
Also on October 25, 2021, representatives of Apollo sent a supplemental due diligence request list that addressed, among other things,
diligence topics and questions related to financial matters, commercial matters, customers and suppliers, facilities and operations,
separation and carve-out matters, debt and debt-like items and other tax and legal due diligence matters.
On October 26, 2021, Apollo and Tenneco entered into the exclusivity and expense reimbursement letter reflecting the terms approved by the
Transaction Committee.
On November 3 and 4, 2021, the Board held a regular meeting at Tenneco’s headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois attended by Tenneco
management and representatives from Lazard. During the meeting, representatives of Lazard reviewed the current state of the M&A
environment generally and within the automotive sector and provided an
32
Table of Contents
update on discussions with Apollo, including progress since the last Board meeting and an overview of key workstreams to support the
transaction process. In addition, the Lazard representatives reviewed the potential financial impact of the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air to
Tenneco’s remaining business, including Tenneco’s financial profile after completing the potential sale, the potential impact of pension and
other liabilities on net proceeds from a potential transaction, the opportunity to reduce Tenneco’s leverage ratio and the potential market
reaction to the sale transaction.
On November 3, 2021, representatives of Latham had an initial call with representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell”), legal
counsel to Apollo, to discuss process, timing and key workstreams with respect to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Latham and
Wachtell, in certain cases joined by other legal counsel to Tenneco and Apollo, as applicable, had regular communications after this initial
call with respect to additional diligence and legal matters.
On November 9, 2021, Tenneco opened an electronic data room to Apollo and its representatives and financing sources, which was populated
with documentation in response to Apollo’s due diligence requests.
On November 18, 2021, Mr. Kesseler and Mr. Michael Reiss of Apollo attended a dinner together in Chicago. Consistent with prior
discussions Mr. Kesseler had with the Board, Mr. Kesseler communicated to Mr. Reiss over dinner that developing market conditions could
complicate the ability of Tenneco to complete the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction without additional equity financing for the remaining
company. Mr. Reiss suggested that Apollo could consider a potential private equity investment in the remaining company in connection with
consummation of the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction or otherwise could consider a potential purchase of the entire company.
On November 19, 2021, Tenneco’s management and representatives of Lazard held an in-person meeting with representatives of Apollo, joined
by Apollo’s financial, accounting and strategic advisors, at the offices of Latham in Chicago. The Tenneco representatives reviewed the
business, operations and financial position of Powertrain and Clean Air and, in that context, responded to various due diligence questions
posed by Apollo.
On November 21, 2021, in furtherance of the discussions between Mr. Kesseler and Mr. Reiss over dinner on November 18, 2021 regarding a
potential private equity investment in the remaining company in connection with consummation of the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction or
a potential acquisition by the Apollo Funds of all of Tenneco, Apollo requested that Tenneco provide Apollo with business and financial
information regarding the entire company.
During the weeks of November 22, 2021 and November 29, 2021, Tenneco’s management held multiple telephonic and videoconference
diligence sessions with representatives from Apollo, which sessions were also variously attended by Tenneco’s outside advisors from Lazard
and Latham and Apollo’s outside advisors. Tenneco also continued to furnish additional documentation in the virtual data room in response to
Apollo’s supplemental requests.
On November 26, 2021, representatives of Lazard spoke with representatives of Apollo to discuss status and timing, including Apollo’s
request for additional, more detailed diligence information, and Lazard’s request, on behalf of, and at the direction of, Tenneco, that Apollo
confirm its proposed enterprise valuation would be at or above $4 billion for Powertrain and Clean Air. The Apollo representatives indicated
they expected to be in a position to confirm value on or prior to December 15, 2021, assuming Tenneco provided the requested additional
they expected to be in a position to confirm value on or prior to December 15, 2021, assuming Tenneco provided the requested additional
diligence information in a timely manner.
On November 29, 2021, the Transaction Committee held a meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives from Lazard, to
prepare for the special meeting of the Board scheduled for November 30, 2021. During the meeting, Mr. Masanovich provided an update on
current market conditions and changes in the market and business performance in the second half of 2021. Representatives of Lazard
reviewed the strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including pursuing a standalone business strategy, the sale of Powertrain and Clean
Air, the sale of DRiV, the sale of Motorparts and a sale of the whole company. The representatives from Lazard provided an update on the
ongoing discussions between Tenneco and Apollo. It was noted that, based on its work to date, Apollo indicated that it

Table of Contents
would maintain its price range for Powertrain and Clean Air, and that, if necessary, Apollo was willing to consider a potential private equity
investment in the remaining company. Alternatively, it was noted that Apollo had indicated that it would be willing to consider a potential
purchase of the entire company and, in that context, had requested access to business and financial information regarding the entire
company. The Transaction Committee determined to discuss these strategic alternatives with the full Board and noted that, if the Board
sought to broaden the authority of the Transaction Committee to consider a wider range of strategic alternatives, the Board could do so at that
meeting.
On November 30, 2021, the Board held a special meeting attended by Tenneco’s management, as well as representatives from Lazard. During
the meeting, Mr. Masanovich provided an update on current market conditions and changes in the market and business performance in the
second half of 2021, including a decline in global light vehicle production, increased material commodity and freight costs, inflation and a
resulting increase in estimated leverage ratios for Tenneco for 2021 and possibly continuing into 2022. Representatives of Lazard reviewed
with the Board the strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including pursuing a standalone business strategy, the sale of Powertrain and
Clean Air, the sale of DRiV, the sale of Motorparts and a sale of the whole company, and discussed the financial and qualitative
considerations for each transaction alternative, including feasibility, value creation, and, except with respect to a whole company sale, the
leverage profile for the remaining company and growth and margin profile of the remaining company from a public markets perspective. The
Lazard representatives also discussed Tenneco’s capital structure, upcoming maturities, and options for refinancing Tenneco’s indebtedness
in light of the potential sale of Powertrain and Clean Air as compared to the other strategic alternatives. The representatives from Lazard
provided an update on the ongoing discussions between Tenneco and Apollo, noting that, based on its work to date, Apollo indicated that it
would maintain its price range for Powertrain and Clean Air, and that, if necessary, Apollo was willing to consider a potential private equity
investment in the remaining company. Alternatively, it was noted that Apollo had indicated that it would be willing to consider a potential
purchase of the entire company and, in that context, had requested access to business and financial information regarding the entire
company. After discussion, the Board determined to authorize the Transaction Committee to broaden the scope of its review to cover, in
addition to the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air, the potential sale of DRiV or a potential whole company sale transaction. The Board also
authorized management and Lazard to continue discussions with Apollo regarding the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction (including the
potential for a private investment by the Apollo Funds in the remaining company) and also to explore the potential for a whole company
transaction with Apollo.
During the week of December 6, 2021, representatives of Tenneco hosted representatives of Apollo and their outside advisors on six
Powertrain and Clean Air plant tours of Tenneco facilities located in the United States, Germany, and Poland. Also during this week and
continuing into the week of December 13, 2021, Tenneco’s management, together with its financial and legal advisors, held multiple
telephonic and videoconference diligence sessions with representatives from Apollo and its advisors covering financial, legal, tax and other
due diligence matters. In addition, representatives of Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing, the
status of legal diligence and the status of transaction documents for the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air.
On December 9, 2021, representatives of Latham circulated a draft equity purchase agreement to Wachtell with respect to the potential sale
of Powertrain and Clean Air.
On December 10, 2021, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss certain diligence and transaction structuring
matters related to the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air.
Also on December 9, 2021, representatives of Lazard, acting at the direction of the Board, provided representatives of Apollo with a five-year
financial projection scenario for Tenneco on a standalone basis based, in part, upon published IHS Markit Ltd estimates for global light vehicle
production in 2022 through 2026. The projections provided to Apollo were referred to by the Board as the “Upside Case”.
On December 15, 2021, Apollo submitted a letter to Tenneco containing a non-binding indication of interest to acquire 100% of Tenneco for a
price of $16.00 to $18.00 per share of class A common stock in cash. Tenneco’s share price closed at $10.32 per share at the end of trading
that day. Apollo also confirmed its offer for the Apollo Funds to acquire
34
Table of Contents
Powertrain and Clean Air on the same terms originally proposed in October 2021. Apollo’s proposal to acquire the whole company was
subject to completion of due diligence on DRiV (having already substantially completed due diligence on Powertrain and Clean Air) and
negotiation of definitive transaction documentation. Apollo indicated that, because the exclusivity period with Apollo formally expired at 5:00
p.m. Eastern Time on December 15, 2021, Apollo would require a new exclusivity period through the end of January 2022 to move forward with
either its proposal to acquire Powertrain and Clean Air or its proposal to acquire the whole company.
On December 21, 2021, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and
Latham, to review the status of Apollo’s review of the potential acquisition of Powertrain and Clean Air, as well as the non-binding indication of
interest submitted by Apollo and other strategic alternatives available to Tenneco. The parties at the meeting discussed the pro forma leverage
profile of Tenneco, assuming completion of the Powertrain and Clean Air sale transaction, highlighting the estimated net proceeds of the
transaction, the potential challenges of financing Tenneco after the completion of the transaction and the various net leverage profiles resulting
from closing on the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction at different points throughout 2022. The Lazard representatives reviewed the financial
considerations for the potential sale of the whole company, including Tenneco’s preliminary annual operating plan for 2022 and management’s
preliminary five-year financial estimates, key business risks and opportunities for Tenneco, and preliminary illustrative valuation analyses with
respect to Tenneco’s standalone business strategy. Representatives of Lazard also discussed potential alternative strategic and financial
sponsor buyers for Tenneco in an entire company transaction. The Transaction Committee noted the challenges and risks to the remaining
company if Tenneco executed the Powertrain and Clean Air sale transaction and concluded that the Board should consider pursuing the
potential whole company sale alternative with Apollo.
On December 22, 2021, the Board held a special meeting attended by members of Tenneco management and representatives from Lazard
and Latham to review the status of the potential acquisition of Powertrain and Clean Air by the Apollo Funds, as well as the non-binding
indication of interest for the acquisition of the entire company submitted by Apollo and other strategic alternatives available to Tenneco. Mr.
Kesseler provided an update on the potential Powertrain and Clean Air transaction, highlighting the proposed purchase price and various
financial considerations and challenges to the remaining company if Tenneco executed the Powertrain and Clean Air sale transaction. Mr.
Masanovich reviewed the anticipated net proceeds in a Powertrain and Clean Air transaction, including the capital structure challenges
created for the remaining company, the current status of Tenneco’s banking relationships, and the impacts of net leverage of the proposed
sale transaction. The Lazard representatives reviewed the financial considerations for the potential sale of the whole company, including
Tenneco’s preliminary annual operating plan for 2022 and management’s preliminary five-year financial estimates, key business risks and
opportunities for Tenneco, and preliminary illustrative valuation analyses with respect to Tenneco’s standalone business strategy.
Representatives of Lazard also noted Apollo’s request for exclusivity through the end of January 2022 and reviewed other potential alternate
strategic and financial sponsor buyers for Tenneco. Mr. Sabatino and representatives from Latham provided legal advice regarding the fiduciary
duties of the Board. After discussion, the Board determined that Apollo’s offered range of $16.00 to $18.00 per share was inadequate. The
Board directed representatives from Lazard to communicate to Apollo that the Board had determined that a sale of Powertrain and Clean Air
was not likely to be viable in light of the challenges and risks to the remaining company following the sale and that Apollo’s offered range for
whole company transaction was inadequate. It was noted that the Board would reconvene on January 4, 2022 to consider further Tenneco’s
strategic alternatives and, in particular, whether Tenneco would be willing to engage in further discussions with Apollo and on what terms.
On December 23, 2021, representatives of Lazard spoke with representatives of Apollo and conveyed to Apollo that the Board had determined
that a sale of Powertrain and Clean Air was not likely to be viable in light of the challenges and risks to the remaining company following the
sale, and also conveyed that Apollo’s offered range of $16.00 to $18.00 per share for a whole company transaction was inadequate. The
Lazard representatives informed Apollo that the Board would meet again on January 4, 2022, and that the Lazard representatives may be able
to provide more specific feedback on the offer following that meeting.

On January 4, 2022, the Board held a meeting in Chicago attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and Latham to
consider further Tenneco’s strategic alternatives and, in particular, whether Tenneco would be willing to engage in further discussions with
Apollo and on what terms. Representatives of Latham provided legal advice regarding the fiduciary duties of the Board. Representatives of
Lazard reviewed the Board’s extended process to explore strategic alternatives for Tenneco, stretching back to the announcement of the
Federal-Mogul acquisition, and the desire to separate DRiV and Powertrain Technologies. No standstill provisions remained in effect at the
time with any third party other than Apollo, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no standstill provisions currently remain in effect with any third
party. Messrs. Kesseler, Masanovich and Richard M. Kwas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development, reviewed the
current market conditions in the auto industry, including increased volatility as a result of inflation, supply chain issues and general market
trends, and they noted the impact on the expected leverage profile and financial position of the remaining company if the Board were to
proceed with the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air. Tenneco management then presented various five-year financial projection scenarios for
Tenneco on a standalone basis, including the “Upside Case” that had been furnished to Apollo on December 9, 2021, and that was based, in
part, upon published IHS Markit Ltd estimates for global light vehicle production in 2022 through 2026, and a so-called “Base Case” reflecting,
among other things, management’s estimates for global light vehicle production in 2022 through 2026. See “— Certain Financial Projections”
on page 53 of this proxy statement for summaries of the Upside Case furnished to Apollo and the Base Case authorized by the Board for use
by Lazard in its financial valuation analyses.
Representatives from Lazard then reviewed the potential risks and opportunities of various strategic alternatives available to Tenneco,
highlighting the challenges posed by the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air. The Board determined that neither the sale of Powertrain and Clean
Air nor the sale of DRiV was actionable at that time for the various reasons previously discussed. The Board then discussed the whole
company sale of Tenneco as the alternative most likely to maximize value for Tenneco and its stockholders, as compared to continuing to
execute Tenneco’s strategic plan on a standalone basis. Mr. Kesseler and the Lazard representatives referenced Apollo’s request for
exclusivity and reviewed other potential alternate strategic and financial sponsor buyers for Tenneco. Representatives of Lazard reviewed prior
marketing efforts for Tenneco’s business segments, and following discussion with management and taking into account advice from
representatives of Lazard and the fact that Tenneco had not received any outreach from third parties in response to Tenneco’s public
announcements of its strategic review process, the Board believed it was unlikely that another strategic or private equity bidder would be
willing to offer a purchase price for Tenneco in excess of the current Apollo proposal. The Board also discussed the range of approaches to
“test the market” for a sale of the company, including potential targeted pre-signing outreach to potential bidders, a so-called “go-shop” to
allow Tenneco to solicit proposals after signing the proposed transaction with the Apollo Funds and a so-called “window shop” that would
allow the Board to consider and respond to unsolicited proposals received after signing the proposed transaction with the Apollo Funds. After
discussion, the Board instructed management and Lazard to advise Apollo that Apollo would need to increase its per share offer price for the
whole company to be “in the twenties” and be reflective of the 52-week high in Tenneco’s stock of $22.27 in order to move forward with further
discussions regarding the proposed whole company sale transaction and that the Board would request that the definitive transaction
documentation include a customary “go-shop” provision in the context of extending the exclusivity period for Apollo. The Board also
determined that discussions and negotiations with respect to the potential sale of Tenneco would be administered at the full Board level and,
accordingly, the Transaction Committee was disbanded.
Later on during the afternoon of January 4, 2022, representatives of Lazard contacted representatives of Apollo to communicate that the
proposed range of $16.00 to $18.00 per share was inadequate and that Apollo would need to increase its per share offer price for the whole
company to be “in the twenties” and be reflective of the 52-week high in Tenneco’s stock of $22.27 in order to move forward with further
discussions. Mr. Kesseler subsequently spoke with the Apollo representative to reiterate the Board’s position. Mr. Kesseler also noted that
the Board would request a “go-shop” provision in the definitive transaction documentation in recognition of the exclusivity period granted to
Apollo.
On January 5, 2022, representatives of Apollo contacted Mr. Kesseler and representatives of Lazard to convey Apollo’s revised non-binding
proposal to acquire Tenneco for $20.00 per share in cash, representing a 57% premium over

Table of Contents
Tenneco’s then-current share price, subject to the completion of diligence, execution of definitive agreements and extension of Apollo’s
exclusivity period. Apollo’s representative indicated that the $20 per share price represented the upper limit of what Apollo was authorized to
pay in an acquisition of Tenneco. Apollo also indicated that Apollo believed it could complete due diligence and be in a position to sign
definitive documentation by February 24, 2022. Apollo’s representatives acknowledged the Board’s request for a “go-shop” provision but
indicated that it would be discussed in connection with definitive transaction documentation. Apollo subsequently furnished its revised non-
binding proposal in writing for consideration by Tenneco’s Board.
On January 7, 2022, the Board held a special meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and Latham, to review
Apollo’s revised offer of $20.00 per share in cash and its request for exclusivity. Mr. Sabatino and representatives from Latham provided legal
advice regarding the fiduciary duties of the Board. Representatives from Lazard reviewed the financial aspects of Apollo’s revised proposal.
The Board discussed that Apollo continued to be the party most likely to offer the highest value for Tenneco, that the pool of other potential
bidders was expected to be limited given current and prospective market trends, and that Tenneco had publicly announced that it was
reviewing strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, but had not received any outreach from third parties in response. The Board
authorized management and the advisors to continue discussions with Apollo on the basis of its revised offer, including an extension of
exclusivity to Apollo through February 21, 2022, in order to be in a position to consider definitive documentation prior to Tenneco’s regularly
scheduled earnings call.
After the Board meeting on January 7, 2022, representatives of Lazard communicated to Apollo that Tenneco was prepared to extend
exclusivity for purposes of negotiating a whole company transaction through February 21, 2022 based upon Apollo’s non-binding proposal of
$20 per share, and Tenneco and Apollo executed an exclusivity agreement extension on that basis. Later that day, representatives from
Apollo sent a business due diligence request list to Lazard, requesting customary business and financial data to allow Apollo to assess its
valuation assumptions with respect to Motorparts and Performance Solutions as well as confirmatory diligence items for their diligence with
respect to legal, environmental, health and safety, insurance, intellectual property and other similar matters.
Also on January 7, 2022 and thereafter on a regular basis, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss
transaction process and timing for the whole company transaction, the status of legal diligence and open items in the negotiation of definitive
transaction documents.
On or around January 10, 2022, representatives of Lazard provided Tenneco with a customary memorandum disclosing certain of Lazard’s
then-current and historical relationships with Apollo and its affiliates.
During January and February 2022, Tenneco also consulted with representatives of J.P. Morgan, a financial advisor to the Company, regarding
the financial condition and business of Tenneco, as well as the financial aspects of the proposed transaction with the Apollo Funds.
On January 18, 2022, Tenneco held a management meeting in Detroit, Michigan, covering Motorparts and Performance Solutions (formerly
Ride Performance) with representatives from Apollo, which was also attended by representatives from Lazard and Latham.
During the week of January 24, 2022 and continuing into February 2022, Tenneco’s management, together with representatives of Lazard and
Latham, held multiple telephonic and videoconference diligence sessions with representatives from Apollo, including Apollo’s outside advisors,
covering tax, information technology, cybersecurity, environmental, legal and financial matters. From January 24, 2022 through February 4,
2022, members of Tenneco’s management hosted representatives of Apollo and its outside advisors on six Performance Solutions and
Motorparts plant tours of Tenneco facilities located in the United States, Mexico, Poland, Romania and Belgium.
On January 26, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss various legal issues, including the status of
legal diligence and key points for the definitive transaction documentation. Later that day, Latham sent an initial draft of the proposed Merger
Agreement to Wachtell. Among other terms, the agreement
Tenneco Inc.
37
2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting
Table of Contents
included a 45-day “go-shop” period, a “two-tiered” Tenneco termination fee with a lower termination fee of 1.25% of Tenneco’s equity value
payable if the agreement were terminated by Tenneco to accept a superior proposal during the “go-shop” period (as well as after the “go-shop”
period for certain exempted persons who approached the Company during the “go-shop” period) and a termination fee of 2.5% of Tenneco’s
equity value after the “go-shop” period. The proposed Merger Agreement also contemplated that Parent, Tenneco and their respective affiliates
would be required to divest assets, pursue litigation and take certain other actions, if necessary, to obtain antitrust and other regulatory
approvals (a so-called “hell or high water” regulatory approvals provision), that Parent and its affiliates would not be permitted to engage in
mergers or acquisitions prior to closing if such activity could materially delay closing or increase the risk of not obtaining any required
regulatory approval and that Parent would be obligated to pay a reverse termination fee of 4% of the enterprise value of Tenneco if the Merger
Agreement were terminated due to Parent’s failure to consummate the Merger when required to do so under the Merger Agreement.
On January 29, 2022, the senior management of Motorparts and Performance Solutions and representatives of Lazard held an additional
videoconference diligence session with representatives from Apollo, including Apollo’s outside advisors, regarding Motorparts and
Performance Solutions. Also on January 29, 2022, Tenneco executed an engagement letter with Lazard in connection with the proposed sale
of Tenneco.
On February 1 and 2, 2022, the Board held a regular meeting at Tenneco’s headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois attended by Tenneco
management and representatives of Lazard and Latham. During the meeting, the Lazard representatives provided an update on diligence and
the potential whole company sale to the Apollo Funds and provided a review of market conditions and the M&A landscape, highlighting recent
market performance for the automotive sector. Representatives of Latham then reviewed the current status of legal discussions with Wachtell,
as well as the anticipated transaction timeline. It was noted that Apollo had objected to the Board’s request for a “go-shop” provision, citing
the substantial premium proposed by Apollo and Tenneco’s prior public announcements that the Board was open to reviewing strategic
alternatives. The Board discussed that Apollo continued to be the party most likely to offer the highest value for Tenneco and that the pool of
other potential bidders was expected to be limited given current and prospective market trends. The Board authorized management and the
advisors to continue discussions with Apollo regarding a potential whole company transaction.
Also on February 1 and 2, 2022, members of Tenneco’s management team covering Motorparts and Performance Solutions met with Apollo’s
accounting and strategic advisors at Tenneco’s offices in Southfield, Michigan to discuss quality of earnings diligence.
On February 2, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing, the status of
legal diligence and key business issues related to the draft Merger Agreement provided by Latham. Later in the day on February 2, 2022,
Wachtell sent Latham a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft of the Merger Agreement removed the “go-shop” provisions,
replaced the “hell or high water” regulatory efforts provision with a provision stating that Parent would not be required to make any divestitures,
agree to regulatory remedies or commence any litigation in order to obtain required antitrust and regulatory approvals, removed the restriction
on Parent’s and its affiliates’ ability to pursue mergers and acquisitions prior to consummation of the Merger, increased Tenneco’s termination
fee to 3.5% of Tenneco’s equity value, and lowered Parent’s reverse termination fee to 3.5% of Tenneco’s equity value. Wachtell’s draft also
added a requirement for Tenneco to reimburse Parent for its deal-related expenses in the event that Tenneco’s stockholders did not vote to
approve the transaction at the stockholder meeting (regardless of whether the Board changed its recommendation or whether a competing
transaction had then been publicly announced).
On February 4 and 7, 2022, members of Tenneco’s management met with Apollo’s accounting and strategic advisors in Detroit, Michigan to
discuss various due diligence matters.
On February 9, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing, the status of
legal diligence and open items in the negotiation of the Merger Agreement. Later in the day on February 9, 2022, Latham sent Wachtell a
revised draft of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft of the Merger
38
Table of Contents
Agreement reinserted Tenneco’s initial positions on the “go-shop”, “two-tiered” Tenneco termination fee and the antitrust and regulatory efforts
provisions. The revised draft Merger Agreement also proposed a Parent termination fee equal to 4% of Tenneco’s enterprise value, and deleted
the requirement for Tenneco to reimburse Parent for its expenses in connection with the transaction in the event that Tenneco’s stockholder
did not vote to approve the Merger.
On February 14, 2022, Wachtell sent Latham a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft of the Merger Agreement made the
same edits as Apollo’s prior draft of the Merger Agreement with respect to the deletion of the “go-shop” provisions, Tenneco’s termination fee
of 3.5% of Tenneco’s equity value, the antitrust and regulatory efforts provisions and Tenneco’s obligation to reimburse Apollo’s expenses
upon Tenneco stockholders voting down the Merger (but added an upper limit of $20 million on this reimbursement obligation). The draft
Merger Agreement from Wachtell also proposed a termination fee payable by Parent of 4.5% of Tenneco’s equity value. Wachtell’s draft
Merger Agreement also modified the restriction on Parent’s and its affiliates’ ability to pursue mergers and acquisition prior to closing to only
restrict activities that would be reasonably expected to prevent the consummation of the Merger prior to the “outside date” specified in the
Merger Agreement.
On February 16, 2022, Latham sent Wachtell a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft required that Apollo only agree to
divestitures of, and regulatory remedies with respect to, Tenneco’s businesses and assets (and not assets of any affiliates of Parent). The
revised draft also reinserted Tenneco’s prior position on the “go-shop”, Tenneco termination fees, Parent termination fee and Apollo’s expense
reimbursement proposal.
On February 18, 2022, the Board held a regular meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and Latham. During
the meeting, the Lazard representatives reviewed the history of the proposed transaction, an overview of due diligence and recent meetings
with representatives of Apollo, valuation and implied multiples of Apollo’s proposal and current assumptions regarding the global light vehicle
market. The Lazard representatives also reviewed Lazard’s financial valuation analyses with respect to Tenneco using customary
methodologies, including discounted cash flow, a private market valuation and a public market valuation based on both the Base Case
projections (as discussed in “ — Certain Financial Projections” on page 53 of this proxy statement) and consensus estimates. The Lazard
representatives further contextualized Apollo’s offer by comparing it to Tenneco’s 52-week high of $22.27 per share and 52-week low of $9.65
per share and addressed the approximately $7.1 billion enterprise value of Tenneco implied by Apollo’s offer. Representatives of Lazard also
discussed current market trends and other potential buyers, noting the lack of outreach from third parties in response to Tenneco’s public
announcements of its strategic review processes. Representatives of Latham then provided a status update on the negotiation of the proposed
Merger Agreement, highlighting key terms and open business items, and received feedback from the Board with respect to those matters.
Representatives of Latham also discussed applicable merger control and foreign direct investment approvals. The Board authorized
management and the advisors to continue discussions with Apollo regarding the Merger.
Separately, on February 18, 2022, Wachtell sent Latham a partially revised draft of the Merger Agreement reserving on the most significant
open business points and advancing legal and technical drafting matters that were previously unresolved in the Merger Agreement.
On February 19, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing and walk
through the revisions in the draft of the Merger Agreement that Wachtell sent to Latham the prior day. Later in the day, Latham sent a revised
incremental draft of the Merger Agreement to Wachtell, again reserving on the most significant open business points.
On February 20, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing and walk
through the revisions in the draft of the Merger Agreement that Latham sent to Wachtell the prior day.
On February 21, 2022, at the direction of Tenneco, representatives of Lazard spoke with Apollo regarding the significant open business issues
in the Merger Agreement, focusing on the Board’s request for a “go-shop” provision, antitrust and regulatory considerations and termination
fees and expense reimbursement obligations of the parties.

Later in the day on February 21, 2022, the Board held a special meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and
Latham. Representatives from Latham reviewed the open business issues in the proposed Merger Agreement and Latham and Lazard
responded to questions and comments from the Board. The Board provided guidance on the remaining open business issues in the Merger
Agreement and authorized management and its advisors to continue discussions with Apollo regarding the Merger. Mr. Kesseler advised that
the Board would reconvene on February 22, 2022 to review the proposed final Merger Agreement in detail, assuming Apollo and Company
management could reach agreement on final terms.
Following the Board meeting on February 21, 2022, Mr. Kesseler spoke with a representative of Apollo regarding the remaining open business
issues in the Merger Agreement. They agreed that Tenneco would accept removal of the “go-shop” provision in the final Merger Agreement in
exchange for Apollo’s agreement (i) to make divestitures and accept remedies to obtain applicable regulatory and antitrust approvals so long
as it would not result in a material adverse effect on Tenneco and its subsidiaries, (ii) to a Parent termination fee of approximately 6.0% of
Tenneco’s equity value and a Tenneco termination fee of approximately 3.0% of Tenneco’s’ equity value and (iii) to forgo expense
reimbursement if Company stockholders vote down the Merger.
On February 22, 2022, Wachtell sent Latham a revised draft of the Merger Agreement reflecting the negotiation between the parties of the
previously open business points. The revised draft of the Merger Agreement modified the antitrust and regulatory efforts provisions to require
Parent to divest assets of Tenneco and its subsidiaries (and agree to remedies with respect thereto) and pursue litigation, in each case, if
necessary to obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals, except to the extent such actions would have or reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of Tenneco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The revised draft
also removed the “go-shop” provision, reduced the Tenneco termination fee to $54,000,000 (approximately 3.0% of transaction equity value)
and increased the Parent termination fee to $108,000,000 (approximately 6.0% of transaction equity value). The revised draft also provided
that the $108,000,000 Parent termination fee would be payable in the event that certain closing conditions related to regulatory approvals were
not satisfied prior to the “outside date” where all other closing conditions were satisfied (provided that Parent would retain the right to waive
such unsatisfied conditions and consummate the Merger rather than paying a termination fee). The revised draft accepted the removal of
Tenneco’s obligation to reimburse Parent for its expenses in connection with the transaction in the event that Tenneco’s stockholders do not
vote to approve the Merger at the stockholder meeting. Over the remainder of the day on February 22, 2022, Latham and Wachtell traded
further drafts of the Merger Agreement, making technical final revisions.
Later in the day on February 22, 2022, the Board held a special meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and
Latham. During the meeting, representatives from Latham reviewed the proposed resolution of the key business points discussed with the
Board on February 21, 2022, the final terms of the Merger Agreement, the transaction timeline, and conditions and contingencies. The
Latham representatives also provided legal advice regarding the Board’s fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the context of the proposed
transaction and regarding a proposed amendment to Tenneco’s bylaws to designate specified courts as the exclusive forum for certain types
of litigation relating to Tenneco. Representatives of Lazard then reviewed Lazard’s financial analyses and delivered its oral opinion to the Board
(which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of February 22, 2022) to the effect that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the consideration to be paid to Tenneco’s stockholders (other than
with respect to shares of Tenneco’s class A common stock held by holders who are entitled to, and have properly demanded, an appraisal of
their shares and shares held by Tenneco as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub (or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries of Parent)) in the Merger was fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders. Following this discussion, the Board
unanimously (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in
the best interests of Tenneco and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Tenneco for adoption,
(iv) recommended that Tenneco’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and (v) adopted the amendment to Tenneco’s bylaws designating
specified courts as the exclusive forum for certain types of litigation.

Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
The Board, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and reviewing and considering various factors described in “—
Reasons for the Merger,” (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair
to and in the best interests of Tenneco and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Tenneco
for adoption and (iv) recommended that Tenneco’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.
Reasons for the Merger
At a meeting of our Board on February 22, 2022, our Board (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Tenneco and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared
advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be
submitted to the stockholders of Tenneco for adoption and (iv) recommended that Tenneco’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by
Tenneco’s stockholders, the Board evaluated the Merger Agreement and the Merger with Tenneco’s executive management and Tenneco’s
financial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors (which are not intended to be
exhaustive or listed in any relative order of importance):
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium of 100.4% to Tenneco’s closing stock price on February 22, 2022, the last
trading day before the Merger Agreement was announced, and a premium of 71.6% over the 90-day volume-weighted average on the
same date;
•
uncertainties associated with the long-term risks and challenges in continuing to implement Tenneco’s strategic plan, including strategic
business and execution risks in light of the transformational changes and realignments expected in the automotive industry resulting from
the growing adoption of battery electric vehicles;
•
the Board’s belief that the value offered to stockholders pursuant to the Merger is more favorable to Tenneco’s stockholders than the
potential value from other alternatives reasonably available to Tenneco, including remaining an independent public company and the sale
or other disposition of DRiV and/or our Powertrain, Systems Protection, Clean Air or other business units, after reviewing Tenneco’s
business, financial condition, results of operations, market trends, competitive landscape and execution risks, and discussions with
Tenneco’s management and advisors and considering:
•
increased volatility and uncertain outlook in the automotive industry driven by:
increasingly rapid adoption of battery electric vehicles, particularly in Tenneco’s most important markets, and the resulting impact
on the market for internal combustion engines;
supply chain issues and the ongoing global semiconductor shortage;
the emergence of increased inflation as a possible risk to light vehicle demand and production;
high fixed costs;
Tenneco Inc.
41
2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents
timing and uncertainty as to the strength of the macroeconomic recovery from COVID-related supply chain disruption; and
increasing material commodity and freight costs;
•
the potential for Tenneco’s high financial leverage relative to its peers to exacerbate the effect of negative industry factors and make
it more difficult for Tenneco to make the necessary investments to react to such factors;
•
the impact of increasing multiple compression on the valuations of auto supplier with higher powertrain content;
•
the continued cyclicality of the automotive industry;
•
the significant amount of Tenneco’s debt that would likely need to be refinanced in the near- to medium-term;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration of $20.00 per share will be paid in cash, and provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to
Tenneco’s stockholders, enabling them to realize value for their interest in Tenneco while eliminating business and execution risk inherent
in Tenneco’s business, including risks and uncertainties associated with achievement of the stand-alone plan;
•
Tenneco’s review of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value dating back to 2019, including our exploration of a potential spin-
off of DRiV, our public announcement of ongoing review of strategic alternatives in January 2020, and our outreach to, and extensive
discussions with, potentially interested parties regarding a sale or other disposition of our Powertrain, Systems Protection, Clean Air or
other business units (as further described in the section titled “— Background of the Merger”);
•
our ability to respond to and negotiate an alternative acquisition proposal from a third party if such proposal is determined to constitute or
would be reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; the Board’s ability to change its recommendation in accordance with the
customary fiduciary out provisions; and our ability to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal with the payment of a
customary termination fee, which termination fee amount the Board believes to be reasonable under the circumstances given the size of
the transaction, our leverage position and taking into account the range of such termination fees in similar transactions and believes will
not preclude or substantially impede a possible competing proposal;
•
the belief of the Board, based upon arm’s length negotiations, including Parent’s increase in its proposed price per share to $20.00 (as
further described in the section titled “— Background of the Merger”), that the price to be paid by Parent was the highest price per share
that Parent was willing to pay for Tenneco;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement was the product of arm’s length negotiations and contained terms and conditions that were, in the
Board’s view, advisable and favorable to Tenneco and its stockholders, as well as the Board’s belief, based on these negotiations, that
these were the most favorable terms available to Tenneco and its stockholders on which Parent was willing to transact;
•
the business reputation and capabilities of the Apollo Funds and their ability to complete the Merger;
•
the Board’s belief that Parent has access to the resources needed to complete the Merger, based on, among other factors, that Parent
has obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from reputable financial institutions and committed equity financing from the
Sponsors (as defined below), and that Parent had agreed to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the debt financing and the equity
financing in accordance with their respective terms;
•
the financial presentation and oral opinion delivered by Lazard to the Board on February 22, 2022, which was confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion, dated February 22, 2022, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions
set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to Tenneco’s stockholders (other than with respect to shares of Tenneco’s class A
common stock held by holders who are entitled to, and have properly demanded, an appraisal of their shares and shares held by Tenneco
as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub (or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Merger Sub)) in the
Merger was fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders. The Lazard opinion is more fully described
42
Table of Contents
in “— Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC” and the full text of the Lazard opinion is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B;
•
the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated, based upon, among other things, the limited number of conditions to the Merger, the
absence of a financing condition, the likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals and contractual commitments by Parent to
obtain such regulatory approvals and the remedies available under the Merger Agreement to Tenneco in the event of any breaches by
Parent; and
•
the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including, among others, the following:
•
the customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Tenneco in the Merger Agreement;
•
the ability of the Board, subject to certain limitations, to respond to a bona fide unsolicited acquisition proposal received from a third
party prior to obtaining the stockholder approval if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the acquisition proposal constitutes or would be reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal;
•
the ability of the Board, subject to certain limitations, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that stockholders vote in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement in connection with the receipt of a superior proposal or the occurrence of an intervening event,
and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
superior proposal, subject to payment to Parent of a termination fee if the Board in good faith (after consultation with its financial
and legal advisors) determines that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
•
the conclusion of the Board that the termination fee and the circumstances in which such termination fee may be payable are
reasonable in light of the benefit of the Merger and would not be a significant impediment to third parties interested in making an
acquisition proposal;
•
the fact that Parent and Merger Sub agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approval for the Merger under
applicable competition laws and, to the extent necessary to obtain such approvals, to pursue litigation and divest assets of Tenneco
and its subsidiaries, except to the extent such actions would have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations or financial condition of Tenneco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger;
•
the absence of a financing condition to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger;
•
the fact that Parent has received an equity commitment letters from the Sponsors, which will provide sufficient funds for Parent,
together with the proceeds of the debt financing, to consummate the Merger;
•
the fact that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to certain limitations, Tenneco is entitled to specific performance and
other equitable remedies to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, may enforce Parent’s
obligation to cause the equity financing to be timely completed;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement provides that, if the Merger is not consummated under certain specified circumstances, Parent
will pay Tenneco a reverse termination fee of $108,000,000, and that the aggregate amount of such payment obligation is
guaranteed by the Sponsors;
•
the fact that the Outside Date (as it may be extended) under the Merger Agreement is intended to allow for sufficient time to
complete the Merger; and
•
the availability of statutory appraisal rights to Tenneco stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and who otherwise comply with all required procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL.
The Board also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors with respect to the Merger Agreement and
the Merger, including, among others, the following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):
•
the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on our soliciting competing proposals to acquire Tenneco;
Tenneco Inc.
43
2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting
Table of Contents
•
the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on Tenneco’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in connection with the receipt of a
superior proposal, including the fact that the Board must (i) provide three business days’ written notice to Parent of its intention to
effect a change of board recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in order to provide Parent with an opportunity to match
a superior proposal (and a further two business days’ written notice with respect to any subsequent material modifications to any
such superior proposal) and (ii) negotiate in good faith with Parent during such period, and the discouraging effect such restrictions
may have on other potential bidders;
•
the fact that, under certain circumstances, including the termination of the Merger Agreement by Tenneco to accept a superior
proposal, the termination of the Merger Agreement by Parent following a change in recommendation by the Board, and other
customary circumstances, Tenneco would be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $54 million, and the potential effect of such
termination fee to deter other potential bidders from making an acquisition proposal for Tenneco;
•
the fact that Tenneco stockholders will not participate in any potential future earnings or growth of Tenneco and will not benefit from
any appreciation in its value as a private company;
•
the risk that the conditions to the consummation of the Merger may not be satisfied and, as a result, the possibility that the Merger
may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Tenneco’s stockholders;
•
the potential negative effects if the Merger is not consummated, including:
the trading price of Tenneco class A common stock could be adversely affected;
we will have incurred significant transaction and opportunity costs attempting to complete the Merger;

After taking into account the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger to
Tenneco’s stockholders outweighed the potentially negative factors associated with the Merger. Accordingly, the Board determined that the
Merger Agreement and the Merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Tenneco and its stockholders and unanimously
recommends that the stockholders of Tenneco adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger.
The foregoing discussion summarizes the material factors considered by the Board, but is not intended to be exhaustive. In light of the
variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Moreover, each
member of the Board applied his or her own business judgment to the process and may have given different weight to different factors. The
Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did
not support its ultimate determination and recommendation. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information
presented, including its discussions with, and questioning of, Tenneco’s executive management and its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel. This explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and
should be read in light of the factors set forth in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 25 of this proxy
statement.

TENNECO INC_20220426_DEFM14A_20034100_4448087.Pdf,Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC,"Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC
The Company has retained Lazard to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. In connection with this engagement, the
Company requested that Lazard evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company common stock (other than holders
of Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders in the Merger. On February 22, 2022, at a meeting of the Board
held to evaluate the Merger Agreement and the Merger, Lazard rendered to the Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated February 22, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken described in such opinion, the Merger Consideration
to be paid to holders of Company common stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders.
The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated February 22, 2022, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Appendix B and is incorporated by reference in this
document. The summary of the written opinion of Lazard, dated February 22, 2022, set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of Lazard’s opinion attached as Appendix B. Lazard’s opinion was for the benefit of the
Board (in its capacity as such) and Lazard’s opinion was rendered to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger
and did not address any terms or other aspects (other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard’s
opinion) of the Merger. Lazard’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction
or business strategy in which the Company might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in
the Merger. Lazard’s opinion is not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any matter relating thereto.
In connection with its opinion, Lazard, among other things:
•
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated February 22, 2022 of the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to the Company;
•
reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to Lazard by the Company relating to the business of the Company, including
financial forecasts identified as the “Base Case” prepared by management of the Company;
•
held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company with respect to the business and prospects of the Company;

•
reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business that Lazard believed to be generally relevant in
evaluating the business of the Company;
•
reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business that Lazard believed to be
generally relevant in evaluating the business of the Company;
•
reviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Company common stock; and
•
conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Lazard deemed appropriate.
Lazard assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent verification of such
information. Lazard did not conduct any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the
Company or concerning the solvency or fair value of the Company, and Lazard was not furnished with any such valuation or appraisal.
Management of the Company advised Lazard that the Base Case best reflected the anticipated future financial performance of the Company
and, accordingly, at the direction of the Board, Lazard utilized the Base Case projections for purposes of its analyses in connection with its
opinion. With respect to the financial forecasts utilized in Lazard’s analyses, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Company, that they
had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance
of the Company. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions on which they are
based.
Further, Lazard’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to Lazard as of, the date of its opinion. Lazard assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on
circumstances or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Lazard did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of
Company common stock may trade at any time subsequent to the announcement of the Merger. In connection with Lazard’s engagement,
Lazard was authorized to solicit indications of interest from third parties with respect to a potential transaction involving a portion of the
Company and was not authorized to, and did not, solicit indications of interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction involving the
whole Company. In addition, Lazard’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction or
business strategy in which the Company might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger.
In rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Board, that the Merger will be consummated on the terms described in the
Merger Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any terms or conditions that would be material to Lazard’s analyses.
Representatives of the Company advised Lazard, and Lazard assumed, that the Merger Agreement, when executed, would conform to the
draft reviewed by Lazard in all material respects. Lazard also assumed, with the consent of the Board, that obtaining the necessary
governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the Merger will not have an adverse effect on the Company or the Merger
that would be material to Lazard’s analyses. Lazard did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from
the Merger, nor did Lazard’s opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Lazard understood that the
Company obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or
other aspects (other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard’s opinion) of the Merger, including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Merger or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the
Merger. In addition, Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger
Consideration or otherwise.
Summary of the Financial Analyses of the Company’s Financial Advisor
In preparing its opinion to the Board, Lazard performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The summary set forth below does not
purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying Lazard’s opinion, nor does
the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses. The preparation of a
financial opinion or analysis is a complex
46
Table of Contents
process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion or analysis is not readily susceptible to summary description. In
arriving at its opinion, Lazard considered the results of all of the analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in
isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any particular factor or method of analysis considered by it. Rather, Lazard made its
determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.
Accordingly, Lazard believes that its analyses and factors summarized below must be considered as a whole and in context. Lazard further
believes that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion.
In performing its analyses, Lazard considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. No company, business or transaction
reviewed is identical or directly comparable to the Company or its business or the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of these analyses is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning business, financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions
reviewed or views regarding the comparability of such companies, businesses or transactions. Accordingly, such analyses may not
necessarily include all companies, businesses or transactions that could be deemed relevant. The estimates of the future performance of the
Company in or underlying Lazard’s analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those
suggested by the analyses. These estimates are necessarily subject to uncertainty because, among other things, they are based upon
numerous factors and events beyond the control of Tenneco and its advisors. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or
securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company may actually be sold or the prices at which any
securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the ranges of
valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken as
the views of Lazard regarding the actual values of the Company. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the
extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 18, 2022, and is not necessarily indicative
of current market conditions.
Lazard did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the Merger. The type and amount
of Merger Consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between the Company and Apollo Global Management,
Inc., rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of
the Board. Lazard’s opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the Merger and the
Merger Consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or management with respect to the Merger or the
Merger Consideration payable in the Merger.
Financial Analyses
The summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled “—Financial Analyses” is a summary of the material
financial analyses provided by Lazard in connection with its opinion, dated February 22, 2022, to the Board. The summary set
forth below is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion, nor does the
order of the analyses in the summary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The
financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Lazard’s
financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses performed by Lazard. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Lazard. Future results may differ
from those described and such differences may be material.

Comparable Public Companies Analysis
Using public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard compared certain financial information of the Company to corresponding
financial information for selected publicly traded companies that, based on Lazard’s professional judgment and experience, Lazard considered
generally relevant for purposes of analysis. The selected companies used in this analysis were as follows:

Lazard selected the companies above because, among other things, the selected companies operate businesses similar in certain respects
to the business of the Company. However, none of the selected companies is identical to the Company and certain of these companies may
have characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard
believes that purely quantitative analyses are not, in isolation, determinative in the context of the Merger Consideration and that qualitative
judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of the Company and the
selected companies that could affect the public trading values of each company are also relevant.
For each selected company, Lazard calculated its enterprise value (defined as equity market value, plus debt, underfunded pension and other
post-employment benefits obligations, preferred stock and minority interests, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of its estimated
EBITDA (defined as estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of pensions and other
post-employment benefits) for calendar year 2022 (“EV / 2022 EBITDA”). The median EV / 2022 EBITDA multiple observed for the Non-
Powertrain Peers, the Powertrain Peers and the Aftermarket Peers was 6.9x, 5.3x and 7.4x, respectively.

Table of Contents
Using its professional judgment and experience, Lazard applied a range of multiples of estimated EV / 2022 EBITDA, derived from the EV /
2022 EBITDA multiples of the selected companies, of 4.0x to 5.0x, to the Company’s estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2022. This analysis
resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Company common stock of $0.00 to $10.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as
compared to the implied per share Merger Consideration of $20.00. Lazard noted that applying a 4.0x EV / 2022 EBITDA multiple to the
Company’s estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2022 would result in a negative equity value and $0.00 per share represents a 4.3x EV / 2022
EBITDA multiple. Lazard also applied these calculations utilizing selected Wall Street equity analysts’ consensus estimates for the Company
in lieu of the forecasts provided by the Company’s management. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of
Company common stock of $9.70 to $27.60 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied per share Merger Consideration of
$20.00.

Precedent Transactions Analysis
Lazard reviewed and analyzed, to the extent publicly available, financial information for selected precedent transactions involving (i) OE
suppliers and (ii) companies in the aftermarket sector, that Lazard believed, based on its experience and professional judgment, to be
generally relevant for purposes of this analysis. Although none of the selected precedent transactions or the companies party to such
transactions is directly comparable to the Merger or to the Company, the selected precedent transactions were chosen because certain
aspects of the transactions, for purposes of this analysis and based on the professional judgment and experience of Lazard, may be
considered similar to the Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial
and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect
the Merger. The selected precedent transactions reviewed were:

For each of the selected precedent transactions, Lazard reviewed the enterprise value of the target company implied by the selected
transaction as a multiple of the target company’s EBITDA for the 12 months preceding the announcement date (“EV / LTM EBITDA”). The
mean EV / LTM EBITDA multiple observed for the selected OE Supplier transactions was 6.5x. The mean EV / LTM EBITDA multiple
observed for the selected aftermarket sector transactions was 8.6x. Lazard noted that public financial information was unavailable for certain
of the transactions and such transactions were excluded from the calculations. Lazard applied a range of EV / LTM EBITDA multiples of 5.0x
to 6.0x derived from the selected precedent transactions to the Company’s 2021 EBITDA. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity
value per share of Company common stock of $11.30 to $25.90 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied per share Merger
Consideration of $20.00.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company by calculating, based on the Base Case projections provided by the
Company’s management, the estimated present value (as of December 31, 2021) of the stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that
the Company was forecasted to generate during calendar years 2022 through 2026. Lazard also calculated a range of implied terminal values
for the Company by applying a selected range of exit EBITDA multiples of 4.0x to 5.0x to the Company’s estimated EBITDA for calendar year
2026, which range of exit EBITDA multiples was selected based on Lazard’s professional judgment and experience, taking into account,
among other things, the trading multiples of selected publicly traded companies, the forecasts provided by the Company’s management and
trends in the overall economy generally and in the industries and sectors in which the Company operates. The cash flows and range of
implied terminal values were then discounted to present value (as of December 31, 2021) using a selected range of discount rates of 10.5% to
11.5% derived based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation.
This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Company common stock of $15.15 to $29.00 (rounded to the nearest
$0.05), as compared to the implied per share Merger Consideration of $20.00.

Other Analyses
Lazard observed certain additional information that was not considered part of its financial analyses for its opinion but was noted for
informational reference for the Board, including the following:
Leveraged Buyout Return Analysis
Lazard performed a leveraged buyout return analysis based on the Base Case projections provided by management of the Company, to
determine the range of prices per share of Company common stock a financial buyer would be willing to pay to acquire the Company on a
stand-alone basis with an illustrative capital structure that Lazard deemed to be achievable in the current market. For purpose of this
analysis, Lazard assumed a five-year investment period, target internal rates of return ranging from 15% to 20%, total leverage at closing of
4.2x 2021 EBITDA and an exit multiple of 4.0x to 5.0x. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Company
common stock of $11.10 to $22.50 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied per share Merger Consideration of $20.00.
52-Week Trading Range
Lazard reviewed the range of historical trading prices of shares of the Company common stock during the 52-week period ended February 18,
2022. Lazard observed that, during this period, the daily closing price of the Company common stock ranged from $9.65 per share (on
February 11, 2022) to $22.27 per share (on June 15, 2021).
Broker Target Prices
Lazard observed price targets for the Company common stock as reflected in selected publicly available Wall Street equity research reports.
Lazard observed that the future price targets for the Company common stock ranged from $8.00 per share to $22.00 per share, which Lazard
discounted to present value based on an illustrative cost of equity of 20.7% to calculate a range of $6.65 per share to $18.25 per share
(rounded to the nearest $0.05).
General
In connection with Lazard’s services as a financial advisor to the Board, the Company agreed to pay Lazard an aggregate fee of $42 million,
$5 million of which was payable upon the rendering of Lazard’s opinion and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon consummation
of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of Lazard’s expenses arising, and to indemnify Lazard against
certain liabilities that may arise, out of Lazard’s engagement.
Lazard, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements,
leveraged buyouts, and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. In the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard’s opinion, Lazard
has provided certain investment banking services to the Company, for which Lazard received compensation of approximately $3 million,
including having been engaged to advise on corporate preparedness matters. In addition, Lazard in the past provided, currently is providing
and may in the future provide certain investment banking services to Apollo Global Management, Inc. and/or certain of its affiliates, for which
Lazard received and may receive compensation, including, during the past two years, having been engaged to advise on the acquisition of
Atlantic Leaf Properties, a potential acquisition and the acquisition of certain real estate assets from the Italian pension fund Fondazione Ente
Nazionale di Previdenza ed Assistenza dei Medici e degli Odontoiatri. The aggregate amount of fees paid to Lazard for financial advisory
services to Apollo Global Management, Inc. and its known affiliates in the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard’s opinion was between
$5 million and $10 million and does not include engagements where Lazard was retained by a special committee of an affiliate of Apollo
Global Management, Inc. to be independent of Apollo Global Management, Inc. In addition, in the ordinary course, Lazard and its affiliates
and employees may trade securities of the Company, Apollo Global Management, Inc. and certain of their respective affiliates for their own
accounts and for the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, and may
also trade and hold securities on behalf of the Company, Apollo Global Management, Inc. and certain of their respective affiliates. The
issuance of Lazard’s opinion was approved by the opinion committee of Lazard.

Certain Financial Projections",53,61
TENNECO INC_20220426_DEFM14A_20034100_4448087.Pdf,Certain Financial Projections,"Certain Financial Projections
In connection with Tenneco’s review of strategic alternatives and evaluation of a possible transaction with Apollo as discussed in greater detail
in “—Background of the Merger”, Tenneco management prepared certain non-public, unaudited, stand-alone five-year financial projection
scenarios for Tenneco on a standalone basis, including a so-called “Base Case” reflecting, among other things, management’s estimates for
global light vehicle production in 2022 through 2026 and other key assumptions described below. At its January 4, 2022 meeting, the Board
directed Lazard to use the Base Case for performing its financial analyses summarized under “—Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC”
beginning on page 45 of this proxy statement. In addition, the Board reviewed a so-called “Upside Case” based, in part, upon published IHS
Markit Ltd (“IHS Markit”) estimates for global light vehicle production in 2022 through 2026 and the other key assumptions described below.
Tenneco furnished the Upside Case to Apollo on December 9, 2021 in connection with Apollo’s preliminary review of Tenneco and the
proposed transaction. The Upside Case relied on industry-standard, publicly available global light vehicle production estimates for 2022
through 2026 prepared by IHS Markit and, accordingly, was viewed as an appropriate basis for presentation to Apollo.
Base Case Management Projections
The Base Case is summarized in the table below. Key assumptions reflected in the Base Case include:
•
Global light vehicle production volumes of 77.0 million units in 2022, 85.0 million units in 2023, 90.0 million units in 2024, 90.9 million
units in 2025 and 90.0 million units in 2026; and
•
3 percent annual growth in aftermarket revenues.
The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that Tenneco, its financial advisor or any of their respective
representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Base Case to be necessarily predictive of future
results.

(1) Value-added revenue is calculated by removing the effects on Tenneco’s revenues of doing business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and removing the effect of substrate sales in the
Clean Air segment that occur when, at the direction of its original equipment customers, Tenneco purchases catalytic converters or components thereof from suppliers, uses them in its
manufacturing processes and sells them as part of the completed system. While Tenneco original equipment customers assume the risk of this volatility, it impacts Tenneco’s revenue. Excluding
substrate sales removes this impact.
(2) EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating
income or net income as a measure of operating performance.
(3) Free cash flow is calculated as EBITDA less interest, income taxes, changes in net working capital, capital expenditures and other cash expenses. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and
should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows or a measure of liquidity.

(4) Unlevered Free Cash Flow was calculated by Lazard for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis as tax-adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for the impact of pensions and other post-
employment benefits, less capital expenditures, change in net working capital and certain other cash expenses based, in each case, on assumptions provided by Tenneco management.
Upside Case Management Projections
The Upside Case is summarized in the table below. Key assumptions reflected in the Upside Case include:
•
Global light vehicle production volumes of 82.7 million units in 2022, 91.9 million units in 2023, 98.1 million units in 2024, 99.5 million
units in 2025 and 99.0 million units in 2026; and
•
4 percent annual growth in aftermarket revenues.
The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that Tenneco, its financial advisor or any of their respective
representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Upside Case to be necessarily predictive of future
results.

The Base Case and Upside Case are referred to collectively as the “Financial Projections”. Tenneco’s ability to achieve the results set forth in
the Financial Projections is expressly dependent upon certain assumptions, including the historical trajectory of each of Tenneco’s
businesses, broad secular trends in the automotive sector and input from various managers of each of Tenneco’s businesses. The Financial
Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included herein only because such information was made available as
described above. The Financial Projections were not prepared with a view to complying with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (“GAAP”), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information.
Furthermore, the Financial Projections included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Tenneco’s
management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect
to the accompanying prospective Financial Projections and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any
other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this document relates to
Tenneco’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Financial Projections and should not be read to do so.
Although a summary of the Financial Projections is presented with numerical specificity, the Financial Projections reflect numerous variables,
assumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the
Financial Projections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to management at the time the Financial
Projections were prepared. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future
results. Important factors that may cause actual results to deviate from the Financial Projections include general economic conditions, results
or financial condition, industry performance, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows,
competitive pressures, accuracy of certain industry forecasts prepared by third parties, the cyclical and seasonal nature of the industries that
Tenneco serves; foreign operations, especially in emerging regions; changes in currency exchange rates; business disruptions due to public
health or safety emergencies, such as the novel strain of
54
Table of Contents
coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic; the cost and availability of supplies, raw materials and energy; the effectiveness of Tenneco’s research
and development, new product introductions and growth investments; acquisitions and divestitures of assets and gains and losses from
dispositions; developments affecting Tenneco’s outstanding liquidity and indebtedness, including debt covenants and interest rate exposure;
developments affecting Tenneco’s funded and unfunded pension obligations; warranty and product liability claims; legal proceedings; the
inability to establish or maintain certain business relationships and relationships with customers and suppliers or the inability to retain key
personnel; and the handling of hazardous materials and the costs of compliance with environmental regulations; extreme weather events and
natural disasters. In addition, the Financial Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that
they were prepared and do not give effect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Financial Projections will be realized,
and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Financial Projections. Since the Financial Projections cover
multiple years, that information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. The inclusion of this information should not
be regarded as an indication that the Board, Tenneco, our financial advisors, Parent, Parent’s representatives and affiliates (including Apollo)
or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Financial Projections to be material information of Tenneco or that
actual future results will necessarily reflect the Financial Projections, and the Financial Projections should not be relied upon as such. The
summary of the Financial Projections is not included herein to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal or any of the
other proposals to be voted on at the annual meeting or to influence any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the
Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to shares of Tenneco class A common stock.
The Financial Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements, risk factors and other
information regarding Tenneco contained in our public filings with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 160 of this
proxy statement.
The Financial Projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Tenneco’s future results to materially
vary, see “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” on page 25 of this proxy statement.
Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility, to update or
otherwise revise the Financial Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when Tenneco prepared the Financial Projections or
to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general economic or industry conditions, even if the assumptions underlying the
Financial Projections are shown to be in error. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the Financial Projections,
which were prepared as of an earlier date. By including in this proxy statement a summary of certain financial projections, neither Tenneco nor
any of its representatives or advisors, nor Parent, Parent’s representatives and affiliates (including Apollo), makes any representation to any
person regarding the ultimate performance of Tenneco compared to the information contained in such financial projections and should not be
read to do so.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Financial Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to unduly rely on
the Financial Projections included herein.
Certain of the measures included in the Financial Projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial
measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and
non-GAAP financial measures as used by Tenneco may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.

Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards
Under the Merger Agreement, the equity-based awards held by Tenneco’s directors and executive officers under the Tenneco Inc. 2006 Long-
Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on November 5, 2020 (the “2006 Plan”) and the Tenneco Inc. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan,
effective as of May 14, 2021 (the “2021 Plan” and, together with the 2006 Plan, the “Incentive Award Plans”) will be treated as follows:
Restricted Stock Units
Each Company RSU that is outstanding at the Effective Time will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, become fully vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject to any
applicable withholding taxes) equal to the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Tenneco class A common stock subject to
such Company RSU.
Performance Share Units
Each Company PSU that is outstanding at the Effective Time will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, become vested as to the number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock subject to such award that would vest at the target
level, and shall, after giving effect to such vesting, be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the Merger Consideration with respect to each vested share of Tenneco class A
common stock subject to such Company PSU.

Severance Benefits
We maintain the Tenneco Inc. Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives, as amended and restated effective November 5,
2020 (the “Executive Severance Plan”), which provides our executive officers (other than Mr. Patouhas) with severance benefits in the event of
a termination without “Cause” (and not as the result of the executive officer’s death or disability) or as the result of a “Constructive
Termination” in either case occurring on or within 24 months after a “Change in Control” (each as defined in the Executive Severance Plan),
which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes the Merger (each such termination, a “Qualifying Termination”), subject to a requirement that the
executive officer enter into a restrictive covenant agreement with Tenneco. For purposes of the Executive Severance Plan, Mr. Kesseler is a
Tier 1 participant and the rest of our executive officers are Tier 2 participants (other than Mr. Patouhas, who is not a participant in the
Executive Severance Plan).
We also maintain the Tenneco Automotive Operating Company Inc. Severance Benefit Plan, as amended and restated effective as of April 1,
2020 (the “Automotive Severance Plan”), which provides certain of our employees, including Mr. Patouhas, with severance benefits in the
event of a termination without “Cause” or as the result of a “Constructive Termination” (each as defined in the Automotive Severance Plan)
(each such termination, a “Covered Termination”), subject to a requirement that the employee enter into a general release of claims in favor of
Tenneco. Mr. Patouhas is a Group 1 participant in the Automotive Severance Plan, pursuant to which, in the event of a Covered Termination,
Mr. Patouhas would be entitled to severance benefits equal to the sum of (i) 52 weeks of continued base salary, (ii) his target bonus, and (iii)
52 weeks of the employer-paid portion of his monthly health insurance premiums, in each case determined as of his termination date.
Additionally, Mr. Patouhas would be entitled to outplacement benefits under Tenneco’s outplacement policy.
For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described below that would be payable to Messrs. Kesseler, Masanovich, Baird,
Jueckstock, and Norton upon a Qualifying Termination in connection with the Merger, see “—Named Officer Golden Parachute Compensation”

the Merger Agreement with respect to Company RSUs and Company PSUs to the executive officers who are not named executive officers if
the Merger were to be completed on April 13, 2022, is $21,387,980.
In the event that one of our executive officers were to experience a Qualifying Termination, the executive officer would be entitled to the

Deferred Compensation
All deferred compensation (and earnings accrued thereon) credits to the account of the
executive officer under any deferred compensation plan, program or arrangement of
Tenneco shall be paid pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of such plan, program
or arrangement.
Executive Incentive Compensation Plan
A cash amount equal to the sum of (i) any incentive compensation which has been
earned, but not yet paid, to the executive officer under the Executive Incentive
Compensation Plan for a prior calendar year, plus (ii) a pro-rata portion (as of the date of
the Qualifying Termination) of all of the executive officer’s incentive compensation awards
under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan for the current year or measuring period,
calculated at target.
Benefits
Continued health and welfare benefit plan
coverage for the executive officer and his/her
dependents for three years following the
Qualifying Termination.
Continued health and welfare benefit plan
coverage for the executive officer and his/her
dependents for two years following the

Outplacement
The executive officer shall receive reasonable outplacement services at a cost not to

In addition to the severance benefits described above, all equity awards granted to our executive officers and outstanding as of the Effective
Time will be accelerated in connection with the Merger, as further described above under “— Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards”
on page 56 of this proxy statement.
Continuing Employees
The Merger Agreement provides that from the Effective Time until 12 months following the effective time, each employee of Tenneco and any of
its subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Employee”) will receive (i) an annual base salary or wage
rate and a target annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less than the annual base salary or wage rate provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation
and defined benefit pension benefits) that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to the other compensation and benefits (excluding
equity and equity-based compensation and defined benefit pension benefits) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Merger Agreement further provides that the Surviving Corporation will honor, in accordance with their terms, all of
Tenneco’s benefit plans for a period of 12 months following the effective
58
Table of Contents
time (provided that the Surviving Corporation will continue to have the ability to amend Tenneco’s benefit plans in accordance with the terms of
the applicable benefit plan). With respect to benefit plans maintained by Parent and its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, for
purposes of determining a Continuing Employee’s eligibility to participate, level of vacation, paid time off and severance benefits, each
Continuing Employee’s service with Tenneco as reflected in Tenneco records will be treated as service with Parent or any of its subsidiaries to
the same extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited to such Continuing Employee under the analogous Tenneco benefit
plan as of the Effective Time (except to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits and excluding with respect
to any qualified or non-qualified defined benefit plans, non-qualified deferred compensation and post-termination or retiree health or welfare
benefits).
Named Officer Golden Parachute Compensation
The following table provides information about certain compensation for each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the Merger. The amounts in the table were calculated using outstanding Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by each named
executive officer as April 13, 2022 and a per-share price for Tenneco class A common stock of $20.00 (i.e., the Merger Consideration), and
assumes the Merger closed on April 13, 2022. The compensation summarized in the table and footnotes below is subject to a non-binding,
advisory vote of the stockholders of Tenneco, as described in “Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation” on
page 99 of this proxy statement.
The amounts in the following table are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may not actually occur, including assumptions
described in this proxy statement, and do not include amounts that were vested as of April 13, 2022. In addition, certain amounts will vary
depending on the actual date of closing of the Merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer
may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.

held by each named executive officer as of the Effective Time, as described above in “— Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards” on page 56 of this proxy statement, calculated by
multiplying (i) the total number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock subject to each Company RSU and Company PSU (with the number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock
subject to each Company PSU determined at target level) by (ii) $20.00 (i.e., the Merger Consideration). These amounts are single-trigger payments.

Pursuant to a debt commitment letter, dated as of February 22, 2022, which we refer to as the “Debt Commitment Letter”, a consortium of
financial institutions (in each case, acting directly or through their respective affiliates or branches, as appropriate, collectively, as the
“Committed Lenders”) has committed to provide, severally but not jointly, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, the debt commitment amount, which we refer to as the “debt commitment,” in the aggregate up to $6.0 billion in debt

The Debt Commitment Letter also contemplates that Parent will, at its option, (i) either (A) issue senior secured first lien notes (which we
refer to as the “Parent senior secured notes”) in a Rule 144A or other private placement on or prior to the closing date, yielding up to $2.0

Appraisal Rights",69,69
TENNECO INC_20220426_DEFM14A_20034100_4448087.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
General
If the Merger is completed, holders of shares of Tenneco class A common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and who properly demand an appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 of
the DGCL is required. Failure to timely and properly comply with such statutory requirements may result in the loss or waiver of your
appraisal rights.
This section summarizes certain material provisions of the DGCL pertaining to appraisal rights. The following discussion, however, is not a full
summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262 of
the DGCL, which is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein. All references within Section 262
of the DGCL to “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of Tenneco class A common stock. The following discussion does not
constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a Tenneco stockholder should exercise its
right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under the DGCL, if you hold one or more shares of Tenneco class A common stock, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, are the record holder of such shares and continuously hold such shares through the Effective Time and otherwise comply with the
requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and
to receive the “fair value” of such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger or related transactions) in cash, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. It is possible that any such “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less
than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration which Tenneco stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive upon the consummation of
the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as appraisal rights.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting at which the adoption of the Merger Agreement will be submitted
to the stockholders, Tenneco must notify each stockholder who was a Tenneco
Tenneco Inc.

stockholder on April 20, 2022 (the “Record Date”) and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and
include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. THIS PROXY STATEMENT CONSTITUTES THE REQUIRED FORMAL NOTICE,
AND A COPY OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL IS ATTACHED AS APPENDIX C TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT.
A HOLDER OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO
PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO SHOULD REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS AND APPENDIX C CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO
COMPLY PRECISELY WITH THE PROCEDURES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL IN A TIMELY AND PROPER MANNER MAY RESULT IN
THE LOSS OR WAIVER OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE
RIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, A HOLDER OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK WHO IS
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO EXERCISE ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS, IS ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN LEGAL COUNSEL.
ANY SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK HELD BY A TENNECO STOCKHOLDER WHO FAILS TO PERFECT,
SUCCESSFULLY WITHDRAWS OR OTHERWISE LOSES HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN
CONVERTED AS OF THE EFFECTIVE TIME INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION, WITHOUT INTEREST.
How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights
If you are a Tenneco stockholder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of Tenneco class A common stock, you
must comply with ALL of the following:
•
you must NOT vote “FOR,” or otherwise consent in writing to, the Merger Proposal. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but
does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, if you submit a proxy and
wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must include voting instructions to vote your share “AGAINST,” or as an abstention with
respect to, the Merger Proposal;
•
you must continuously hold your shares of Tenneco class A common stock from the date of making the demand through the Effective
Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer your shares of Tenneco class A common stock before the Effective Time;
•
prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, you must deliver a proper written demand for appraisal of
your shares; and
•
you (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Tenneco class A common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of
the fair value of your shares of Tenneco class A common stock within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under
no obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation
of Tenneco stockholders who seek to exercise their appraisal rights to initiate all necessary action to properly demand their appraisal
rights in respect of shares of Tenneco class A common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Filing a Written Demand
Neither voting against the Merger Proposal nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a
written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. Any record holder of shares of Tenneco class A
common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Tenneco, before the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the
special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares. A stockholder’s failure to deliver the written demand prior to
the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting will result in a loss or waiver of appraisal rights. The written demand for
appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal.
A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. Only a holder of record may demand appraisal rights
for the shares of Tenneco class A common stock registered in that holder’s name. Such
62
Table of Contents
demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Tenneco of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand
appraisal of the “fair value” of his, her or its shares of Tenneco class A common stock. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the
stockholder’s name as it appears on the share certificate or certificates that represent such stockholder’s shares or in the book entry that
represents such stockholder’s shares, as the case may be. Beneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of Tenneco class A common
stock of record may not directly make appraisal demands to Tenneco. The beneficial owner must, in such case, arrange for the holder of
record, such as a bank, broker or nominee, to timely submit the required demand in respect of those shares of Tenneco class A common
stock. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or nominee, who holds shares of Tenneco class A common stock as a nominee or
intermediary for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Tenneco class A common stock held for one or more
beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. The written demand should state the number of shares of Tenneco
class A common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock is expressly
mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Tenneco class A common stock held in the name of the holder of record. The
failure of a holder of record to properly and validly exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 on behalf of a beneficial holder may result in the
loss or waiver of appraisal rights.
IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE
FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKER OR NOMINEE TO
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR
APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK
HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A NOMINEE OR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO
CAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO DEMAND
YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK OR
BROKERAGE WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE
DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE
DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD.
If your shares of Tenneco class A common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian,
execution of the demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if your shares are owned of record jointly with one or more other
persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however,
the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting
as agent for the holder or holders of record. Stockholders who hold their shares of Tenneco class A common stock in brokerage accounts or
other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers or other nominees to determine the
appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.
If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:

At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Tenneco stockholder that made a demand for appraisal but has not commenced an

Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares of Tenneco class A common stock by delivering to the

Notice by the Surviving Corporation. Within 10 days after the Effective Time, Tenneco, as the Surviving Corporation, must notify each holder of
Tenneco class A common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and has not voted in favor
of the Merger Proposal of the date that the Merger has become effective.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not later, either you, provided
you have complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the Surviving
Corporation may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the
Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by you, demanding an appraisal of the fair value of the shares of Tenneco class A common
stock held by all stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. None of Parent, Merger Sub or Tenneco, as the Surviving Corporation,
is under any obligation to file an appraisal petition or has any intention to do so. If you desire to have your shares of Tenneco class A common
stock appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for properly demanding your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the
manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. The failure of a holder of Tenneco class A common stock to file such a petition within the time
periods specified in Section 262 may nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to
receive from the Surviving Corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Tenneco class A
common stock not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which Tenneco has received demands for appraisal, and the
aggregate number of holders of those shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of (i) 10 days after
receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the request therefor or (ii) 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If
you are the beneficial owner of shares of Tenneco class A common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on your behalf you may, in
your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or if you deliver to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of your demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving
Corporation, then your right to appraisal will cease.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record of Tenneco class A common stock who has properly exercised his, her
or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware
Court of Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have demanded payment for their shares of
Tenneco class A common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of Tenneco class A common stock have not been
reached by the Surviving Corporation. After notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to
the Surviving Corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated as required by the court, the Delaware
Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine which Tenneco stockholders have complied with Section
262 of the DGCL and have become entitled to appraisal rights and may require the Tenneco stockholders demanding appraisal who hold
certificated shares of Tenneco class A common stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any Tenneco stockholder
who fails to comply with this direction. Such notice shall also be given by one or more publications at least one week before the day of the
hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the
costs thereof shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation. In addition, because immediately before the Merger the shares will be listed on a
national securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, unless (i) the total number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of Tenneco class A common
64
Table of Contents
stock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock exceeds
$1.0 million.
The appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of Tenneco class A common stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance
with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of Tenneco class A common stock held by all Tenneco
stockholders who have properly demanded their appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over
the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and
the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the
appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination
of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the Surviving Corporation and who has
submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until
it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the
Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as
provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the value is determined, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the Tenneco stockholders entitled to receive the
same, forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders to the Surviving Corporation of their
stock certificates. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment to each stockholder prior to such
entry of judgement.
After determining the holders of class A common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the “fair value” of
the shares of class A common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that
could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are
generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making
this determination of fair value, the court may consider market value, asset value, the price negotiated by the parties, the unaffected stock
price, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger
that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated
that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the
speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated
that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and
not the product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy,
depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder’s exclusive remedy.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares, as so determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek
appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration
payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Tenneco believes
that the Merger
Tenneco Inc.
65
2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting
Table of Contents
Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the
same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Tenneco nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder
exercising appraisal rights, and each of Tenneco and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of
Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of class A common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely
filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and
expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and
the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised. Absent such an order, each
party is responsible for his, her or its own expenses.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party, you may withdraw a demand for appraisal
and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the consideration
payable in the Merger to the Surviving Corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will
require written approval of the Surviving Corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to
any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court
of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any Tenneco stockholder that has made an appraisal
demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to properly demand or
successfully withdraw your demand for appraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of Tenneco class A common stock will
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less
any applicable withholding taxes.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for properly demanding appraisal rights may result in the loss or waiver of your
appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your shares of Tenneco class A common stock in
accordance with the Merger Agreement.
THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE TECHNICAL
PREREQUISITES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. FAILURE TO STRICTLY FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN SECTION 262
OF THE DGCL MAY RESULT IN A WAIVER OR LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU WISH TO

The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S.
holders (each as defined below) of Tenneco class A common stock who receive cash in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common
stock pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is for general informational purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all
potential tax consequences of the Merger. The tax consequences of the Merger under U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to
income tax, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is
based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial
66Table of Contents
decisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as
of the date of this proxy statement. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations, and any such change or differing
interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this
discussion. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to
seek, any rulings from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following discussion. There can be
no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the Merger.
This discussion is limited to holders of shares of Tenneco class A common stock who hold such shares as “capital assets” within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax
consequences that may be relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net
investment income and the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences
to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:
•
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
persons holding shares of Tenneco class A common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a
conversion transaction or other integrated investment;
•
banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions;
•
brokers, dealers or traders in securities;
•
“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax;
•
partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S corporations” or other
pass-through entities (and investors therein);
•
real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies;
•
tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;
•
persons deemed to sell their shares of Tenneco class A common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;
•
persons who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or, following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation;
•
persons who hold or received their shares of Tenneco class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or
otherwise as compensation; and
•
tax-qualified retirement plans.
This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares of Tenneco class A common stock
who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under the DGCL.
If an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of Tenneco class A common stock,
the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain
determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding shares of Tenneco class A common stock and partners in such
partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
Definition of a U.S. Holder
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of Tenneco class A common stock that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
•
a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more “United States persons” (within the
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (ii) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
Effect of the Merger
The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of any taxable gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder who receives cash for
shares of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger will generally equal the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received for
such shares (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a share will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for such share. The amount and
character of such gain or loss and the holding period of shares will be determined separately for each block of shares of Tenneco class A
common stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged for cash in the Merger. Any gain or loss realized
by a U.S. holder upon the receipt of cash in exchange for a share of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger will generally be capital
gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such share for more than one year at the effective time of
Merger. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss which is subject to U.S. federal income tax at the same rates as
ordinary income. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally taxable at a
reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to
information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). Such payments will not be subject to backup withholding
if the U.S. holder (i) completes and returns to the paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal
certifying that the U.S. holder is a United States person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that the U.S. holder is not
subject to backup withholding or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption. Certain holders (including corporations) are not subject to backup
withholding or information reporting.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit
against the U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for
obtaining such an exemption.
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Tenneco class A common stock that is neither a U.S.
holder nor an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Effect of the Merger
A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares
of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base,
maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States);
•
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the
disposition of shares of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger and certain other requirements are met; or
•
at the time of the Merger, Tenneco is a U.S. real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes or has
been a USRPHC at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger or the non-U.S. holder’s holding
period for its shares of Tenneco class A common stock, and the non-U.S. holder owned (actually or constructively) more than five percent
of the total fair market value of the outstanding shares of Tenneco class A common stock at any time during such applicable period.
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular U.S.
federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may
be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on such
effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items.
A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such
lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of
Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the
individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with
respect to such losses.
With respect to the third bullet point above, although there can be no assurances in this regard and Tenneco has not made a definitive
determination, Tenneco believes that it is not currently a USRPHC and has not been a USRPHC during the five-year period ending on the date
of the Merger. Even if Tenneco is or was a USRPHC during the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger, gain realized by a non-U.S.
holder on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax if Tenneco class A common stock continues to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange at the time of the Merger and such
non-U.S. holder owned (actually or constructively) five percent or less of the total fair market value of the outstanding shares of Tenneco class
A common stock during the applicable period.
Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made to non-U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to
information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). A non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to
information reporting and backup withholding if the non-U.S. holder (i) provides the paying agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN,
W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (or successor form), as the case may be, certifying under penalties of perjury the holder’s non-U.S. status (and the
paying agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person) or (ii) otherwise establishes an
exemption.
Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty or information
exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit
against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
The discussion above of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not intended to constitute a complete description of
all tax consequences relating to the Merger. This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax or legal
advice. Because individual circumstances may differ, each holder should consult their tax advisor regarding the applicability of
the rules discussed above to the holder and the particular tax effects to the holder of the Merger in light of such holder’s
particular circumstances, including the tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or through the
application of any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or any applicable income tax treaty.

General
Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are
necessary, proper or advisable under the Merger Agreement and applicable law to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable. These approvals
include the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the “HSR Act”) and clearance of the Merger having been granted by relevant antitrust and foreign direct investment authorities in
certain other jurisdictions.
In addition, each of Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to (1) cooperate reasonably with each other
in connection with regulatory filings or submissions in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any
investigation or other inquiry by a governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (2)
promptly inform the other parties of material communications received from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or any other similar governmental entity (foreign or domestic); (3) consult with each other prior to taking any material
position with respect to the regulatory filings or submissions; (4) permit the other parties’ legal counsel to review and discuss in advance any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any governmental entity with respect to
regulatory approvals; and (5) coordinate with the other parties’ legal counsel in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly
provide the other parties’ legal counsel with copies of all filings, presentations or material submissions made by such party with any
governmental entity with respect to regulatory approvals. Parent will, with prior notice to and consultation of Tenneco, and taking Tenneco’s
views into account in good faith, control and lead all communications and strategy on behalf of the parties relating to regulatory approvals.
If and to the extent necessary to obtain any regulatory approval required for the closing of the Merger or to avoid the entry of or have lifted or
terminated any order restraining or enjoining the Merger, Parent will (1) propose, negotiate
70Table of Contents
and offer to commit and to effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale or other disposition of any assets or
businesses of Tenneco or its subsidiaries; (B) behavioral limitations on the assets or businesses of Tenneco or its subsidiaries; and (C) the
termination, modification, transfer or other action with respect to any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of Tenneco
or its subsidiaries; (2) otherwise offer to take action that it is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, take such action, that limits or
affects its freedom of action; and (3) in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered that would make consummation of the Merger unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the Merger,
any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent is not required to
take any of the foregoing actions to the extent such actions would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of Tenneco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to the Merger.
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Merger cannot be completed
until Tenneco and Parent each file a notification and report form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the
“DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period thereunder has expired or been terminated. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub
submitted a notification to the FTC on March 8, 2022, and the applicable waiting period expired on April 7, 2022. Accordingly, the transaction
has been cleared by the FTC.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including
seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or
hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and
notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or
seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under
certain circumstances.
Foreign Competition Laws
European Union. Both Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, conduct business across the European Union in multiple member
states. Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of January 2004, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
which we refer to as the “EU Merger Regulation”, mergers and acquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and individual European
Union sales exceeding specified thresholds must be notified to, reviewed and approved by the European Commission before they are
implemented. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, meet the thresholds set out in the EU Merger Regulation and are therefore
obligated to (i) notify the transaction to the European Commission of and (ii) wait to implement the merger until after the European
Commission has issued a decision declaring the merger compatible with the common market. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub submitted a
draft filing to the European Commission on March 28, 2022 and intend to file a formal notification to the European Commission as soon as is
reasonably practicable.
Canada. In addition, under the Competition Act of Canada, transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue thresholds cannot
be consummated until they are filed, reviewed and approved by the Competition Bureau of Canada. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their
affiliates, have sufficient revenues to exceed the relevant statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the merger is therefore conditioned
upon the Competition Bureau’s approval. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub filed a notification to the Competition Bureau on March 17, 2022.
On March 21, 2022 the Competition Bureau issued an Advance Ruling Certificate (“ARC”) pursuant to section 102 of the Competition Act by
which it granted the relevant regulatory approval.
China. Under the Antimonopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue
thresholds cannot be consummated until they are notified to, reviewed and approved by the State
Tenneco Inc.

2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting
Table of Contents
Administration for Market Regulation, which we refer to as “SAMR.” Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, have sufficient
revenues to exceed SAMR’s statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the merger is therefore conditioned upon SAMR’s approval.
Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub filed a notification to SAMR on April 8, 2022.
Japan. Under the Anti-Monopoly Act of Japan, transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue thresholds cannot be
consummated until they are notified to, reviewed and approved by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, which we refer to as “JFTC”.
Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub have sufficient revenues to exceed the relevant statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the merger
is therefore conditioned upon JFTC’s approval. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub filed a draft notification to JFTC on April 22, 2022.
Mexico. Under the Federal Economic Competition Law of Mexico, transactions involving parties having sales and assets in Mexico exceeding
specified thresholds must be notified to, reviewed and approved by the Federal Economic Competition Commission, which we refer to as
“COFECE”. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, have sufficient revenues and assets to exceed COFECE’s statutory
thresholds for review, and completion of the merger is therefore conditioned upon COFECE’s approval. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub filed a
notification to COFECE on April 8, 2022.
Other Regulatory Approvals. Completion of the transaction is further subject to the receipt of additional clearances and/or approvals under the
antitrust laws of certain other jurisdictions. This includes, among other jurisdictions, potential clearances and/or approvals under the antitrust
laws of Russia and Ukraine. Apollo may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive the receipt of such Russian and/or Ukrainian approvals and/or
clearances as conditions to the consummation of the Merger.
Foreign Direct Investment Laws
Completion of the merger is further subject to receipt of foreign direct investment approvals in Spain and Australia. Tenneco, Parent and
Merger Sub filed the respective notifications to the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism of Spain and the Foreign Investment Review Board
(“FIRB”) of Australia on March 31, 2022.
Other Regulatory Approvals
One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary
approvals and consents to the Merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn
regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no
way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and
there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by Tenneco stockholders and the completion of the Merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory
clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not
involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.

Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-01052 (E.D. Pa.) (the “Whitfield Complaint”). On March 22, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Greenfield v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01571
(E.D.N.Y) (the “Greenfield Complaint”). On March 29, 2022 a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Kirsch v. Tenneco, et al., No. 1:22-cv-00399 (D. Del.) (the “Kirsch Complaint,” and together with
the O’Dell Complaint, Truhlicka Complaint, Waterman Complaint, Whitfield Complaint, and Greenfield Complaint, the “Federal Complaints”).
The Federal Complaints name Tenneco and members of its board of directors as defendants and allege that defendants made materially
incomplete and misleading statements about the proposed acquisition of Tenneco by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. Specifically,
the plaintiffs assert claims under Sections 14 and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9, challenging the adequacy of disclosures
regarding the Company’s projections, Lazard’s financial analyses, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction in the
preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 14, 2022 (the “Preliminary Proxy”). The Federal Complaints seek, among other
relief, (i) injunctive relief preventing the parties from proceeding with the merger until the alleged disclosure deficiencies have been remedied,
(ii) rescission in the event the merger is consummated, (iii) damages, and (iv) an award of costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees and
expenses.
On March 30, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial District of the State of Illinois,
Lake County, captioned Drulias v. Armes, et al., No. 22CH00000102 (lll. Cir. Ct. Lake Co.) (the “Drulias Complaint”). The Drulias Complaint
names Tenneco, members of its board of directors, and Apollo Global Management, Inc. as defendants. The plaintiff asserts claims for
violation of the Illinois Securities Act of 1953 and Illinois statutory and common law, alleges that the acquisition price and process was unfair
to shareholders, and challenges the adequacy of disclosures in the Preliminary Proxy regarding the Company’s projections, Lazard’s financial
analyses and fairness opinion, management conflicts of interest, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction. The Drulias
Complaint seeks, among other relief, (i) declaratory relief stating that defendants violated the Illinois Securities Act of 1953 and Illinois
statutory and common law, (ii) injunctive relief preventing defendants from holding a shareholder vote and proceeding with the merger until the
alleged disclosure deficiencies have been remedied, (iii) damages, and (iv) an award of costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees and
expenses.
Stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the merger, which may name the Company, Merger Sub, Parent, or members of the
Board of Directors for the Company or Parent and/or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or
the complaint, including the amount of costs associated with defending, or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the
litigation of, such claims. Tenneco believes that the Complaints are without merit.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the Merger Proposal.
The following summary describes certain material provisions of the Merger Agreement. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A and incorporated into this proxy
statement by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain
all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express
terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement and the Summary of the Merger Agreement
The Merger Agreement and the summary of terms included in this proxy statement have been prepared to provide you with information
regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement. Factual disclosures about Tenneco contained in this proxy statement or in Tenneco’s public
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as described in “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 160
of this proxy statement, may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about Tenneco contained in the Merger Agreement and in
this summary. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the purposes of
the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates and solely for the benefit of parties to the Merger Agreement, and:
•
were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the
right not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue, due to a change in
circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as
facts;
•
have been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made among the parties to the Merger Agreement in
connection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement itself;
•
may no longer be true as of a given date;
•
may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality in a way that is different from those generally applicable to you or other
stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC; and
•
may be subject, in some cases, to other exceptions and qualifications, including exceptions that do not result in, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, as defined in “—Representations and Warranties” on page 78 of
this proxy statement.
Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Tenneco, Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective affiliates or businesses. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations
on the respective businesses of Tenneco, Parent or Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly
permitted in the confidential disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which
consent may be given without notice to the public. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties,
which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement, and
subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may not be included in this proxy statement.
Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other provisions of the Merger Agreement or any description of such provisions
should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the
documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, as well as the disclosures in Tenneco’s periodic and current reports, proxy
statements and other documents filed with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 160 of this proxy statement.

shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the paying agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the paying agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time. In
the event such deposited funds are insufficient to make the payments for the purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration,
Parent will promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the paying agent additional funds to ensure that the paying agent has sufficient
funds to make such payments.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than the third business day following the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation will cause the paying agent to mail to each person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
represented by a stock certificate, or a holder of book-entry Shares, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal, together with instructions for effecting the surrender of the stock certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the certificates) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a stock certificate (or
affidavit of loss) to the paying agent, together with delivery of an executed letter of transmittal, with respect to such stock certificate, the
paying agent will transmit to the holder of such stock certificates the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
stock certificates (subject to any applicable tax withholding), and any such stock certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled.
Each holder of record of one or more book-entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
76
Table of Contents
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the paying agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such book-entry Share, a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the
Merger Consideration (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes), and such book-entry Shares will be cancelled.
At the Effective Time the stock transfer books of Tenneco will be closed and thereafter there will be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of Tenneco. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of stock certificates and book-entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for in the
Merger Agreement or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, stock certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in the Merger Agreement.
If any cash deposited with the paying agent remains unclaimed by the holders of stock certificates or book-entry Shares on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, such cash will be returned to the Surviving Corporation and any holder of Shares who has not tendered its
stock certificates or book-entry Shares for the Merger Consideration prior to such time shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for the delivery of the Merger Consideration (without any interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws). Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of stock certificates or book-entry Shares
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any governmental entity will, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the paying agent will not be liable to any holder of a stock
certificate or book-entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the paying agent to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected will be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand.
In the event that any stock certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the paying agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed stock certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such stock certificate is lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Merger Consideration. Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the paying
agent with respect to the stock certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Completion of the Transaction; Closing
The closing of the Merger will take place at 8:00 a.m. local time, on the third business day following satisfaction of all of the conditions to
closing (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions at
the closing) or on such other date as is agreed to by Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub. However, if the Marketing Period (as defined below)
has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to closing, then the closing will occur on the date following the
satisfaction of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of (i) any business day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent
on no less than three business days’ prior notice to Tenneco and (ii) three business days following the final day of the Marketing Period
(subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver, if applicable of the closing conditions at the Effective Time). On the closing date, or on
such other date as may be agreed to, Merger Sub or Tenneco will cause a certificate of merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and will make all other filings required under the DGCL.
The Merger will become effective at the time the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later
date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger (such date and time at which the Merger becomes
effective is referred to as the “Effective Time”).

Table of Contents
The “Marketing Period” refers generally (subject to certain exceptions described in the Merger Agreement) to an initial period of 17
consecutive calendar days beginning on the first day after the date on which Tenneco has delivered to Parent certain financial information,
which is referred to herein as the “Required Financial Information”; provided, that in order for the Marketing Period to run, (i) such financial
information provided by Tenneco must meet certain requirements throughout such 17-consecutive-day period; (ii) the conditions to the closing
of the Merger must remain satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the closing) throughout such 17-consecutive-day period; and (iii) nothing shall have occurred and no
condition shall exist that would cause any of such conditions to closing to fail to be satisfied if the closing were scheduled to occur at any
time during such 17-consecutive-day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Marketing Period will end on any earlier date prior to the
expiration of the 17-consecutive-day period if the debt financing to be obtained by Parent in connection with the Merger is closed on such
earlier date (including closing into escrow).
The Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the completion of such
17-consecutive-day period, certain actions are taken by Tenneco or its independent accountants with respect to its historical financial
statements or other financial information included in the Required Financial Information provided to Parent, the Required Financial Information
ceases to comply with all requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement at any time during such 17-consecutive-day period, or Tenneco
shall have failed to file any report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Dissenting Shares
Any Shares held by stockholders who are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who
comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting
Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares will cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into, and
shall be exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding of
taxes.

knowledge, any Tenneco joint venture is party, except, with respect to clauses (iii), (iv) and (v), for any such conflicts, violations,

Material Adverse Effect (as defined below);

•
the opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC.
Many of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement are qualified by the knowledge of certain specified officers and members
of senior management or a “materiality” or “material adverse effect” standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless
their failure to be true or correct, individually or in the aggregate, would, as the case may be, be material or have a Company Material Adverse
Effect).
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Company Material Adverse Effect” means any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or
development that, individually or in the aggregate, (a) would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay, interfere with,
impair or hinder the consummation by Tenneco of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the compliance
by Tenneco with its obligations under the Merger Agreement or (b) has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business, results of operations, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Tenneco or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except that
the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect excludes from clause (b) any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or
development attributable to:
(i) the announcement of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (provided that this clause (i) does not apply to any
representation or warranty to the extent the purpose of such representation or warranty is

to address, as applicable, the consequences resulting from the execution and delivery the Merger Agreement, the pendency or
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement);
(ii) conditions generally affecting the industries in which Tenneco and its subsidiaries participate, the economy as a whole or the capital
markets in general or the markets in which Tenneco and its subsidiaries operate;
(iii) the taking of any action to the extent expressly required by the Merger Agreement (but excluding Tenneco’s obligation to operate in
the ordinary course of business);
(iv) any change after February 22, 2022 in applicable laws or the interpretation thereof by governmental entities;
(v) any change after February 22, 2022 in GAAP;
(vi) the commencement, continuation or escalation of a war, material armed hostilities or other material international or national calamity
or act of terrorism;
(vii) volcanoes, tsunamis, pandemics or disease outbreaks (including COVID-19 or any measures related to COVID-19), earthquakes,
hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters;
(viii) any failure to meet any internal or public projections, forecasts, guidance, estimates, milestones, budgets or internal or published
financial or operating predictions of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (provided that the underlying cause of such change,
decline or failure may be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect as occurred); and
(ix) changes after the date hereof in the trading price or trading volume of Shares or any suspension of trading, or any changes in the
ratings or the ratings outlook for Tenneco by any applicable rating agency or changes in any analyst’s recommendations or ratings with
respect to Tenneco (provided that the underlying cause of such failure may be taken into account in determining whether a material
adverse effect has occurred).
Any change referred to in the foregoing clauses (ii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) may be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or
would reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect to the extent such change has a disproportionate adverse effect on
Tenneco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other participants in the industry or jurisdiction in which Tenneco and its
subsidiaries operate (in which case only such incremental disproportionate adverse effect may be taken into account in determining whether
there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect).
None of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement will survive the completion of the Merger.
Conduct of Business Prior to Closing
Certain covenants in the Merger Agreement restrict the conduct of Tenneco’s and its subsidiaries’ business between the date of the Merger
Agreement and the Effective Time. Except (i) as expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) as required by applicable law; (iii) with
the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); or (iv) as set forth on the confidential disclosures
schedules to the Merger Agreement, (x) Tenneco shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to (A) conduct its
operations in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (including with respect to its joint ventures) and (B) preserve the

No Solicitation by Tenneco
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, until the earlier of the closing date of the Merger and the termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Tenneco has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries not to, instruct, authorize or knowingly
permit any of their officers and directors or any of their other representatives to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist,
any inquiry or proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);
•
furnish to any third party any non-public information relating to Tenneco or its subsidiaries, or afford to any third party access to the
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Tenneco or its subsidiaries, in any such
case with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal;
•
participate or engage in discussions, communications or negotiations with any third party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or

or
•
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
other contract with respect to, or that is intended to result in, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction
(as defined below).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval (as defined below), (i) Tenneco has received a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal from a third party, (ii) the Acquisition Proposal was not the result of any material breach of the non-solicitation
restrictions in the Merger Agreement and (iii) the Board of Directors of Tenneco (the “Board”) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or
would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, Tenneco may, directly or indirectly, (x) contact the third party who submitted such
Acquisition Proposal to clarify any ambiguous terms and conditions to determine whether the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish non-public
information relating to Tenneco and its subsidiaries, or afford access to non-public information, or to any personnel, of Tenneco or its
subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that is not materially less favorable to Tenneco than its confidentiality agreement with
Apollo Management IX, L.P., to any third party or its representatives that has made or delivered to Tenneco such Acquisition Proposal.
Tenneco must provide to Parent and its representatives any non-public information that is provided to any third party or its representatives if
such information was not previously made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently to the time it is provided to such third party.
Subject to certain limited exceptions, neither our Board nor any committee thereof will take the following actions (each, a “Board
Recommendation Change”):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub in any material respect, its
recommendation to approve the Merger;
•
adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal;
•
fail to include the Board’s recommendation to approve the Merger in this proxy statement;
•
within five business days of Parent’s written request, fail to make or reaffirm its recommendation to approve the Merger following the
date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first publicly disclosed or distributed to Tenneco’s stockholders;
•
cause Tenneco or its subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement; or
•
publicly propose or agree to any of the foregoing.
If Tenneco receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board may, provided that Tenneco has not breached the non-
solicitation restrictions in the Merger Agreement in any material respect with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, effect a Board
Recommendation Change (as defined below) with respect to such Superior Proposal or terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to the
terms thereof to enter into a definitive agreement contemplating the consummation of such Superior Proposal (an “Alternative Acquisition
Agreement”). Tenneco, however, is not entitled to effect a Board Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger Agreement unless Tenneco
has provided to Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice of Tenneco’s intention to take such action, which notice will specify
the identity of the third party making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions thereof and include copies of all relevant
documents related to such Acquisition Proposal, and unless:
•
during the three-business-day notice period described above, if requested by Parent, Tenneco will have engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent and Merger Sub regarding any adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement or related
documentation proposed by Parent and Merger Sub to cause the relevant Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal; and

•
the Board will have taken into account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement or related documentation
proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub no later than 11:59 p.m. (Central Time) on the last day of such three-business-day
notice period and will have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.
In the event of any material, written revisions to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal, Tenneco is required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent describing such revisions and to again comply with the negotiation obligations described above for an additional two business days
following such new notice.
The Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, effect a Board Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event (as defined below). Tenneco, however, will not be entitled to effect a Board Recommendation Change pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, unless:
•
the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
•
Tenneco provides three business days’ prior written notice to Parent of its intention to effect a Board Recommendation Change, which
notice must specify the basis for the Board Recommendation Change and describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail;
•
during the three-business-day notice period, Tenneco and its representatives negotiate with Parent, Merger Sub and their
representatives in good faith to allow Parent and Merger Sub to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and related transactional agreements to obviate the need for a Board Recommendation Change; and
•
following the notice period, the Board (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) determines that the failure
of the Board to make such a Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable law.
In the event of any material modifications to the Intervening Event occur, Tenneco is required to deliver a new written notice to Parent
describing such modifications and to again comply with the negotiation obligations described above for an additional three business days
following such new notice.
Nothing in the Merger Agreement limits Tenneco’s or the Board’s ability to (i) take and disclose to Tenneco’s stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
including a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Board to the Tenneco stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication); (ii) comply with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act; (iii) inform any person of the existence of the non-solicitation obligations contained in the Merger Agreement; or (iv) make any disclosure
to Tenneco stockholders required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement, it being understood that (1) any
such statement or disclosure made by the Board must be subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and not limit or
otherwise affect the obligations of Tenneco or the rights of Parent under the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, and (2)
Tenneco will not be permitted to effect a Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement.
As used in this proxy statement:
•
“Acquisition Proposal” means, any bona ride written offer, proposal, indication of interest or inquiry by a third party, other than a
proposal made by Parent or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, contemplating or
otherwise relating to any transaction or series of transactions involving any (i) acquisition, purchase or license of assets of Tenneco
and its subsidiaries constituting 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Tenneco and its subsidiaries (excluding cash), or to which

beyond the date that the consummation of the Merger is required to be effected in accordance with the Merger Agreement;
•

condition or otherwise expand any condition that makes the funding of the debt financing in an amount required to satisfy the Financing
Purposes less likely to occur or be on terms and conditions that are materially less favorable to Parent from a conditionality or enforceability
perspective than the terms and conditions of the existing Debt Commitment Letter; provided, that Parent will not be required to pay any fees

review all offering documents and marketing materials for the debt financing and identify any information that it reasonably believes constitutes
material non-public information, and if Tenneco identifies any such information, then Tenneco will file a current report on Form 8-K containing

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent is required to indemnify and hold harmless Tenneco and its subsidiaries, and each of their
respective representatives, from and against any and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred in connection with the debt financing or any
assistance or activities provided in connection with the arrangement of the debt financing and any information utilized in connection therewith;

subsidiaries in connection with their cooperation in connection with the debt financing. Obtaining the financing is not a condition to closing of
the Merger.
Tenneco Indebtedness
Under the Merger Agreement, Parent will be permitted to commence and conduct one or more offers to purchase, exchange offers or consent
solicitations (such offer or consent solicitation, a “Debt Offer” and collectively, the “Debt Offers”) with respect to Tenneco’s existing notes in
compliance with the terms of the applicable indenture governing Tenneco’s existing notes and applicable law. Tenneco and its subsidiaries will
use reasonable best efforts to, and will use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their representatives and the trustee under the
applicable indenture governing Tenneco’s existing notes to, reasonably cooperate with Parent to permit any such Debt Offer to be effected on
such terms, conditions and timing as is reasonably requested by Parent. Parent will prepare any documentation related thereto and Tenneco
will reasonably assist and cooperate with Parent to prepare such documentation. The closing (or, if applicable, operation) of any Debt Offer
will be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the consummation of the Merger or the acceptance for purchase of Tenneco’s existing
notes, as applicable, by Parent, and the parties will use reasonable best efforts to cause such Debt Offer to close (or become operative) on
the closing date of the Merger. If a consent solicitation with respect to Tenneco’s existing notes is conducted and the requisite consent is
obtained, if reasonably requested by Parent, Tenneco and its subsidiaries will execute one or more supplemental indentures to the applicable
indenture governing Tenneco’s existing notes to amend the terms and provisions of the applicable indenture governing Tenneco’s existing
notes as described in such consent solicitation, and Tenneco and its subsidiaries will use reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under
the applicable indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture. Such supplemental indenture will become effective upon execution thereof
and operative no earlier than the closing date of the Merger or the acceptance for purchase of Tenneco’s existing notes, as applicable, by
Parent.
In lieu of or in addition to any Debt Offer, if requested by Parent, Tenneco will send any notices of redemption with respect to all or a portion of

existing notes, take such actions as may be required under the applicable indenture governing Tenneco’s existing notes to cause the
applicable trustee to proceed with the redemption of Tenneco’s existing notes, as applicable, and to send such notices of redemption to the
holders of Tenneco’s existing notes, as applicable, and prepare and deliver all other documents required under each applicable indenture
governing Tenneco’s existing notes to issue such notices of redemption. If such notices of redemption are sent prior to the closing date of the
Merger, then such redemption will be conditioned on the closing of the Merger. On or prior to the closing date of the Merger, Parent will make,
or cause to be made, a deposit with the applicable trustee of funds sufficient to pay in full Tenneco’s existing notes that are subject to such
notices of redemption.
Under the Merger Agreement, Tenneco will have delivered to Parent at least two business days prior to the closing date of the transactions, a

obligations thereunder and providing for a release of all liens and guarantees thereunder, and all documentation relating to the release of all
liens with respect to Tenneco’s existing credit facility and Tenneco’s existing secured notes. Parent will be responsible for paying the payoff
amount set forth in the Payoff Letter.

Consents, Approvals and Filings
Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Merger to be satisfied and to complete the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to make appropriate filings under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the “HSR Act”) and certain foreign antitrust laws, file foreign direct investment
clearances in certain jurisdictions and make any filings required under the Communications Act of 1934.
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement will furnish to each other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such
other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable law relating to the exchange of information,
Tenneco and Parent have each agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to:

legal counsel with copies of all filings, presentations or material submissions made by such party with any governmental entity relating
to the Merger under the HSR Act and such other antitrust laws or with respect to any required foreign direct investment approval, which
may be redacted for confidential information or otherwise shared on an outside counsel only basis.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, Parent has the right under the Merger Agreement, subject to requirements to (i) give prior notice to, and consult
with, Tenneco, and (ii) take Tenneco’s views into account in good faith, to control and lead all communications and strategy relating to any
process under the HSR Act, any antitrust law and with respect to any foreign direct investment approval.
Parent agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly (and in any event, prior to December 31, 2022 (the “Outside Date”)) resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement under the HSR Act, any antitrust law or with respect to any required foreign direct investment approval. If any proceeding
is instituted that challenges the Merger or any transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement as in violation of the HSR Act or any other
antitrust law, or threatens to result in the denial of any required foreign direct investment approval, Parent must use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly contest and resist any such proceeding, and seek to have promptly vacated, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal. Parent further agreed, to the extent necessary to avoid or

•
offering to take or taking actions that limit or affect its freedom of action; and
•
in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order of any governmental entity is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger or any such transactions, any and all
steps (including appeals and posting of bonds) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order;
provided, however, that Parent and its subsidiaries are not obligated to take any of the foregoing actions to the extent such actions would
have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, operations or
financial condition of Tenneco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger.
In addition, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates is permitted, prior to the consummation of the Merger, to acquire or agree to acquire in any
manner, any assets or businesses, if the execution and delivery of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such
acquisition would be reasonably expected to prevent the consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date.
India Mandatory Tender Offer
Parent will effect a mandatory tender offer, following the closing of the Merger, to the public shareholders of Federal Mogul Goetze (India) Ltd.,
a Tenneco subsidiary, pursuant to Regulation 5(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and
Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 (the “India MTO”). In connection with the India MTO, Tenneco will, and will cause its subsidiaries and direct its
and their respective representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate and promptly provide such information and take such actions
as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the India MTO.
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance
After the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and will advance expenses as
incurred by, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of
Tenneco and any contract of Tenneco and its subsidiaries, in each case, in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, each present and
former director and officer of Tenneco and its subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who serves as a fiduciary of a Tenneco
benefit plan (in each case, when acting in such capacity, an “Indemnitee”), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any proceeding or investigation,
whether civil or criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, arising out of or pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
actions to enforce any indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee.
Under the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses arising from,
relating to or otherwise in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time existing as of the Effective Time in favor of an
Indemnitee (as provided in Tenneco’s and its subsidiaries’ certificate of
90
Table of Contents
incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational documents) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. For a period of no less than six years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect
the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in (i) the applicable
organizational documents in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) any contract of Tenneco or its subsidiaries in effect as of
the date of the Merger Agreement with any Indemnitee, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of Tenneco or its subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses in respect of any proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of
such proceeding.
The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to certain limits on the premium to be paid, from and for six years after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be jointly and severally responsible for maintaining for the benefit of the directors and officers of
Tenneco, as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date of the Merger, an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in
the aggregate than the existing policy of Tenneco. In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, Parent will, and
the Surviving Corporation will, cause proper provision to be made so that the successor or assign will expressly assume the obligations
described above.
Employee Matters
The Merger Agreement provides that, during the period commencing at the closing of the Merger and ending on the 12-month anniversary
thereof, each employee of Tenneco and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Employee”) will receive (i)
an annual base salary or wage rate and a target annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less than the annual base salary or wage rate
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) other compensation and benefits (excluding equity
award compensation and defined benefit pension benefits) that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to the other compensation and
benefits (excluding equity award compensation and defined benefit pension benefits) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time.
The Merger Agreement further provides that Parent will assume, or cause its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to assume,
honor and continue during the period ending on the date that is 12 months following the closing of the Merger, or if sooner, until all obligations
thereunder have been satisfied, each of Tenneco’s benefit plans, in accordance with the terms of such plans, provided that Parent is not
prohibited from amending each such plan in accordance with its terms.
If the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment of any outstanding amounts under a Tenneco fiscal 2022 cash-based short-term bonus plan,
Parent will pay at the time that Tenneco and its subsidiaries would have customarily made such bonus payments, a bonus to each employee
who continues in employment and participates in such 2022 cash-based short-term bonus plan no less than the amount earned (but not paid)
in accordance with the terms of the applicable 2022 bonus plan, and to the extent the Effective Time occurs in calendar year 2022, maintain
the 2022 bonus plans on the same terms and conditions, and with respect to the same targets and performance measures, as were in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that bonuses paid to Continuing Employees under such 2022 bonus plans will be paid at no
less than target.
The Merger Agreement also provides that, with respect to the benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all

that such prior service credit will not be recognized to the extent that it results in a duplication of benefits, and the foregoing service credit will
not apply with respect to any defined benefit plan, non-qualified deferred compensation plan, equity compensation plan or post-termination or
retiree health or welfare benefits. The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent will, or will cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts
to (i) waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of insurability, actively-at work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable
Tenneco plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit
plans in which such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Stockholder Litigation
Tenneco will give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against Tenneco
and/or its directors and officers relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger. Tenneco will

•
by mutual written consent of Tenneco and Parent;

at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, if the Board authorizes Tenneco to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the Merger Agreement
(provided that Tenneco pays the Company Termination Fee to Parent concurrently with such termination);

o
if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have not been completed on or before the Outside Date; so long
as Parent’s breach of the Merger Agreement was not the principal cause of the failure to close prior to the Outside Date;

Merger Agreement in this way if Parent is then in material breach of its representations, warranties or covenants contained
in the Merger Agreement.
In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the Merger Agreement (other than certain
provisions that expressly survive termination of the Merger Agreement) will become void and of no effect without liability or obligation on the
part of any party thereto. However, no termination of the Merger Agreement shall relieve any party from liabilities or damages incurred or
suffered as a result of a willful and material breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in the Merger
Agreement or fraud if such willful and material breach or fraud is the principal cause of a condition to the closing of the Merger to becoming
incapable of satisfaction by the Outside Date (or if capable of being satisfied by the Outside Date, to not be satisfied by the Outside Date);
provided that in no event shall the aggregate amount of liabilities and damages recoverable from either Tenneco or Parent as a result of such
willful and material breach or fraud exceed $108 million.
Company Termination Fee, Reverse Termination Fee
Company Termination Fee
Under the Merger Agreement, Tenneco must pay to Parent a fee of $54 million (the “Company Termination Fee”) if the Merger Agreement is

prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, if Tenneco terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement;

Recommendation Change or Tenneco has entered into a merger agreement, letter of intent or other similar agreement related to an
alternative Acquisition Proposal from a third party; or

if the following clauses (a), (b) and (c) are all satisfied: (a) either (i) Parent or Tenneco terminates the Merger Agreement following the
Outside Date and the Tenneco stockholder meeting has not occurred prior to the Outside Date or (ii) either Parent or Tenneco
terminates the Merger Agreement because the Tenneco stockholder meeting (as it may be adjourned) has concluded and the
Stockholder Approval has not been obtained or because Tenneco has committed a terminable breach of its representations, warranties
or covenants contained in the Merger Agreement, (b) an Acquisition Proposal made by a third party has been publicly disclosed after
the date of the Merger Agreement (except that for purposes of this bullet point, all references to “25%” in the definition of “Acquisition
Proposal” will be deemed to be references to “50%”) and (c) within 12 months of such termination Tenneco and its subsidiaries
consummate an alternative Acquisition Proposal.

Reverse Termination Fee
Under the Merger Agreement, Parent must pay to Tenneco a fee of $108 million (the “Reverse Termination Fee”) if the Merger Agreement is
terminated under the following circumstances:
•
Tenneco terminates the Merger Agreement because (or, following the Outside Date, either Tenneco or Parent terminates the Merger
Agreement if at the time of, or prior to, such termination, Tenneco would have been entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement
because) (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the conditions to Parent’s obligations to complete the Merger have been
satisfied (other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to such conditions being
capable of being satisfied), (ii) Tenneco has delivered a written notice to Parent at least three business days prior to such termination
confirming that, if Parent performed is obligations and the debt financing was funded, Tenneco is ready, willing and able to consummate
the closing and (iii) Parent has failed to consummate the closing within three business days after the later to occur of (x) delivery of the
written notice of such failure and (y) the date when the closing is required to occur under the Merger Agreement; or
•
Parent or Tenneco terminates the Merger Agreement following the Outside Date if at the time of such termination the only conditions to
the closing of the Merger that have not been waived or satisfied (other than conditions that are, by their terms, satisfied at such
closing) are the receipt of approvals, consents and consultations pursuant to the competition laws of Russia or Ukraine.
In the event either Tenneco or Parent fails to promptly pay the applicable termination fee when due and either Tenneco or Parent, as
applicable, commences a suit in order to obtain such payment and such suit resulting in a judgment against the other party for payment of
the applicable termination fee, the non-paying party will be required to pay, up to a maximum of $5 million, the other party’s and its affiliates’
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid
fee, cost or expense from the date such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid up to (but excluding) the payment date.
Specific Performance
Except as otherwise described below, the parties are entitled to injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to specific
performance as to its terms (without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with obtaining of any specific
performance or injunctive relief), in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or equity.
Until Parent pays Tenneco the Reverse Termination Fee, Tenneco’s right to specific performance is in addition to any other remedy to which it
is entitled at law or in equity in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance will
not restrict Tenneco from, in the alternative, simultaneously seeking to collect the Reverse Termination Fee. However in no circumstances will
Tenneco be entitled to receive (i) both a grant of specific performance or equitable relief, on the one hand, and payment of any monetary
damages and/or payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, on the other hand, or (ii) both payment of any monetary damages and payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee.
Tenneco’s or Parent’s pursuit of specific performance shall not preclude the pursuing party from the right to pursue any other right or remedy
to which such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the other party in
the case of a breach of the Merger Agreement involving a willful and material breach or fraud.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenneco is not entitled to specific performance of Parent’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded
and/or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, unless (i) the parties’ mutual conditions to the closing of the
Merger and the additional conditions to the closing of the Merger of Parent and Merger Sub have been satisfied or waived (other than the
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied assuming a
closing would occur),
96
Table of Contents
(ii) Parent fails to consummate the Merger by the date the closing is required to have occurred pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, (iii) the debt financing has been funded or will be funded at the closing of the Merger if the equity financing is funded at or prior to
the closing of the Merger and (iv) Tenneco has confirmed in writing that if specific performance is granted and the debt financing is funded,
then Tenneco will take such actions required to cause the closing of the Merger to occur.
Limitation on Recourse
Other than with respect to the right to specific performance of the Equity Commitment Letter (as defined in “The Merger—Financing of the
Merger”) to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter and recourse against the guarantors under the
Limited Guarantee (as defined in “The Merger—Limited Guarantee”) to the extent provided therein, any claim or cause of action under the
Merger Agreement may only be brought against persons that are expressly named as parties thereto, and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement with respect to such party. Other than claims pursuant to the Equity Commitment
Letter, the confidentiality agreement between Tenneco and Apollo Management IX L.P. and recourse against the guarantors under the Limited
Guarantee, no Tenneco-related party or Parent-related party (other than Tenneco, Parent or Merger Sub) will have any liability or obligation for
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities of Tenneco, Parent or Merger Sub or of or for any
claim, investigation or proceeding, in each case under, based on, in respect of or by reason of, the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated therein, including the Merger.
Fees and Expenses
All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, subject to certain provisions of the Merger Agreement; provided that Tenneco and Parent are each obligated to pay for
50% of any and all filing fees incurred by the parties and payable to any governmental entity in connection with any antitrust filings or other
submissions made in connection with the Merger.
Amendment and Waiver
The Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time, and any provision may be waived, provided that such amendment or
waiver is set forth in a written instrument signed by the parties. However, after receipt of the Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be
made which, by law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by Tenneco’s stockholders
without such approval. Certain customary provisions, including those regarding terminations fees, assignments, amendments and waivers,
third party beneficiaries, waiver of jury trials, governing law, jurisdiction and recourse, may not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any
debt financing source without the prior written consent of such debt financing source.
No Third Party Beneficiaries
The Merger Agreement provides that it will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. The Merger Agreement is not intended to and will not confer any rights, benefits or remedies
upon any other person other than (i) the rights of the Indemnitees and of Tenneco’s subsidiaries to enforce certain reimbursement and
indemnification obligations of Parent set forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii) the right of certain Tenneco-related parties and Parent-related
parties to enforce covenants in the Merger Agreement not to bring certain claims against such parties, (iii) the right, following the Effective
Time, for holders of Shares and Company Awards to enforce the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (iv) the right of Parent’s
financing sources and certain related parties to enforce certain provisions in the Merger Agreement.
Governing Law
The Merger Agreement is governed by and will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, provided that any disputes
involving the debt financing sources will be governed by and will be construed in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of New York.

compensation will or may become payable, the value of which is set forth in “The Merger — Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers

Stockholders should note that this proposal is separate and apart from Item #1 (the Merger Proposal) above and is not a condition to
completion of the Merger, and, as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Tenneco, the Board or Parent. Further, the underlying
plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the

based on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

to adjourn the annual meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and
approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In the event there are present, in person or by proxy,

of the adjourned meeting will be announced at the time the adjournment is taken, and no other notice need be given unless the adjournment
is for more than 30 days or Tenneco is required to change the record date of the annual meeting. Any adjournment of the annual meeting for
the purpose of soliciting additional votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by

Our Board is currently comprised of 11 directors, Roy V. Armes, Thomas C. Freyman, Denise Gray, Brian J. Kesseler, Michelle A. Kumbier,
Dennis J. Letham, James S. Metcalf, Aleksandra A. Miziolek, Charles K. Stevens, III, John S. Stroup and Jane L. Warner, all of whom,
except Ms. Warner, are proposed to be elected at this Annual Meeting to serve for a one-year term to expire at the annual meeting of
stockholders to be held in 2023 and until their successors are chosen and have been duly elected and qualified.
Unless otherwise indicated in your proxy, the persons named as proxy voters in the accompanying proxy card, or their substitutes, will vote
your proxy for all the nominees, each of whom has been designated as such by the Board. In the event that any nominee for director
withdraws or for any reason is not able to serve as a director, we will vote your proxy for the remainder of those nominated for director (except
as otherwise indicated in your proxy) and for any replacement nominee designated by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the
Board.
You may vote “For” or “Against” any or all of the director nominees, or you may “Abstain” from voting. Assuming a quorum, each director
nominee receiving a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting (in person or by proxy) will be elected as a director. A “majority of the
votes cast” means the number of “For” votes cast exceeds the number of “Against” votes cast. A proxy marked “Abstain” with respect to any
director will not be counted in determining the total number of votes cast.
If an incumbent director is not elected, that director remains in office until the director’s successor is duly elected and qualified or until the
director’s death, resignation or retirement. To address this potential outcome, the Board adopted a director resignation policy in Tenneco’s By-
Laws. Under this policy, the Board will nominate for directors only those incumbent candidates who tender, in advance, irrevocable
resignations, and the Board has obtained such conditional resignations from the nominees in this year’s proxy statement. The irrevocable
resignations will be effective upon the failure to receive the required vote at any annual meeting of stockholders at which they are nominated
for re-election and Board acceptance of the resignation. If a nominee fails to receive the required vote, the Nominating and Governance
Committee will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. The Board will publicly disclose its decision
within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. The director whose resignation is under consideration will not participate in the
recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee or the Board’s decision with respect to the resignation. If the Board does not
accept the resignation, the director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successor is duly
elected, or until their earlier resignation or removal. If the Board accepts the resignation, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any
resulting vacancy or may decrease the size of the Board (but not below the minimum number of directors required under our Certificate of
Incorporation).
Included in the incumbent directors nominated for re-election is Ms. Michelle A. Kumbier, who was appointed by the Board as a director
effective August 10, 2021, after being identified by an independent third-party search firm that was engaged by our Nominating and
Governance Committee.

We have established a comprehensive corporate governance plan for the purpose of defining responsibilities, setting high standards of

Board Leadership Structure
Our Board nominees currently are comprised of 10 directors, nine of whom are independent and one of whom is an officer of our company.
The Board believes that our ratio of outside directors to inside directors represents a commitment to the independence of the Board and a
focus on matters of importance to our stockholders.
The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles are split. The Board appointed Mr. Letham to serve as our non-executive Chairman of the
Board in July 2020. Mr. Letham presides at all meetings of stockholders and the Board. By having separate roles, the Chief Executive Officer
is able to focus on the day-to-day business and affairs of the company and the Chairman is able to focus on key strategic issues, Board
leadership and communication. Our Board believes this leadership structure is in the best interests of our company and its stockholders.
The non-management directors on the Board and each of its committees meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions without any
members of management present. The purpose of these executive sessions is to promote open and candid discussion among the non-
management directors. Our system has provided and will continue to provide appropriate checks and balances to protect stockholder value
and allows for efficient management of our company.
Our Board has three standing committees — the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance
Committee. Each of these committees consists solely of independent directors and has its own chair who is responsible for directing the
work of the committee in fulfilling its responsibilities.
Committee Membership
The Board routinely reviews Board composition to ensure that it has the right balance of skills to fulfill its oversight obligations for
Shareowners. As part of that process, the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board consider current tenure and potential
retirements.
The Board had the following standing Committees in 2021: (i) Audit; (ii) Compensation; and (iii) Nominating and Governance. The table below
provides the following Committees and Committee composition as of the date of the 2022 proxy statement:

ROLE OF BOARD IN RISK OVERSIGHT
Our Board recognizes that, although risk management is primarily the responsibility of the company’s management team, the Board plays a
critical role in the oversight of risk, including the identification and management of risk. The Board believes that an important part of its
responsibilities is to assess the major risks we face and review our strategies for monitoring and controlling these risks. The Board’s
involvement in risk oversight involves the full Board, the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance
Committee.
We perform an annual enterprise risk assessment, which originates within our internal audit department and is performed in accordance with
the standards adopted by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As part of its assessment, our internal
audit department interviews each of our directors, as well as members of management, regarding the strategic, operational, legal,
compliance, financial, environmental, safety, information technology, cybersecurity and reputational risks that our company faces. Our Vice
President of Internal Audit and Chief Financial Officer review the results of this annual enterprise risk assessment with our Board. In addition,
throughout the year, the Board meets with senior management to discuss:
•
current business trends affecting us;
•
the major risk exposures facing us; and
•
the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate such risks.
The Board receives presentations throughout the year from senior management and leaders of our business units and functional groups
regarding specific risks that we face. Finally, on an annual basis, management provides a comprehensive strategic review to the Board, which
includes a discussion of the major risks faced by our company and our strategies to manage and minimize these risks.
The Audit Committee meets frequently during the year with senior management, our Vice President of Internal Audit and our independent
public accountants and discusses the major risks facing us, and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such risks, as well
as the adequacy of internal controls that could mitigate risks that could significantly affect our financial statements. At each regularly
scheduled meeting, our Vice President of Internal Audit reviews with the Audit Committee the results of internal audit activities and testing
since the Audit Committee’s prior meeting. In addition, at each regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting, the company’s General
Counsel provides a report to the Audit Committee regarding any significant litigation, environmental and regulatory risks faced by our
company. The Audit Committee also maintains oversight over the company’s compliance programs, including compliance with the company’s
Code of Conduct. The Chair of the Audit Committee provides the Board with a report concerning its risk oversight activities at each Board
meeting. The Compensation Committee reviews our compensation structures and programs to ensure that they do not encourage excessive
risk-taking. Further, our Nominating and Governance Committee reviews our policies and strategies related to matters of sustainability and
corporate responsibility that are significant to the company and our stakeholders.
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
The Board has determined that all of our current non-management directors are “independent” as that term is defined under the listing
standards of the NYSE. As part of its analysis, the Board determined that none of the non-management directors has a direct or indirect
material relationship with our company. Under written guidelines adopted by the Board, the following commercial or charitable relationships
are not considered to be material relationships that would impair a director’s independence:
•
the director is an employee, director or beneficial owner of less than 10% of the shares of another company that (directly or indirectly
through its subsidiaries or affiliates) does business with us and the annual sales to, or purchases from, us are less than 1% of the annual
consolidated revenues of both our company and the other company;

The Nominating and Governance Committee has the responsibility, among other things,
to:
   review and determine the desirable balance of experience, qualifications and expertise among members of
the Board;
   identify possible candidates for membership on the Board and recommend a slate of nominees for election
as directors at each annual meeting of stockholders;
   review the function and composition of the other committees of the Board and recommend membership on

   oversee our director compensation program;
   develop and recommend to the Board for approval any revisions to our Corporate Governance Principles;
and
   oversee our policies and strategies related to matters of sustainability, corporate responsibility, political

The Nominating and Governance Committee operates pursuant to a written charter, the current version of which was
reaffirmed by the Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee in February 2022 as part of their annual
review process. The Nominating and Governance Committee held four meetings during 2021.
For 2021, the Nominating and Governance Committee utilized the services of Meridian, its principal outside

Governance Committee in connection with apprising the committee members regarding best practices and pay levels
in association with director compensation.
For our director compensation, Meridian prepares comparative market data and presents that information directly to
the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews this data and
establishes director compensation in consultation with Meridian.
Other than its services as a compensation consultant, Meridian provides no other services to the Nominating and
Governance Committee, the Compensation Committee or our company.

Board and whether any vacancies are expected on the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee’s process
for identifying and evaluating nominees is as follows:
   In the case of incumbent directors, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews annually such
directors’ overall service to us during their term, including the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and
skills that such directors bring to service on our Board, the number of meetings attended, the level of
participation, the quality of performance and any transactions of such directors with us during their term.

2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting
Table of Contents
   In the event that vacancies are anticipated or otherwise arise, the Nominating and Governance Committee
considers various potential candidates for director that may come to its attention through a variety of sources,
including current Board members, stockholders or other persons, including professional search firms. All
candidates for director are evaluated at regular or special meetings of the Nominating and Governance
Committee.
In evaluating and determining whether to recommend a person as a candidate for election as a director, the
Nominating and Governance Committee considers each candidate’s experience, qualifications, attributes and skills
as well as the specific qualification standards set forth in our By-Laws and Corporate Governance Principles,
including:
   personal and professional ethics, integrity and values;
   an ability and willingness to undertake the requisite time commitment to Board functions;
   independence pursuant to the guidelines set forth in the Corporate Governance Principles and applicable
rules and regulations;
   age, which must be less than 75 at the time of election unless otherwise determined in the good faith
judgment of our Board;
   the potential impact of service on the board of directors of other public companies (see “Overboarding
Policy”), including competitors of our company; and
   an absence of employment at a competitor of our company.
The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board value diversity and believe that a diverse Board
composition provides significant benefit to our company. Each candidate is reviewed in light of the overall composition
and skills of the entire Board at the time, including the varied characteristics of the Board members and candidate in
terms of opinions, perspectives, personal and professional experiences and backgrounds. The nominees selected
are those whose experience and background are deemed to provide the most valuable contribution to the Board. The
Board previously adopted the “Rooney Rule” under which the Board set forth in its Corporate Governance Guidelines
the Nominating and Governance Committee’s commitment to include, in each pool of qualified candidates from which
director nominees are chosen, candidates who bring gender, racial, ethnic and cultural diversity.
Our By-Laws permit, under certain circumstances, a stockholder or group of no more than 20 stockholders (meeting
our continuous ownership requirement of 3% or more of our outstanding common stock held continuously for at least
the previous three years) to nominate a candidate or candidates for election to the Board at an annual meeting of
stockholders, constituting up to two directors or 20% of the number of directors then serving on the Board (rounded
down to the nearest whole number), whichever is greater. In order to require us to include such candidate or
candidates in our proxy statement and form of proxy, stockholders and nominees must submit a notice of proxy
access nomination together with certain related information required by our By-Laws.
Our By-Laws also permit stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting to nominate directors for consideration at an
annual meeting of stockholders without requiring that their nominees be included in our proxy statement and form of
proxy. Stockholders may nominate persons for election to the Board at an annual meeting of stockholders by
submitting a letter of nomination, together with certain related information required by our By-Laws.
Pursuant to our By-Laws, written notice by stockholders of qualifying nominations for election to the Board must have
been received by our Corporate Secretary by February 13, 2022.
Correspondence related to stockholder proposals must be sent in writing to our Corporate Secretary at our principal
executive offices. For more information on submitting a nomination, visit www.tenneco.com or see “Submission of
Stockholder Proposals.”

Audit Committee
Meetings
in 2021
Management is responsible for maintaining our internal controls over financial reporting. Our independent public
accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and for issuing a report on its audit.
The Audit Committee’s duty is to oversee and monitor these activities on behalf of the Board. Specifically, the Audit
Committee has the responsibility, among other things, to:
   select and approve the compensation of our independent public accountants;
   review and approve the scope of the independent public accountants’ audit activity and all non-audit
services;
   review the independence, qualifications and performance of our independent public accountants;
   review with management and the independent public accountants the adequacy of our basic accounting
system and the effectiveness of our internal audit plan and activities;
   review with management and the independent public accountants our certified financial statements and
exercise general oversight over the financial reporting process;
   review litigation and other legal matters that may affect our financial condition and monitor compliance with
business ethics and other policies;
   provide an avenue of communication among the independent public accountants, management, the internal
auditors and the Board; and
   prepare the audit-related report required by the SEC to be included in our annual proxy statement.
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed with management and our independent public
accountants:
   significant issues, if any, regarding accounting principles and financial statement presentations, including
any significant changes in our selection or application of accounting principles, and significant issues, if any, as
to the adequacy of our internal controls and any special audit steps adopted in view of material internal control
deficiencies;
   analyses prepared by management and/or our independent public accountants setting forth significant
financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation of our financial statements,
including analyses of the effects of alternative generally accepted accounting principles methods on financial
statements;
   the effect of regulatory and accounting initiatives, as well as off-balance sheet structures, if any, on our
financial statements; and
   the type and presentation of information to be included in earnings press releases, as well as any financial
information and earnings guidance provided to analysts and rating agencies.
In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed our major risk exposures and the steps that management has taken
to monitor and control such exposures. Management is required to advise the Audit Committee of any instances of
fraud relating to employees who have a significant role in our internal controls.
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter, the current version of which was reaffirmed by the Board and
the Audit Committee in February 2022 as part of their annual review process. The Audit Committee held seven
meetings in 2021. A report of the Audit Committee appears elsewhere in this proxy statement.

As part of our overall corporate governance, we have an on-going outreach program to develop and maintain communication with our investors
in regard to governance and compensation issues. In 2021, members of senior management continued our expanded governance outreach in
order to solicit stockholder perspectives and receive valuable, direct feedback on governance, executive compensation, sustainability and
related matters. Our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) outreach materials are available for viewing on our public website. This
outreach was in addition to management’s regular participation in investor, community, industry and analyst conferences and meetings
throughout the year to discuss performance, ESG topics, and share its perspective on business and industry developments. We value these
discussions and the feedback received from stockholders, which is reviewed with our Board, and will help promote greater alignment of our
ESG and executive compensation practices with stockholders interests. Stockholders may also contact the Board with any inquiry or issue,
by the methods described in this proxy statement and the Board will respond as appropriate.

In accordance with our Corporate Governance Principles, directors are encouraged to restrict the number of public company boards on which
they serve which helps ensure that other commitments, including outside board memberships, do not interfere with their duties and
responsibilities as Board members. A director may not serve on the boards of more than four other public companies (including our own) or, if
the director is an active CEO or equivalent of another public company, on the boards of more than two other public companies (including our
own). In addition, directors must notify the Nominating and Governance Committee chair, chairman of the Board and the general counsel upon
accepting any other public company directorship or any assignment to the audit committee or compensation committee (or any committees
performing similar functions) of the board of directors of any public company of which such director is a board member. All directors are in
compliance with the Company’s overboarding policy as of the date of this proxy statement. Compliance with this policy is reviewed at least
annually during the normal director and officer questionnaire process.

and communities build a sustainable future. Additionally, we strive for a safe and healthy work environment for our team members and aim to
exceed expectations across our value chain and in communities where we operate. While ultimate oversight for ESG topics falls under the
purview of the entire Board, each Board committee has various responsibilities connected to ESG matters. We provide public reporting and
are forthcoming in disclosures about our environmental stewardship and long-term strategy, including voluntarily reporting our ESG strategy
and related data to CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project).
We have implemented a cross functional ESG Council which advises management periodically on progress and determines how to drive long-
term shareholder value. The ESG Council comprises functional leaders of Environmental, Health and Safety, Legal, Human Resources and
Talent Management, Finance, Engineering, Supply Chain and Logistics. Our Senior Vice President and Chief ESG Officer, reporting to the
CEO, drives our ESG program and collaborates with our other executive leaders to implement our ESG strategy. This role enables a holistic

receives information technology and cybersecurity updates that focus on program governance, control maturity and third party information
security assurance at least twice per year, with the Board receiving a similar briefing once per year. Additionally, ad-hoc matters of interest,
key risks, applicable threat intelligence and relevant industry news are provided to the Board and Audit Committee throughout the year as
needed.
The Company also maintains a standing information security and privacy executive steering committee which meets regularly during the year
and at a minimum, in advance of Board and Audit Committee sessions. This steering committee is responsible for approving the
organization’s information security charter and authority to operate, as well as setting the tone demonstrating the importance of information
security and privacy risk management as critical business issues. This committee discusses information security and privacy matters of
significance, program governance, strategy, information security risk management investments and metrics governing the program’s evolution.

In connection with the closing of our acquisition of Federal-Mogul LLC, on October 1, 2018, the company, Icahn Enterprises L.P., American
Entertainment Properties Corp. and Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. (collectively, “IEP”) entered into a Shareholders Agreement (the
“Shareholders Agreement”).
IEP had the right to convert its shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock, provided that any such conversion did
not result in IEP and its affiliates owning more than 15% of the issued and outstanding shares of class A common stock. IEP and its affiliates
were prohibited from acquiring, offering to acquire, or agreeing to acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of class A common stock or other
securities until April 1, 2021.
As part of the Federal-Mogul acquisition, the company acquired a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to a subsidiary in India. In
accordance with local regulations, as a result of the change in control triggered by the acquisition, the company was required to make a
tender offer to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of the subsidiary. The company entered into agreements with IEP subsequent to
executing the purchase agreement whereby IEP agreed to fund and execute the tender offer on behalf of the company.
We are a party to supply contracts with The Pep Boys—Manny, Moe & Jack (“Pep Boys”) and IEH Auto Parts LLC (“Auto Plus”). Pep Boys
and Auto Plus are owned by Icahn Enterprises L.P. In early 2021, Icahn Enterprises L.P. indirectly held more than 5% of our class A common
stock. We have negotiated and continue to negotiate supply contracts with Pep Boys and Auto Plus which we believe are favorable to us. Net
sales to Pep Boys and Auto Plus for fiscal year 2021, were $16 million and $122 million, respectively. Such sales were made and are
continuing to be made in the ordinary course of our business. We are also a party to certain other minor arrangements with IEP subsidiaries
totaling less than $3 million in 2021, including among other ordinary course items: (i) purchases from Pep Boys; and (ii) sales in the ordinary
course of our business to Coffeyville Resources, LLC.
Based on publicly available information, during the second quarter of 2021, IEP and its subsidiaries no longer owned 5% or more of the
Company’s Class A Common Stock and were no longer considered related parties of the Company.
Additionally, in the ordinary course of our business, we engage in transactions with Briggs & Stratton, LLC (“Briggs & Stratton”). For 2021,
our transactions with Briggs & Stratton totaled approximately $12 million. In March 2022, Michelle Kumbier, a member of our Board of
Directors, joined Briggs & Stratton as senior vice president and president – Turf and Consumer Products. We intend to continue to engage in
business with Briggs & Stratton in the ordinary course and, to the extent required, any such further business will be reviewed and approved by

Our corporate strategy is focused on continuing to make operational improvements, reducing structural costs, lowering capital intensity and
reducing net debt. In 2020, we introduced a corporate campaign, encouraging the organization to focus on reducing our net debt by the end of
2023.
Our performance-based awards – annual cash incentives under the Tenneco Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”) and long-term performance stock
units (“PSUs”) under our long-term incentive plan – are measured against metrics that are consistent with achieving our corporate strategy.
Subject to an individual performance factor, payout under the AIP is based 50% on enterprise-level adjusted earnings before interest expense,
income taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-controlling interests (“Enterprise EBITDA”) and 50% on enterprise free cash flow
(“Enterprise FCF”) because we continue to believe that strong Enterprise EBITDA and Enterprise FCF performance are correlated with
stockholder returns and that making business and investment decisions based on Enterprise EBITDA and Enterprise FCF balances cash-
oriented and earnings-oriented results. For 2021, the committee approved a design change to the AIP such that overall company performance
will be subject to an individual performance multiplier for each named executive officer of 0% to 150%, based on the named executive officer’s
performance as determined by the committee (with a named executive officer’s payout remaining capped at 200% of his target payout except
as otherwise determined by the committee). Among other metrics that influence the individual performance multiplier, we included social
metrics because we recognize that accountability for ensuring a culture of inclusion, diversity and equity is paramount to overall business
success. Understanding, measuring and rewarding the right priorities will ensure we meet our goals and support the right culture for the
future. The committee also modified the measurement of Enterprise FCF for purposes of the AIP to focus on the reduction of net debt to be
consistent with the 2B/23 strategy.
Our long-term performance share units (“PSUs”) awarded for the 2021 through 2023 performance period will be measured based on (i)
Enterprise EBITDA (50%), consistent with 2020 PSU awards, and (ii) enterprise net leverage ratio (50%) (“Enterprise Net Leverage Ratio”),
which metric replaced the free cash flow metric that applied to 2020 awards. EBITDA performance will be measured over the 2021 through
2023 performance period. Enterprise Net Leverage Ratio performance will be measured at the end of 2023. The committee determined that
using Enterprise Net Leverage Ratio as a performance metric would align with future cash flow objectives and offer a differentiation from the
short-term and long-term metrics. These awards will be settled in stock.

Key decisions and pay outcomes under our 2021 executive compensation program included:
·
At the outset of the year (February 2021), the committee reviewed the base salaries of those named executive officers then employed
by the company, other than Mr. Kesseler, and approved increases in base salaries that ranged between 0% and 3.2% over 2020. Base
salary increases were determined based on performance and whether the executive had received a base salary increase in 2020. Mr.
Kesseler’s base salary remained the level last reviewed and approved in the Fall of 2020 as previously disclosed.
·
In November 2021, the company reviewed the peer group which was previously established in July 2020 for compensation benchmarking
purposes. No changes to the peer group were made.
·
Annual cash incentives based on 2021 results were declared in early 2022 as follows:
AIP payout
Taking into account a calculation 50% based on Enterprise EBITDA and 50% based on Enterprise FCF performance
of the company, each named executive officer was eligible to receive an AIP payout equal to 100% of his target
payout (“Eligible Payout”).
Each named executive officer’s final AIP payout was determined by multiplying his Eligible Payout by his individual
performance factor as determined by the committee: Mr. Kesseler – 110%, Mr. Masanovich—115%, Mr. Baird—91%,
Mr. Jueckstock—75% and Mr. Norton—93%.
124Table of Contents
·
Long-term incentives for the 2019 through 2021 performance period, which were granted in early 2019, were determined in early 2022
and earned as follows:
PSUs payout
Messrs. Kesseler and Norton, as holders of PSUs granted by the company in 2019, earned their PSUs for the 2019
through 2021 performance period at 100% of target level and Mr. Jueckstock, as a holder of PSUs granted by the
company in 2019, earned his PSUs for the 2019 through 2021 performance period at 40% based on metrics as
described below.
No PSUs
granted
Messrs. Masanovich and Baird did not hold any PSUs or awards in respect of the 2019 through 2021 performance
period.
Impact of 2020-2022 PSU Grant on 2021 Compensation
For accounting reasons described below, each named executive officer’s 2020-2022 PSU award granted in early 2020 was not reflected in the
Summary Compensation Table as 2020 compensation. Instead, the value of these 2020 awards is required to be included in the Summary
Compensation Table as 2021 compensation, which results in 2021 compensation including two annual performance award grants and thus
appearing higher than it otherwise would.
Due to the uncertainty created by COVID in 2020, the committee did not establish performance metrics under the 2020-2022 PSUs during the
course of 2020 despite establishing a target level of payout for each named executive officer at the beginning of 2020 consistent with normal
practice. Over the course of 2020, the committee periodically revisited the long-term performance program, but continued to defer establishing
performance goals due to ongoing COVID uncertainty. In November 2020, the committee converted the dollar value targets into units based on
the 10-day volume weighted average price for the period ended March 4, 2020 in order to align executive compensation with the financial
interests of our stockholders, with the PSUs to be settled in cash. At the time, the committee also determined that financial performance for
2020 would not be a factor in these awards but instead that the committee would establish targets for 2021 and 2022 in 2021.
Consequently, because the compensation committee determined to establish performance targets in 2021 for the 2020-2022 PSUs, these
awards had no grant date fair value in 2020 under applicable accounting rules and were not permitted to be included in the Summary
Compensation Table as 2020 compensation. Instead, they are included as 2021 compensation in the Summary Compensation Table.
Below sets forth, for each named executive officer, i) the intended dollar value of the PSU awards granted in 2020 for the 2020 through 2022
performance period, ii) what the aggregate pro forma total compensation would have been for 2020 had the grant date fair value of 2020-2022
PSU award been reported in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation for 2020, and iii) what the aggregate pro forma total

Results of Say-on-Pay Vote and Stockholder Engagement
Our stockholders hold an annual advisory vote on executive compensation (the “say-on-pay proposal”). At our annual meeting of stockholders
held in May 2021, approximately 71% of the shares present and entitled to vote on our say-on-pay proposal were voted in favor of the
proposal. Excluding abstentions, approximately 91% of the shares voted were voted in favor of the proposal. As part of our overall corporate
governance, we have an on-going outreach program to develop and maintain communication with our investors. Throughout 2021, members of
our management team continued to engage in stockholder outreach with our largest stockholders, highlighting a number of key topics,
including our approach to executive compensation, and environmental, social and governance matters. We value this engagement and the
Board considers pertinent feedback when evaluating compensation and governance issues. The committee will continue to consider the
outcome of the annual say-on-pay proposal when making future compensation decisions for our executives. Further, we will continue to
actively engage with stockholders as needed to receive their feedback.

In determining competitive compensation, the committee engages Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (“Meridian”), a nationally recognized
compensation consulting firm that, in order to maintain its independence, reports directly to the committee.
For our Chief Executive Officer, Meridian provided market data regarding salary, annual cash incentive award targets, and equity-based and
other long-term incentive compensation awards directly to the committee as it makes decisions with respect to compensation. For the other
named executive officers, Mr. Kesseler formulated the initial recommendations regarding salary, annual cash incentive award targets and
equity-based and other long-term incentive compensation awards. The committee reviewed these recommendations in light of market data
prepared by

Meridian. For other forms of compensation and benefits, management generally makes initial recommendations that are considered by the
committee.
Our general policy is to provide salary, annual cash incentive payments and equity-based and other long-term incentive compensation to
named executive officers that is competitive with the market and comparable companies when financial and qualitative performance targets
are met. Actual salaries may vary reasonably below or above the median when considering scope of responsibilities and experience,
development opportunity, changes in responsibilities, and individual and business performance. In making its determinations regarding these
elements of compensation, the committee regularly reviews data regarding compensation practices at other companies that it determines to
be relevant to compensation matters affecting our company.
The benchmarking information we use in establishing salary, annual cash incentive payments and equity-based and other long-term incentive
compensation typically includes the most recently available data regarding publicly traded companies comparable to our company in terms of
industry, proximity, annual revenue and/or other factors. For 2021 compensation determinations, specific data was reviewed regarding a
comparison group consisting of the following companies:

In addition, the committee reviewed aggregate data regarding a broader group of durable goods manufacturers (that were not specifically
identified to the committee). This data was prepared by Meridian and compared targeted compensation paid by these companies to their
executive officers in specified positions to the compensation we pay to named executive officers in the same or similar positions.
For 2021, Mr. Kesseler reviewed with and recommended to the committee the annual salary, incentive plan target and equity-based and other
long-term compensation for each of our named executive officers and other key management personnel (excluding Mr. Kesseler). The
committee reviewed those recommendations and made a final determination with respect to such compensation.
In general, the compensation that is developed for each of the named executive officers is based on competitive market data and on
recommendations regarding the executive’s overall contributions, past performance and anticipated future contributions. The committee also
reviews the executive’s performance separately and sets the salary, incentive plan target and equity-based and other long-term compensation
of the Chief Executive Officer based on competitive market data as well as the committee’s assessment of the Chief Executive Officer’s past
performance and anticipated future contributions.

Our compensation program generally provides that, as an employee’s level of responsibility increases, a greater portion of their potential total
compensation is based on company performance and varies in accordance with the market price of our common stock. This results in greater
potential variability in the individual’s total compensation from year to year. In designing and administering the components of the executive
compensation program, the committee strives to balance short- and long-term incentive objectives and to employ prudent judgment when
establishing performance criteria, evaluating performance and determining actual incentive payments.
In general, we use the benchmarking data described above to allocate between annual compensation and long-term compensation (excluding
retirement benefits) and between cash compensation and equity compensation. The following is a description of each element of our
executive compensation program, along with a discussion of the decisions of, and actions taken by, the committee with respect to each such
aspect of compensation for 2021.
Salary and Annual Cash Incentive Compensation
For 2021, an executive’s basic annual cash compensation package consisted primarily of a base salary and the opportunity to earn
payments under the AIP.
At the outset of 2021, salary increases were 0% for Mr. Kesseler, 3.2 % for Mr. Masanovich, 2.9% for Mr. Baird, 0% for Mr. Jueckstock, and
3% for Mr. Norton over 2020 levels and consistent with market movement and appropriate performance-related adjustments. As previously
disclosed, Mr. Kesseler’s salary was last reviewed and approved in the Fall of 2020 to reflect his promotion to the sole Chief Executive Officer
role in 2020. The 2021 salary levels established for our named executive officers were designed to be, in general, in the 50th percentile range
when compared to the salaries set by the companies in the compensation surveys reviewed as set forth above. In connection with Mr.
Norton’s transition to Executive Vice President, Business Operations Excellence, he received a one-time equity grant; there were no changes
to his base salary or his AIP bonus target.
The following table shows the base salary and 2021 annual AIP bonus target for each named executive officer for 2021:

The AIP target payment levels established for our named executive officers for 2021 were also designed to be, in general, in the 50th
percentile range when compared to target levels for similar payments set by the companies in the compensation surveys reviewed as
described above. Like executives at peer companies, our named executive officers had the potential to earn payouts above or below the target
under the AIP based on our actual performance. In 2021, we used performance metrics based on Enterprise EBITDA and Enterprise FCF for
the AIP because we continue to believe that strong Enterprise EBITDA and Enterprise FCF performance are correlated with stockholder
returns and that making business and investment decisions based on Enterprise EBITDA and Enterprise FCF balances cash-oriented and
earnings-oriented results.
Under the AIP, our management developed Enterprise EBITDA and Enterprise FCF goals for the company and recommended them to the
committee. The committee reviewed those goals, other information provided by management and performance data provided by Meridian and
adopted the goals the committee determined appropriate.
Tenneco Inc.
129
2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents
Under the AIP and subject to the individual performance factor described below, 50% of a named executive officer’s award is based on a
formula tied to our corporate achievement of pre-established Enterprise EBITDA performance goals and the other 50% of a named executive
officer’s award is based on a formula tied to our corporate achievement of pre-established Enterprise FCF goals. These performance metrics
are used to determine the base percentage of his target AIP award that each named executive officer is eligible to receive (the “Eligible
Payout”). Each named executive officer’s final AIP payout is determined by multiplying his Eligible Payout by his individual performance factor
as determined by the committee. Among other metrics that influence the individual performance multiplier, we included social metrics
because we recognize that accountability for ensuring a culture of inclusion, diversity and equity is paramount to overall business success.
Understanding, measuring and rewarding the right priorities will ensure we meet our goals and support the right culture for the future. The
terms of the AIP allow the committee to adjust the award based on factors that the committee considers relevant. Each participant’s payout
under the AIP is capped at two times their target, except as the committee otherwise determines.
For 2021, target performance under the AIP as established was $1,330 million for Enterprise EBITDA and $315 million for Enterprise FCF. An
executive would have been eligible to receive an Eligible Payout equal to 200% of target if Enterprise EBITDA had been at least $1,463 million
and Enterprise FCF had been at least $472 million. Our actual Enterprise EBITDA performance was $1,272 million and our actual FCF was
$348 million, which was the level of performance required for the EBITDA-based portion of the AIP bonus to be established at 78% of the
target level and the Enterprise FCF-based portion of the AIP bonus to be established at 121% of the target level. Due to one day of ocean
freight inventory that was either trapped at port or had extended in-transit lead time, the committee approved an adjustment of approximately
75% of this uncontrollable impact to Enterprise FCF equal to $28 million. See “— Calculations Under Our Annual Incentive Plan” for a
description of how our Enterprise EBITDA and Enterprise FCF are calculated under the AIP.
For each named executive officer, the individual performance factor determined by the committee (which was multiplied by the named
executive officer’s Eligible Payout to arrive at his final AIP payout for 2021) was as follows:
•
Mr. Kesseler – 110%
As the Chief Executive Officer of Tenneco, Mr. Kesseler’s individual performance factor was significantly weighted on setting the
strategic direction for the enterprise and the achievement of Enterprise financial results, with overperformance in Enterprise FCF
generation while managing significant headwinds. As the lead sponsor for the creation and deployment of the Inclusion, Diversity and
Equity (“ID&E”) program at Tenneco, Mr. Kesseler was instrumental in the marked progress of our ID&E efforts whereby we improved our
global female executive representation (>30%) and executive US minority representation (>60%), added a Senior Vice President,
Environmental, Social and Governance to the Senior Leadership Team and continued diversifying the members of our Board of Directors.
•
Mr. Masanovich – 115%
Being the Chief Financial Officer of the company, Mr. Masanovich’s individual performance factor was heavily weighted on the
overperformance of the Enterprise FCF results. Under Mr. Masanovich’s leadership, he drove greater efficiency, focus, capability, and
improvements within the finance discipline.
•
Mr. Baird – 91%
As the Chief Operating Officer of Tenneco, Mr. Baird’s individual performance factor was significantly impacted by the operational
performance of the enterprise, which included considerable outperformance by the Motorparts business group, but also mixed
performance from the other businesses. Mr. Baird contributed to the deployment of our ID&E program and its subsequent results.
•
Mr. Jueckstock – 75%
A significant portion of Mr. Jueckstock’s individual performance factor was based on the financial performance of the Powertrain
business group. Although the business group’s EBITDA was better than plan, the free cash flow results were worse, driven primarily by
inventory and material cost escalation.
130
Table of Contents
•
Mr. Norton – 93%
During 2021, Mr. Norton transitioned from the Performance Solutions business group to the enterprise level. Mr. Norton supported the
continued growth in key businesses through Value Stream Simplification (VSS) efforts by prioritizing and aligning spending toward
growth engines. VSS is actively engaged in most regions and has aided margin improvement in certain business lines. Mr. Norton’s
individual performance factor was prorated for the period he led the Performance Solutions business group, which underperformed
against plan for the year.

Long-Term and Stock-Based Incentives
Our long-term and stock-based incentive plans have been designed to align a significant portion of executive compensation with stockholder
interests. The current long-term incentive plan permits a variety of awards including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
stock equivalent units and performance units. These awards are based on an analysis of competitive levels of similar awards.
The company’s long-term and stock-based compensation program has been comprised of:
•
awards of stock-settled or cash-settled restricted stock units (“RSUs”) which generally vest in 1/3 increments over three years, and
•
awards of stock-settled or cash-settled long-term performance share units (“PSUs”) which are generally earned over a three-year
performance period and paid after the end of the performance period.
Each year, typically at its meeting in February, the committee reviews and approves long-term incentive award amounts earned for the most
recent performance period, and determines the size, nature and distribution of long-term and stock-based grants for our named executive
officers for the new year. In addition, during the course of the year the committee may grant additional awards covering partially completed
performance periods in connection with new hires or promotions.
In general, the amount of these awards has been designed by the committee to target value for our named executive officers in the range of
the 50th percentile when compared to the value of similar awards granted by peer companies to their executives, based on the committee’s
assumptions regarding future company performance and other factors. In February 2021, the committee reviewed total compensation for the
CEO. Based on a review of market data and the CEO’s exceptional performance during significant headwinds, the committee increased Mr.
Kesseler’s 2021 target long-term incentive award to $7.5M. The award was intended to increase retentive value, as well as continue the focus
on long-term value creation. The CEO’s resulting total target compensation is somewhat above the 50th percentile of 2020 target total
compensation of the peer group.

2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting
Table of Contents
For 2021, the committee determined that the time-vested RSUs awarded as part of our long-term incentive compensation would be, in
general, settled 100% in stock (rather than the mix of cash- and stock-settled RSUs that were awarded for 2020). However, due to limitations
in the company’s long-term incentive plan in effect at the time, Mr. Kesseler’s 2021 RSU grant consisted of 200,000 stock-settled RSUs and
71,250 cash-settled RSUs.
The PSUs granted by the committee in 2019 were issued in anticipation of a separation of our company into two separate companies and
were designed to be earned 50% based on the free cash flow of the business segment in which the executive was expected to be employed
following separation (“Division FCF”) and 50% based on our total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of companies in a peer group
selected by the committee.
For the PSUs granted by the committee in 2019, a named executive officer would earn a percentage of the target number of PSUs subject to
the applicable award (“Target PSUs”) based on performance as set forth below.

The committee’s target levels of performance for the 2019 through 2021 period for relative TSR and our actual level of performance were as
follows. For 50% of the PSU opportunity, each named executive officer earned 0% of his opportunity because the company’s relative TSR
performance was below the threshold required for any payout (with the 25th percentile being the threshold for minimum payout). For the
remaining 50% of the PSU opportunity, each named executive officer received a payout based on their Division FCF performance. Division
FCF for Motorparts and Performance Solutions was $1,389 and for Clean Air and Powertrain was $1,807. As a result, Messrs. Kesseler,
Jueckstock and Norton received payout of their 2019 through 2021 PSUs at 100%, 40% and 100% of target, respectively. None of the other
named executive officers held PSUs for the 2019 through 2021 performance period.

In January 2015, we entered into an offer letter with Mr. Kesseler that was amended on October 1, 2018 which is described further below.
In October 2018, we entered into an offer letter with Mr. Jueckstock that is described further below.

In July 2020, we entered into offer letters with each of Messrs. Baird and Masanovich which are described further below.
Retirement Plans
We offer to our U.S.-based salaried employees, including our U.S.-based named executive officers, customary, tax-qualified defined
contribution retirement (401(k)) plans. Beginning in 2007 (for Tenneco employees) and 2019 (for Federal-Mogul employees) the defined
contribution plans provide for a company match on employee contributions of 100% on the first 3% of an employee’s pay and 50% on the
next 2% of an employee’s pay, which we believe to be in line with prevailing practices for major U.S. corporations. In addition to this matching
contribution, we also provide a company contribution (called a “Company Retirement Contribution”) which is a percentage of a participant’s
compensation (between 2.5% and 4% for years beginning in 2021) that is determined based on the individual’s age. Participants are eligible
to receive Company Retirement Contributions after they have completed 12 months of service with the company.
We also maintain unfunded non-qualified defined contribution retirement plans (the “Excess Benefit Plans”). Our named executive officers and
other senior managers are eligible to participate in an Excess Benefit Plan, with allocations under the plans generally calculated in the same
manner as under the applicable existing defined contribution retirement plans, except that (i) Company Retirement Contributions under the
plans are made based on compensation that includes bonus compensation payable in accordance with the AIP formula (or other annual
bonus formula in effect at the relevant time) and (ii) contributions under the plans are based on compensation in excess of the Section 401(a)
(17) limitations of the Internal Revenue Code.
Tenneco Inc.
133
2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents
Under the terms of his offer, Mr. Kesseler was entitled to receive an Excess Benefit Plan contribution of 3% of compensation (including bonus
compensation) through December 31, 2019. Thereafter, Mr. Kesseler’s benefit under the Excess Benefit Plan is to be determined in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Excess Benefit Plan.
For U.S.-based executives we (and Federal-Mogul prior to the acquisition) previously offered defined benefit retirement plans that were
customary for the automotive industry and, in the case of the Tenneco plans, were consistent with similar plans maintained by the
consolidated Tenneco Inc. prior to our becoming a stand-alone public company in 1999. These plans included:
·
a customary tax-qualified retirement plan that was generally available to all U.S.-based salaried employees (see “— Post-Employment
Compensation”); and
·
a supplemental executive retirement plan for Tenneco executives for periods prior to January 1, 2007, which we call the “SRP” (see “—
Post-Employment Compensation —Supplemental Retirement Plan”).
Although benefits under both the qualified defined benefit plans and the SRP were frozen, prior earned benefits under the plans were
preserved.
Mr. Jueckstock, a native of Germany, participates in a defined benefit schedule of the Federal-Mogul German Pension Plan in lieu of the U.S.
defined contribution plan. The company makes contributions not to exceed 125,000 Euros per year to the Federal-Mogul German Pension
Plan on his behalf pursuant to his offer letter.
Perquisites
As part of our competitive compensation plan, the NEOs are eligible for limited perquisites provided by or paid for by the company. We offer
the NEOs and certain eligible executives an executive annual physical, which some chose to utilize in 2021. Perquisites provided are
reviewed on a regular basis. For each named executive officer, the aggregate value of any such perquisites to each such executive was less
than $10,000.
Severance Benefits
We have agreed to pay our Chief Executive Officer two times his then-current salary and two times target bonus for the year in which
termination occurs if we terminate his employment other than for disability, cause or in connection with a change in control. We view these
benefits as customary and a key element of the recruiting and retention of executives in light of company and industry specific factors.
We maintain a Severance Benefit Plan that applies to all U.S. salaried, full-time employees with at least three months of service who are
terminated by us without cause or in connection with a reduction in force or similar layoff. The benefits payable under this plan are described
under “— Other Potential Post-Employment Compensation — Severance Benefits.” We most recently amended the plan in April 2020 to
reflect prevailing market practices.
Change in Control
We maintain a Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives (the “CIC Executive Severance Plan”) to enable us to retain and
motivate highly qualified employees by eliminating, to the maximum practicable extent, any concern that their job security or benefit
entitlements will be jeopardized by a “change in control” of our company.
As of year-end, our plan applied to thirteen members of management. The CIC Executive Severance Plan generally provides for cash benefits
consisting primarily of a multiple (two or three times) of an officer’s annual salary and annual targeted cash incentive if the executive officer is
actually terminated (other than for cause, death or disability) or constructively terminated on or within two years following a change in control.
See “Post-Employment Compensation — Other Potential Post-Employment Compensation — Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for
Key Executives.” We amended and restated our CIC Executive Severance Plan in November 2020 to reflect current market practices and to
conform the provisions to certain other plans that we maintain, including updating the definition of change in
134
Table of Contents
control thereunder and eliminating the parachute tax gross-up provisions which have not applied to any of our executives for several years. Mr.
Kesseler’s cash payment in connection with a change in control termination will equal three times the total of his then current base salary
plus his targeted annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control. The cash payment in connection with a change in control
termination for each of Messrs. Masanovich, Baird, Jueckstock and Norton will equal two times the total of his then current base salary plus
his targeted annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control.
In addition, the terms of our 2006 LTIP (and our prior long-term incentive plans), provided for awards to vest upon a change in control, unless
the committee otherwise provides in an award agreement. Effective for grants of awards made on or after November 5, 2020, including for
grants made under the current long-term incentive plan, we amended the 2021 LTIP to eliminate the single trigger vesting. For a more detailed
description of the treatment of awards upon a change in control see “Post-Employment Compensation — Other Potential Post-Employment
Compensation — Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives.”
EQUITY AWARD POLICY",141,143
TENNECO INC_20220426_DEFM14A_20034100_4448087.Pdf,Equity Award Policy,"EQUITY AWARD POLICY
Our Board has adopted a formal policy regarding compensatory awards in the form of our common stock or any common stock derivative,
such as restricted stock, options, stock appreciation rights and stock equivalent units. Under the policy, in general, equity awards must be
approved by the committee or the Board. Typically, the committee will make annual awards that it determines to be appropriate at its meeting
held in February. The committee also has the authority to make interim awards in its discretion. The strike price of any option or stock
appreciation right must be the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant.
Our policy also permits a committee of management to make awards in certain cases. The management committee consists of our Chief
Executive Officer, General Counsel and our Chief Human Resources Officer. The management committee has the authority to make equity
awards to (i) newly hired employees and (ii) employees who are promoted during the course of a year. The awards can be made only in
amounts necessary to provide the employee with awards consistent with the amount of awards most recently made to employees of the
same salary grade level, prorated based on when the employee was hired or promoted. The total number of shares that the management
committee can issue within a single calendar year under this policy is 100,000. Further, the management committee may not exceed two
times an employee’s base salary and up to a maximum of $1,000,000 grant value to any individual unless otherwise provided for by board
resolution. The management committee is not authorized to make awards to new or promoted employees whom we would typically consider
to be at the most senior management or executive officer level.

management’s and stockholders’ interests and we based the guidelines on practices at comparable companies. The individual guidelines are:

Annual Base Salary for
the Chief Executive
Officer
The committee may, from time to time, temporarily suspend or reevaluate and revise
participants’ guidelines to give effect to changes in our common stock price or other
factors the committee deems relevant. Shares that count towards satisfaction of the
guidelines include: (i) shares owned outright by the participant or an immediate family
member that shares the same household; (ii) shares held in our defined contribution
plans; (iii) restricted stock issued by us, whether or not vested; (iv) unvested time-
vesting restricted stock units issued and held as part of long-term compensation; and
(v) shares issued upon stock option exercises or vesting of any long-term
compensation award that the participant continues to hold.
Participants are required to achieve their guideline within five years of becoming subject
to the guidelines. The committee reviews each participant’s compliance (or progress
towards compliance) with the guidelines annually, typically at its meeting in February.
In its discretion, the committee may impose conditions, restrictions or limitations on
any non-compliant participant as the committee determines to be necessary or
appropriate.
All of our non-management directors and executive officers, including the named
executive officers, are in compliance with the guidelines either through maintaining the
requisite level of ownership or being within the “ramp-up” period to achieve the requisite
level of ownership under the policy or relying on the committee’s discretion to re-assess
guidelines to give effect to unexpected volatility in our stock price.

Anti-Pledging
Policy
We have adopted a policy under which our directors and executive officers are prohibited from pledging our securities as
collateral for a loan.
Clawback
Policy
We have a policy whereby we will, in all appropriate circumstances, require reimbursement of any annual incentive
payment or long-term incentive payment to an executive officer where: (1) the payment was predicated upon achieving
certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a substantial restatement of our financial statements filed
with the SEC; (2) our Board determines the executive engaged in intentional misconduct that caused or substantially
caused the need for the substantial restatement; and (3) a lower payment would have been made to the executive based
upon the restated financial results. In each such instance, we will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover from the
individual executive the amount by which the individual executive’s incentive payments for the relevant period exceeded the
lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.

In general, our philosophy is to seek to preserve the tax deductibility of executive compensation to the extent practicable

(4) As described below under “Post-Employment Compensation,” we traditionally maintained defined benefit and supplemental pension plans for our U.S. senior management (although future

Federal-Mogul German Pension Plan, as described under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Design and Elements of Compensation—Retirement Plans,” above. The changes in pension
values for Mr. Jueckstock from 2019 through 2021 were primarily due to changes in the discount rates used year-over-year to determine the present values of the benefits, including changes in
gains on such discount rates and changes in service costs, among other items. The discount rate for Mr. Jueckstock changed from 2.0% in 2018 to 1% in 2019, from 1% in 2019 to 1.25% in

As described in footnote 1 to the Summary Compensation Table, the PSUs granted for the 2020 through 2022 performance period did not have a grant date for accounting purposes in 2020 and,
because the performance goals for these awards were established in 2021 (on February 2 and May 13 for one-half of each award), are reported as 2021 compensation.
(5) Represents awards of restricted stock units under our 2021 LTIP. Half of the restricted stock units vest on May 14, 2022 and the remaining half of the restricted stock units vest on May 14,

Annual Bonus and Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards
For 2019, AIP metrics were to pay awards based on achievement of pre-established EBITDA objectives and pre-established cash flow
objectives, measured at business and division levels. For 2020, AIP metrics were to pay awards based 50% on pre-established EBITDA and
50% on pre-established cash flow objectives measured at the enterprise level. For 2021, AIP metrics were to pay awards based 50% on pre-
established EBITDA and 50% on pre-established cash flow objectives measured at the enterprise level. For 2021, the committee approved a
design change to the AIP such that overall company performance will be subject to an individual performance multiplier for each named
executive officer of 0% to 150%, based on the named executive officer’s performance as determined by the committee (with a named
executive officer’s payout remaining capped at 200% of his target payout except as otherwise determined by the committee). Among other
metrics that influence the individual performance multiplier, we included social metrics because we recognize that accountability for ensuring
a culture of inclusion, diversity and equity is paramount to overall business success. Understanding, measuring and rewarding the right
priorities will ensure we meet our goals and support the right culture for the future. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive
Summary—Changes in 2021 Program Design,” and “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Design and Elements of Compensation—
Salary and Annual Cash Incentive Compensation.” In general, a participant is entitled to a pro rata bonus if their employment is terminated
due to death, disability or retirement.
The amounts under the column entitled “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” in the Summary Compensation Table above are comprised
of (a) for all periods, the named executive officer’s payment under the AIP, (b) for 2019, the named executive officer’s long-term performance
share unit payments for the 2017 through 2019 performance period, and (c) for Mr. Jueckstock for 2019 and 2020, the FM LTIP payment for
the applicable performance period. See “— Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Design and Elements of Compensation — Salary and
Annual Cash Incentive Compensation.”
Stock Awards
Amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table under the column entitled “Stock Awards” represent (a) awards of restricted stock
units, (b) for 2019, the grant-date fair value of PSUs for the 2019 through 2021 performance period assuming achievement of targets at 100%
and (c) for 2021, the grant-date fair value of PSUs for both the 2020 through 2022 and 2021 through 2023 performance periods assuming
achievement of targets at 100%. Our restricted stock unit awards generally vest one-third per year during the three years after the grant date,
subject to the officer’s continued employment. Subject to the terms of any employment agreement, the unvested portion of these awards is
generally forfeited by a participant if their employment is terminated other than due to death, disability or retirement. All restrictions lapse
upon death, disability or retirement. Our PSUs are settled in class A common stock or cash at the end of the three-year performance period
on the basis of the achievement of the pre-established performance objectives. In the event of the executive’s death or disability prior to the
end of the performance period, a prorated portion of the target award will vest and be paid based on the portion of the performance period
elapsed prior to the executive’s termination of employment. In the event of the executive’s retirement prior to the end of the performance
period, the executive will be entitled to a prorated number of the units to which the executive would have been entitled based on performance
during the performance period had their employment not terminated based on the portion of the performance period elapsed prior to the
executive’s retirement. See “— Compensation Discussion and Analysis” for a discussion of specific determinations with respect to our PSUs.
Option Awards
Prior to 2015, we granted awards of nonqualified options to purchase common stock granted to our executive officers under our 2006 LTIP.
The awards vested one-third per year during the three years after the grant date, subject to the officer’s continued employment, and have a
seven-year term. Subject to the terms of any employment agreement, the unexercised portion of these awards is generally forfeited by a
participant on the date their employment is terminated
142Table of Contents
other than due to death, disability or retirement. In the event of death, disability or retirement, the options become fully exercisable and
remain exercisable for a period specified in the applicable award agreement.
Employment Agreements and Other Employment Arrangements
In December 2014, we provided Mr. Kesseler an offer letter that sets forth certain terms and conditions of his employment with our company.
The letter provides that, under our CIC Executive Severance Plan, Mr. Kesseler’s cash payment in connection with a change in control
termination would be equal to three times the total of his then current base salary plus targeted annual bonus in effect immediately prior to
the change in control. Pursuant to the letter, we paid Mr. Kesseler a one-time signing bonus of $1,000,000 and an award of 83,474 restricted
shares that vested 50% on each of the second and fourth anniversaries of the grant date to replace equity forfeited when he left his prior
position. In addition, Mr. Kesseler received full LTPU grants for the 2013 through 2015 and 2014 through 2016 performance periods to replace
foregone benefits. Pursuant to the letter, Mr. Kesseler is eligible to participate in the benefit plans we offer to our employees generally as well
as our long-term incentive plan. Mr. Kesseler’s offer letter was amended when he became our Co-Chief Executive Officer on October 1, 2018
to provide that, other than in connection with a change in control, if Mr. Kesseler’s employment is terminated by us other than for disability or
for cause, he will be paid two times his then current annual base salary and target bonus for the year in which termination occurs.
In October 2018, we provided Mr. Jueckstock an offer letter that sets forth certain terms and conditions of his employment with our company.
The letter provides that Mr. Jueckstock is eligible to participate in our CIC Executive Severance Plan. The agreement also provides that, if Mr.
Jueckstock’s employment is terminated, he will be eligible to participate in our Severance Benefit Plan. Pursuant to the letter, Mr. Jueckstock
is eligible to participate in the benefit plans we offer to our employees generally as well as our long-term incentive plan.
In October 2018, we provided Mr. Norton an offer letter that sets forth certain terms and conditions of his employment with our company. The
letter provides that Mr. Norton is eligible to participate in our CIC Executive Severance Plan. The agreement also provides that, if Mr. Norton’s
employment is terminated, he will be eligible to participate in our Severance Benefit Plan. Pursuant to the letter, Mr. Norton is eligible to
participate in the benefit plans we offer to our employees generally as well as our long-term incentive plan. Mr. Norton transitioned to a new
position in May 2021 when he became our Executive Vice President, Business Operations Excellence and received a letter that sets forth
certain terms and conditions of his employment with our company, which terms and conditions are consistent with Mr. Norton’s 2018 offer
letter.
In July 2020, we provided Mr. Baird an offer letter that sets forth certain terms and conditions of his employment with our company. The letter
provides that Mr. Baird is eligible to participate in our CIC Executive Severance Plan. The agreement also provides that, if Mr. Baird’s
employment is terminated, he would be eligible to participate in our Severance Benefit Plan. Pursuant to the letter, we paid Mr. Baird a one-
time signing bonus of $600,000 with the full amount to be paid on or as soon as practicable after February 28, 2021 but in no event later than
March 15, 2021, subject to his continued employment. Additionally, we paid Mr. Baird an award of restricted stock units with a value of
$1,000,000, with one-half of the award vesting on August 3, 2021 and the remaining one-half of the award vesting on August 3, 2022, and an
award of restricted stock units with a value of $800,000, which will vest ratably over three years from the date of grant. Pursuant to the letter,
Mr. Baird is eligible to participate in the benefit plans we offer to our employees generally as well as our long-term incentive plan.
In July 2020, we provided Mr. Masanovich an offer letter that sets forth certain terms and conditions of his employment with our company. The
letter provides that Mr. Masanovich is eligible to participate in our CIC Executive Severance Plan. The agreement also provides that, if Mr.
Masanovich’s employment is terminated, he would be eligible to participate in our Severance Benefit Plan. Pursuant to the letter, we paid Mr.
Masanovich a one-time signing bonus of $220,000 with the full amount to be paid on or as soon as practicable after February 28, 2021 but in
no event later than March 15, 2021, subject to his continued employment. Additionally, we paid Mr. Masanovich an award of restricted stock
units with a value of $1,100,000, with 27% of the award vesting on August 10, 2021, 27% of the award vesting on August 10, 2022 and the

2006 Changes in Defined Benefit Plans
Benefits under Tenneco’s U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans were generally frozen for salaried employees effective as of
December 31, 2006. Prior earned benefits under the defined benefit plans were, however, preserved. This freeze generally impacted all U.S.-
based salaried employees and non-union hourly employees who participated in any of the plans.
To mitigate the loss of benefits associated with the defined benefit plan freeze, we amended our existing qualified defined contribution plans,
effective January 1, 2007, to provide for Company Retirement Contributions. Initially, the amount of the contribution was a fixed contribution of
2% of compensation with some participants being subject to an age-based formula. Beginning in 2020, the percentage for all Company
Retirement Contributions was determined under an age-based formula (between 2.5% and 4% of compensation). In addition, effective January
1, 2007, we implemented an unfunded non-qualified defined contribution plan as described in “— Compensation Discussion and Analysis —
Design and Elements of Compensation — Retirement Plans.”

named executive officers and other senior managers are eligible to participate in an Excess Benefit Plan, with allocations under the plan
calculated in the same manner as under the applicable corresponding tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan, except that (i)
Company Retirement Contributions under the Excess Benefit Plan are made based on compensation that includes bonus compensation
payable in accordance with the AIP formula, (ii) contributions under the Excess Benefit Plan are based on compensation in excess of the
Section 401(a)(17) limitations of the Internal Revenue Code and (iii) prior to 2021, our Chief Executive Officer had special benefits under the

The following describes potential post-employment compensation for each of our named executive officers.
Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives
We maintain a CIC Executive Severance Plan. The purpose of the plan is to enable us to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly
qualified employees by eliminating, to the maximum practicable extent, any concern on the part of such employees that their job security or
benefit entitlements will be jeopardized by a “change in control” of our company. The plan was amended and restated effective as of November
5, 2020 to conform certain provisions of the plan to our long-term incentive plan, to eliminate references to tax gross-ups which do not apply
to any of our employees and to make other technical and conforming changes.
Under the plan, as amended, a “change in control” happens if:
·
any person or group acquires (A) 30% or more of the voting power of our then-outstanding securities having general voting rights or (B)
40% or more of our outstanding shares of class A common stock and class B common stock in the aggregate subject to limited
exceptions;
·
our incumbent directors cease to constitute a majority of our Board;
·
there is a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all the assets in which our stockholders own less than 50% of the new
company; or
·
we are liquidated or dissolved.
Benefits under the plan are payable to a key employee whose employment is terminated (either actually or constructively) on or within two
years after a change in control. Under the plan, we must pay an eligible executive a lump sum cash payment equal to one, two or three
times, depending on their grouping under the plan, (i) their base salary and (ii) their targeted annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the
change in control. In addition, we must provide the executive with (a) a pro rata bonus at target (payable in a lump sum), (b) one, two or three
years (depending on their grouping under the plan) of health and welfare benefits continuation, (c) out placement services and (d) all deferred
compensation (payable in a lump sum, subject to applicable plan provisions and applicable tax rules). Awards under our 2006 LTIP are
subject to the terms of the 2006 LTIP while awards under our 2021 LTIP are subject to the terms of the 2021 LTIP (or successor). Gross-up
payments were completely eliminated with the November 5, 2020 amendments to the long-term incentive plan and none of the named
executive officers were entitled to gross-up payments prior to the amendment.
Under our 2006 LTIP for grants made prior to November 5, 2020, upon a change in control, all options and stock appreciation rights will
immediately vest and remain exercisable for up to 36 months and all restrictions on outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units
will lapse and our LTPUs and PSUs shall be deemed fully earned on the date of the change in control and paid based on assumed
achievement of targeted performance goals. Under our 2006 LTIP for grants made on or after November 5, 2020 or under our 2021 LTIP, unless
the committee determines that performance conditions can be determined on substantially the same basis as prior to the change in control,
any performance conditions applicable to outstanding performance awards or cash incentive awards will be deemed to have been achieved at
the target level of performance for the performance period in effect on the date of the change in control and any service-based conditions
applicable to such awards will continue to apply as if the change in control had not occurred. If a participant’s employment or service
terminates on or within 24 months following the change in control due to termination for cause or good reason (each as defined in its
respective long-term incentive plan) all then outstanding awards will vest upon the termination and any options or stock appreciation rights will
remain exercisable for 24 months following the termination. In the event that awards granted on or after November 5, 2020 are not continued,
assumed or replaced in connection with the change in control, the outstanding awards will become fully vested upon the change in control
(with performance being determined at target in the case of performance awards) and will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment or
other consideration generally provided to stockholders in the change in control.

Messrs. Kesseler, Masanovich, Baird, Jueckstock, and Norton would have become entitled to receive payments from us as follows had we
experienced a change in control on December 31, 2021 (assuming termination on that date, including, to the extent applicable, with respect
to LTPUs, options, PSUs, restricted stock and restricted stock units, as described above).

(3) Executives are not entitled to any excise tax gross up or reimbursement by the company.
(4) The amounts presented are estimated without any allocation of amounts payable to service prior to or after the change in control.
Severance Benefits
If Mr. Kesseler was involuntarily terminated by us other than for disability or cause or in connection with a change in control, he would have
been entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to two times his respective annual base salary and two times his targeted annual bonus
(which lump sum amount would have been $6,000,000 for Mr. Kesseler as of December 31, 2021).
We maintain a Severance Benefit Plan that applies to all U.S. salaried, full-time employees (including officers) with at least three months of
service and who are not eligible for any type of severance or termination benefit with respect to a termination otherwise covered by the
Severance Benefit Plan or who are otherwise covered by any other severance plan or agreement. The Severance Benefit Plan was most
recently amended as of April 1, 2020 to add additional requirements relating to the receipt of severance benefits, to change the severance
payment period (from a lump sum to installments) and to make technical and conforming changes. The Severance Benefit Plan provides
benefits for eligible employees whose termination of employment occurs as a result of a “Covered Termination” (which generally means a
termination by the company without cause (as defined in the plan) or termination by the employee due to constructive discharge (also as
defined in the plan)). Under this plan, eligible employees who are officers and whose employment is terminated by the company without
cause or due to a constructive discharge will be entitled to receive a severance payment equal to (1) one year of base salary plus target
bonus and (2) a medical subsidy payment which is 52 times (or such lower number of weeks included in the severance payment) (a) the
employer-paid portion of the monthly premium for medical coverage for the employee under the company’s medical plans (determined as of
the termination date) divided by (b) four. Outplacement services are also provided. Severance payments under the Severance Benefit Plan are
paid in substantially equal installments over the severance period and all payments (and other benefits) are discontinued if the individual
obtains alternative employment (determined in accordance with the terms of the plan) after termination of employment with the company. The
Severance Benefit Plan would apply to Messrs. Masanovich, Baird, Jueckstock, and Norton, each of whom we expect would have received
cash payments of $1,520,491, $1,801,141, $5,203,145, and $1,334,875, respectively, if his employment had been terminated by us on
December 31, 2021 under circumstances not covered by another severance plan or arrangement (in addition to outplacement services) and
assuming that no alternative employment was obtained after termination with the company. We require participants to sign a customary
release to receive benefits under this plan.

TENNECO INC_20220426_DEFM14A_20034100_4448087.Pdf,Compensation-Related Risk,"COMPENSATION-RELATED RISK
We believe that our compensation programs for our named executive officers and other employees incentivize the creation of stockholder
value on both an annual and long-term basis. As a result, we believe our programs do not encourage excessive or inappropriate risk-taking
and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.
Our annual cash incentives for most salaried and some hourly employees are based primarily on the achievement of Enterprise EBITDA and
Enterprise FCF performance, which we believe are key drivers of stockholder value. Each individual incentive target is not excessive in relation
to the participant’s base salary. Subject to the discretion of the committee, these annual cash incentives are capped at 200% of target.
150Table of Contents
Payouts under our long-term incentive awards are also capped at 200% of target. They are based on (a) for 2019, total stockholder return
measures and Division FCF performance, (b) for 2020, Enterprise EBITDA and Enterprise FCF performance, and (c) for 2021, Enterprise
EBITDA and Enterprise Net Leverage Ratio. We believe that these measures are key indicators of the value generated for stockholders. We
attempt to set ranges for these measures that encourage success without encouraging excessive risk taking to achieve results.
We award restricted stock and restricted stock units to our senior and middle managers to further align the interests of our employees and
stockholders. These awards typically vest over a three-year period. We believe our long-term compensation programs encourage the delivery
of sustained performance over multiple periods, rather than performance in a single period.",158,159

(1) The Median Employee is paid in Poland zloty. Compensation has been converted to U.S. Dollars based on an average exchange rate from Poland zloty to U.S. Dollar of 3.96/1.
Employees Covered
The median employee was identified based on full- and part-time employees active at our company worldwide on October 31, 2021 based on
compensation paid for the period from November 1, 2020 through October 31, 2021. Seasonal employees who were not active employees on
October 31, 2021, and individuals employed by third parties who work at our facilities were not included.
Methodology Employed to Determine the Median Employee
For 2021, we identified a new median employee by examining the total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding the Chief Executive
Officer, employed by us on October 31, 2021. Total cash compensation includes annual wages, overtime pay, variable pay bonuses, shift
differentials, additional months’ pay (for individuals in some non-U.S. countries as required by law), pay for bereavement leave, military leave,
jury duty, maternity/paternity leave and payments for unused vacation time in countries or U.S. states where applicable. For any employee
(except temporary employees and interns) hired during the period from November 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021 who was an active employee
on October 31, 2021, the annual compensation of such individual was annualized. No cost of living adjustment was taken in determining the
median employee.

*Ms. Kumbier became a director on August 10, 2021.
Fee Structure
In establishing outside director compensation, each year the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews a market analysis prepared by
Meridian that reviews our outside directors’ compensation in relation to outside director compensation at the same peer group companies
used for purposes of executive compensation benchmarking. The analysis reviews retainers, meeting fees, committee fees, equity award and
total compensation, and also covers stock ownership guidelines, the prevalence of equity grants and leadership additional compensation.
Tenneco’s outside director compensation is at the median of the peer group companies. For 2021, each outside director was paid an annual
cash retainer fee of $120,000 for service on the Board, each committee chair received an additional $20,000 fee, and directors serving on two
or more committees received an additional $10,000 fee. An additional fee of $200,000 per year is paid to the non-executive Chairman. The
outside directors also received reimbursement of their expenses for attending meetings of the Board and its committees. The fees are
generally paid in cash but, at the option of the director may be deferred as described below.
Stock Grants
In 2021, each outside director received a stock grant award with a target value of $120,000, except for Ms. Kumbier, who received a stock
grant award with a target value of $47,342, which represented the pro-rata amount of time she served as an outside director.
Deferred Compensation Plan
We have a voluntary deferred compensation plan for outside directors. Under the plan, an outside director may elect, prior to commencement
of the next calendar year, to have some or all of their cash retainer fee and some or all of their meeting or other fees credited to a deferred
compensation account. The plan provides these directors with various investment options. Final distribution of these amounts may be made
either in a lump sum or in installments over a period of years. The common stock equivalents are issued at 100% of the fair market value on
the date of the grant.

•
Professional services in connection with procedures related to various other accounting consultations and attestation reports.
(c) Tax services in 2021 and 2020 consisted primarily of tax compliance (e.g., tax return preparation) and other tax advice on transactions
that have already occurred to document, compute, support and obtain government approval for amounts to be included in tax filings.
(d) “All Other Fees” consist principally of software license fees related to accounting research tools.
In considering the nature of the services provided by PwC for 2021 and 2020, the Audit Committee determined that such services were
compatible with the provision of independent audit services. The Audit Committee discussed these

independence promulgated by the SEC to implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants.",164,165
TENNECO INC_20220426_DEFM14A_20034100_4448087.Pdf,Pre-Approval Policy,"Pre-Approval Policy
The Audit Committee maintains a pre-approval policy regarding the provision of non-audit services by our independent public accounting firm.
All of the services performed by PwC in 2021 were pre-approved in accordance with the pre-approval policy adopted by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee’s pre-approval policy describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services (collectively, the “Disclosure
Categories”) that our independent auditor may perform. The policy requires that, each fiscal year, a description of the services (the “Service
List”) expected to be performed by our independent auditor in each of the Disclosure Categories, as well as related budgeted fee amounts, be
presented to the Audit Committee for approval. Providing a range of fees for a service incorporates appropriate oversight and control of the
independent auditor relationship while permitting us to receive immediate assistance from the independent auditor when time is of the
essence.
Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services not included on the Service List must be submitted to the Audit Committee for
specific pre-approval and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled
meetings. However, the authority to grant specific pre-approval between meetings, as necessary, has been delegated to the Chair of the Audit
Committee. The Chair must update the Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting of any services that were granted specific
pre-approval. The Audit Committee will monitor the Service List as necessary, but no less than on a quarterly basis. Any proposed service
exceeding 110% of the pre-approved cost level or budgeted amount requires specific additional pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

an Advisory Vote (Item 6)","Approve Executive Compensation In An Advisory
Vote (Item 6)
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named
executive officers.
In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), (which was
added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)), and the related rules of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we are asking our stockholders to cast an advisory, non-binding vote on the compensation
of our named executive officers. This proposal, commonly referred to as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to
endorse, not endorse or abstain from voting on our executive compensation programs and policies. This vote is not intended to address any
specific item of compensation but, rather, the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the compensation principles, policies
and practices described in this proxy statement. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that we submit a proposal to stockholders similar to this
proposal at least every three years.
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain officers of the highest qualifications, experience and ability and to
motivate them to increase stockholder value on both an annual and a longer-term basis primarily by improving EBITDA and cash flow. The
Compensation Committee, to which we refer as the “committee,” believes that our executive compensation program reflects a strong pay-for-
performance philosophy and drives the alignment of stockholder and management interests. The key features of our executive compensation
program include:
·
Compensation for our executives is weighted primarily toward incentive forms of compensation, including annual cash incentive
compensation and equity compensation. This reinforces a results-oriented management culture with the overarching goal of enhancing
stockholder value.
·
Our general policy has been to provide salary, annual cash incentive payments and long-term incentive compensation to executives
based on performance that is competitive and at market levels with comparable companies when financial and qualitative targets are
met.
·
We maintain stock ownership guidelines that apply to all of our directors and our senior officers. As of April 20, 2022, our current
executive officers collectively beneficially owned approximately 1.8% of our outstanding common stock, which significantly aligns their
interests with the interests of our stockholders.
·
Our committee has directly retained and receives advice from Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC, an independent compensation
consulting firm that provides no other services to our company.
As noted in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis of this proxy statement, we believe our compensation program for our named
executive officers has been effective in driving our financial results in 2021.
Accordingly, we are submitting the following resolution for stockholder vote at the Annual Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Tenneco approve, on an advisory basis, the 2021 compensation of Tenneco’s named executive
officers as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for the 2022 Annual Meeting under the heading “Executive Compensation,” including the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table, and the other tables and narrative disclosures set forth
thereunder.”
This vote is an advisory vote, and therefore the result will not be binding on us. Although the vote is non-binding, the committee, which is
comprised of independent directors and is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the
opinions expressed by stockholders. Accordingly, the committee will review the results of voting on this proposal, seek to determine the
cause or causes of any significant negative voting results and will take these matters into consideration when making future compensation
decisions for named executive officers.

in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2023, the proposal must be received by
November 28, 2022.
In addition, the proxy access By-Law provision adopted by the Board allows qualifying stockholders to include their director nominees in the
company’s proxy materials under certain circumstances by giving adequate and timely notice to the Corporate Secretary. A stockholder or
group of no more than 20 stockholders (meeting our continuous ownership requirement of 3% or more of our outstanding class A common
stock held continuously for at least the previous three years) can nominate a candidate or candidates for election to the Board at an annual
meeting of stockholders, constituting up to two directors or 20% of the number of directors then serving on the Board (rounded down to the
nearest whole number), whichever is greater, provided that the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-
Laws. In order for such nominees to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy, stockholders and nominees must submit a notice
of proxy access nomination together with certain related information required by our By-Laws. Our By-Laws state that, to be timely, the notice
and certain related information must be delivered to our principal executive offices not earlier than the close of business on the 150th day nor
later than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the date that the company’s proxy statement was first

With respect to stockholder proposals not included in the company’s proxy statement and form of proxy, the notice requirement and deadline
are independent of the notice requirement and deadline described above for a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy

later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the

The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders provided the procedures set
forth below are followed by stockholders in submitting recommendations. The committee does not intend to alter the manner in which it
evaluates candidates, including the minimum criteria set forth elsewhere in this proxy statement, based on whether the candidate was
recommended by a stockholder. Separate from our proxy access By-law, a stockholder of our company may nominate persons for election to
the Board at an annual meeting of stockholders if the stockholder submits such nomination, together with certain related information required
by our By-Laws, in writing to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices within the time period described in the prior paragraph.
Following verification of the stockholder’s status, the Nominating and Governance Committee will perform an initial analysis of the
qualifications of the nominee pursuant to the criteria listed in this proxy statement to determine whether the nominee is qualified for service on
our Board before deciding to undertake a complete evaluation of the nominee. Other than the verification of compliance with the procedures

notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), the Closing shall instead take place on the earlier of (i) a Business Day during the
Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Company and (ii) the third
Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period (subject, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), to the satisfaction or, to the

actually occurs is referred to as the “Closing Date”. On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree
to, Merger Sub or the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”), to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate
of Merger (such date and time at which the Merger becomes effective hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”).
ARTICLE 2
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER
2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:
(a) Conversion of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled
or converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $20.00 per
Share (the “Merger Consideration”), payable to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2. As
of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.2.
(b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by
Parent or Merger Sub (or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Merger Sub), in each case, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange
therefor or in respect thereof. All Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger
Sub) will automatically be converted into such number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, no par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation, or fraction thereof, such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Merger Sub Equity Interests. All outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub held immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become (in the aggregate) one hundred (100) shares of newly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.
(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a nationally recognized bank or trust company to act as the
paying agent (the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) for
purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger in accordance with this Article 2 (the
“Paying Agent”). The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement. In the event such deposited funds are insufficient to make the
payments contemplated pursuant to Section 2.1, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such
additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds to make such payments. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares in accordance with this Article
2; provided, however, that any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively. Earnings from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders
of Shares.
(b) Procedures for Surrender.
(i) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective
Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
a holder of record of Shares represented by certificates (the “Certificates”), which Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(e)) in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.2(e)) to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed
and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the Paying Agent or such other agent, in accordance with the letter of transmittal
and instructions, shall transmit to the holder of such Certificates the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificates (subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5), and any Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and
A-5
Table of Contents
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent or the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent only the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and solely to the extent provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL.
(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall be required to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry
Shares held through The Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more
Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such
Book-Entry Share a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5), and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall be cancelled. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry
Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in such form as Parent and the Paying
Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
delivery of such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger
Consideration (subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5), and such Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall at the Effective Time be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to
represent the right to receive
A-6
Table of Contents
payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and solely to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.
(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.
(d) Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. Any portion of the funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) made available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2(b) prior to such time shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5, in respect of such holder’s surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b). Any portion of the Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(a), to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand.
(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof,
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to the provisions of this Section 2.3),
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, the
“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting
Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them
under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of
the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in
Section 2.5. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.
2.4 Treatment of Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units .
(a) Treatment of Cash-Settled Performance Share Units. At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company cash-settled
performance share units (each a, “Cash-Settled PSU”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become fully vested
and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding
Taxes) equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares or Share equivalents underlying such award of Cash-Settled PSUs (based
on all applicable performance criteria being achieved at target performance), multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.
(b) Treatment of Cash-Settled Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company cash-settled
restricted stock units (each a, “Cash-Settled RSU”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become fully vested and be
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes)
equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares underlying such award of Cash-Settled RSUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration.
(c) Treatment of Share-Settled Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units
A-8
Table of Contents
. At the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding award of Share-settled Company restricted stock units (each, a “Share-Settled RSUs”) that
at such time is subject solely to service-based vesting conditions shall become fully vested and shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without
interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares underlying such award of Share-Settled RSUs,
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and (ii) each outstanding award of Company share-settled performance share units (“Share-
Settled PSUs”, and together with the Cash-Settled RSUs, Cash-Settled PSUs and Share-Settled RSUs, “Company Awards”) that at
such time is subject to performance-based vesting conditions that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
vested as to the number of Shares subject to such award that would vest at the target level, and shall, after giving effect to such vesting,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the
right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of vested Shares underlying such award,
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.
(d) Payment by Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the
holders of Company Awards the amounts described in Sections 2.4(a), 2.4(b) and 2.4(c), less any Taxes required to be withheld under
applicable Law with respect to such payments and subject to any deferral elections with respect to such Company Awards made by the
holders of such Company Awards pursuant to the Tenneco Inc. Incentive Deferral Plan, as amended and restated effective as of January
1, 2018, as applicable, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system, but not
later than five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any amounts payable
under this Section 2.4 relate to a Company Award that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the applicable Subsidiary shall pay such amounts as promptly as is practicable following the earliest
time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Company Award and that will not
trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code (after taking into account actions taken under Treasury Regulations Section 1-
409A-3(j)(4)(ix)), but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after such time.
(e) Termination of the Company Equity Plans. As of the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plans shall be terminated and no further
Shares or Company Awards in the Company or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder. Following the Effective
Time, no such Company Award or other right that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and
each former holder of any such Company Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
consideration set forth in this Section 2.4.
(f) Board Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take such other actions as are reasonably necessary to effect the transactions described in this Section 2.4.

2.5 Withholding Rights. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of applicable Law. In the
event any such Person (a “Payor”) determines that any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (other than any amounts
payable in respect of compensation for services) would be subject to deduction or withholding under applicable Law, (a) Payor shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Person otherwise entitled to such amounts (a “Payee”) prior to the date on which such
deduction or withholding is anticipated to occur, and (b) the Payor and the Payee shall reasonably cooperate to minimize or eliminate
such deduction or withholding as permitted by applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.
2.6 Adjustments. In the event that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares
shall occur as a result of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of Equity Interests
convertible into or exchangeable for Shares), recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar event, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such event and to provide to holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided that nothing in this Section 2.6 shall be deemed to permit or authorize the
Company to take any such action or effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to take pursuant to Section
5.1 or is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

A-33
Table of Contents
the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to Parent the amount of debt financing set forth therein (the “Debt Financing” and,
together with the Equity Financing, the “Financing”), in each case, solely for the Financing Purposes. A true and complete copy of each
Commitment Letter (other than the fee letter referred to in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, which is addressed below) has been
previously provided to the Company. All fees (if any) required to be paid under the Commitment Letters on or prior to the date hereof
have been paid in full. As of the date hereof, each Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, in accordance with its terms. As of the date hereof, none of the

under the terms of this Agreement, the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions is not in any way
contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parent’s or Merger Sub’s consummation of any financing arrangements, Parent or Merger
obtaining of any financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Parent or Merger Sub. Except for the fee
letter referred to in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter (a true and complete copy of which fee letter has been provided to the
Company, with only fee amounts, “market flex” provisions, “securities demand” provisions, pricing terms, pricing caps and other
commercially sensitive terms redacted (none of which could adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or termination
of the Financing or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing below the amount required to pay the Financing Purposes
of the Financing or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing below the amount required to pay the Financing Purposes
and to the extent that any such redacted term shall be modified in such a way to impact the conditionality of the Financing or reduce the
aggregate principal amount of the Financing below the amount required to pay the Financing Purposes, then such modified term shall be
disclosed to the Company)) and customary engagement letters and fee credit letters related to the Debt Financing (which engagement
letters and fee credit letters do not relate to any terms that may adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or
termination of the Financing or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing below the amount required to pay the Financing
Purposes), as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements or contracts or arrangements related to the funding or
investing, as

the Debt Financing Commitment Letter nor any other Contract between the Guarantors or the Debt Financing Sources, on the one
hand, and Parent or any of its affiliates, on the other hand, contains any conditions precedent or other contingencies (other than as set
forth in the applicable Commitment Letters) (x) related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or any provisions that could
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in any Commitment Letter, in each case, below the amount required to pay the
Financing Purposes or (y) that could otherwise adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability or availability of any Commitment Letter
with respect to all or any portion of the Financing required to pay the Financing Purposes. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub (x) is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters and, to the Knowledge of the Parent,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Commitment Letters or (y) has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing would not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing would not be available to Parent on the Closing Date in at least
the amount required to pay the Financing Purposes.
(b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Guarantors have delivered to the Company the duly executed Guaranty. The
Guaranty is in full force and effect, has not been amended or modified, and is a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the

participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries

qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation, in each
case, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub in any material respect (it being understood that it shall be considered a modification
adverse to Parent and Merger Sub that is material if any Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer is commenced

recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or propose to adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable) an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (iv) within five (5) Business Days

A-44
Table of Contents
contemplated by Section 5.3(d) nor any determination by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) contemplated by Section 5.3(d)
in connection with such notice will, in and of itself, constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change.
(d) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval:
(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to any material
event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that (A) was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board as
of the date hereof; and (B) does not involve or relate to the receipt, existence or terms of any Acquisition Proposal (or any proposal or
inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal) (each such event, an “Intervening Event”), if the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law and if and
only if:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three (3) Business Days (the “Event Notice Period”)
in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i) which notice will specify the basis for such Company Board
Recommendation Change, including a description of the Intervening Event in reasonable detail;
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives, during such
Event Notice Period, must have (A) negotiated with Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives in good faith (to the
extent that Parent and Merger Sub desire to so negotiate) to allow Parent and Merger Sub to offer such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and/or the Guaranty to obviate the need to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change, in response to such Intervening Event; and (B) taken into account any
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and/or the Guaranty proposed by

p.m. (Central Time) on the last day of the Event Notice Period, in a manner that would constitute a binding agreement
between the parties if accepted by the Company; and
(3) following such Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s and Merger Sub’s proposed revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement) shall have determined that the failure of the
A-45
Table of Contents
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make such a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; provided that each time material
modifications to the Intervening Event occur, the Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the time period set
forth in the preceding clause (2) shall recommence and be extended for three (3) Business Days from the day of such
notification.

terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) shall not take any action described in the foregoing clauses (x) or (y) unless:
(1) the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives have complied in all material respects with
their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
(2) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the
“Proposal Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a bona fide

agrees to use reasonable best efforts to review all Offering Documents and marketing materials for the Debt Financing (subject to Parent
providing the Company with reasonable time to review) and identify for Parent any information contained therein that it reasonably
believes constitutes material non-public information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or their
respective securities. If the Company identifies any such information, then the Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K
containing such material non-public information.
5.6 Financing Obligation of Parent.
(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Debt Financing in an amount required to satisfy the Financing Purposes not later than the
Closing Date (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Financing

set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter), including by using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
and the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing
required to pay the Financing Purposes (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) (which, with respect to the bridge

reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing required to satisfy the Financing Purposes (after taking into
account any available Equity Financing)) on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (or on other
terms that would not (A) reasonably be expected to adversely affect Parent’s ability to consummate the Transactions, (B) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount necessary to satisfy the Financing Purposes (after taking into account any
available Equity Financing), (C) impose new or additional conditions or expand upon (or amend or modify in any manner adverse to the
interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries) the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters in a manner that would be reasonably expected to delay the Closing or make the Closing less likely to occur or (D)
reasonably be expected to delay the availability of the Debt Financing required to satisfy the Financing Purposes (after taking into
account any available Equity Financing) beyond the date that the Closing is required to be effected in accordance with Section 1.2), (iii)
satisfy or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain a waiver thereof, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent contained in the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters to the funding of the Debt Financing required to satisfy the Financing Purposes (after taking into
account any available Equity Financing) that are within its control to be satisfied by Parent (other than any condition where the failure to
be so satisfied is primarily the result of the Company’s failure to provide the cooperation described in Section 5.5), including the
payment of any commitment, engagement, or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing, (iv) assuming that all
conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter have been satisfied, consummate the Debt Financing in an amount
required to satisfy the Financing Purposes at or prior to the Closing Date, and (v) comply with its obligations under the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters. Subject to the terms and upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such Debt Financing to provide the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date and shall fully enforce the counterparties’ obligations and its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment
Letters to cause the lenders under the Debt Financing to fund in accordance with their respective commitments. Parent shall provide to
the Company copies of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters and any amendments thereto within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of
the final executed copy of such amendment and shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail
of material developments in respect of the financing process relating thereto. In the event that Parent seeks to enforce its rights under the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements entered into in connection therewith and/or cause the financing sources
to fund the Debt Financing (any such action, a “Financing Action”), Parent shall (x) keep the Company reasonably informed of the status
of the Financing Action and (y) at the reasonable request of the Company, shall make Parent’s employees and Representatives available
to discuss the status of, and developments with respect to, the Financing Action.
(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice (i) of any breach or
default by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing of
A-55
Table of Contents
which Parent becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other written communication, in each case from any
Debt Financing Source with respect to any (I) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing of any provision of the Debt Financing Commitment
Letters or the definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing, (II) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to
the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the
Debt Financing in the amount of the Debt Financing required to satisfy the Financing Purposes (after taking into account any available
Equity Financing) at Closing, and (iii) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Debt Financing necessary to satisfy the Financing Purposes (after taking into account any available Equity Financing). As
soon as reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence.
(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to, or permit, any amendment or
modification of, or waiver or consent under, any Commitment Letter or other documentation relating to the Financing which would (i)
reasonably be expected to adversely affect Parent’s ability to consummate the Transactions, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing below the amount necessary to satisfy the Financing Purposes (after taking into account any available Equity Financing), (iii)
impose new or additional conditions or expand upon (or amend or modify in any manner adverse to the interests of the Company or its
Subsidiaries) the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letters in a manner that would be reasonably
expected to delay the Closing or make the Closing less likely to occur, or (iv) reasonably be expected to delay the availability of the
Financing required to satisfy the Financing Purposes; provided that, the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or such documentation may
be amended to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other entities who had not executed the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. For purposes of Section 5.5 (Parent Financing Assistance), Section 5.6
(Financing Obligation of Parent), Section 9.7(Amendment and Waiver), Section 9.9 (Third Party Beneficiaries), Section 9.10
(Waiver of Trial by Jury), Section 9.14 (Governing Law), and Section 9.15 (Consent to Jurisdiction), the definitions of “Debt
Financing Commitment Letter” and “Debt Financing” shall include the Debt Financing or the Replacement Debt Financing, as applicable,
or documents related thereto as permitted to be amended or modified by this Section 5.6. Upon any amendment or modification of the
Commitment Letters in accordance with this Section 5.6(c), Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment or modification.
(d) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.6, the Debt Financing or
the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (or any definitive financing agreement relating thereto) expire or are terminated or become
unavailable prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason, and such portion is required to satisfy the Financing Purposes (after
taking into account any available Equity Financing), Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such expiration, termination, or
A-56
Table of Contents
unavailability and the reasons therefor and (ii) subject to the third to last sentence of this Section 5.6(d), use its reasonable best efforts
promptly to arrange for a firm commitment for alternative financing (“Replacement Debt Financing”) (which, shall not, without the prior
consent of the Company, (A) impose any new or additional condition or otherwise expand any condition to the receipt of the Debt
Financing that makes the funding of the Debt Financing in an amount required to satisfy the Financing Purposes (after taking into account
any available Equity Financing) less likely to occur or (B) otherwise be on terms and conditions that are materially less favorable to
Parent from a conditionality or enforceability perspective than the terms and conditions of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters) to
replace the financing contemplated by such expired, terminated, or unavailable commitment or arrangement or any portion thereof in an
amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Debt Financing that remains available and taking into account any available Equity
Financing, to satisfy the Financing Purposes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this Section 5.6 shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to
pay any fees or any interest rates applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter (including the market flex provisions) or agree to any other term materially less favorable to Parent or the Company than such
corresponding term contained in or contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter (in either case, whether to secure waiver of
any conditions contained therein or otherwise). Copies of any new financing commitment letter, including any term sheet, annex and any
agreements related thereto entered into in connection with any Replacement Debt Financing (including any related fee letter (with fee
amount redacted to the extent required by the applicable financing source)) shall be promptly provided to the Company and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt by Parent of a final executed copy of such new financing commitment letter. In such event, (1) the
term “Debt Financing” will be deemed to include any Replacement Debt Financing and (2) the term “Debt Financing Commitment
Letter” will be deemed to include any commitment letters with respect to such Replacement Debt Financing.

advance from the source of the materials.
(b) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Order, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions, (ii)
promptly inform the other parties hereto of (and, if in writing, supply to the other parties’ legal counsel) any material communication,

contemplated hereby. Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party relating to proceedings under the HSR Act, any Antitrust Law or with respect to any FDI Approval. Notwithstanding the forgoing
and anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parent shall control and lead (with prior notice to and consultation of the
Company, and taking the Company’s views into account in good faith) all communications and strategy relating to any process under the
HSR Act, any Antitrust Law and with respect to any FDI Approval.
(c) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable Governmental Entity, each of the Company, on one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (i) to the extent reasonably practicable and permissible by the relevant Governmental
Entity, not participate in or attend any material meeting, or engage in any material conversation (other than ministerial conversations) with
any Governmental Entity in respect of the Transactions without the other, (ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, give the other
reasonable prior notice of any such material meeting or material conversation and (iii) in the event one such party is prohibited by
applicable Law or Order or by the applicable Governmental Entity from participating or attending any such material meeting or engaging
in any such material conversation, or it has not been reasonably practicable to include the non-participating party, keep such non-
participating party reasonably apprised with respect thereto.
(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the actions and obligations described in Section 5.7(b) and Section 5.7(c), Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly (and in any event, prior to the Outside Date) resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, any Antitrust Law or with
respect to any FDI Approval. In connection therewith, if any Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted), which Proceeding
challenges any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, or threatens to
result in the denial of any FDI Approval, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly contest and resist any such Proceeding,
and seek to have promptly vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, limits or restricts the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be required to cause the expiration or termination of the waiting, notice or review
periods under the HSR Act, any Antitrust Law or with respect to any FDI Approval, in each case, with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement (and in any event prior to the Outside Date). Parent shall not more than one
(1) time, without prior written consent of the Company, and taking the Company’s views into account in good faith, “pull-and-refile,”
pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12, any filing made under the HSR Act or take any similar action under the Antitrust Laws, or with respect to
any FDI Approval, set forth on Section 5.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case, with respect to any filing
A-59
Table of Contents
made with any Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent or any of its affiliates shall not
be required by this Agreement to make any notification to any Governmental Entity where not otherwise required by Law regarding any
proposed transaction (other than the Transactions).
(e) Parent further agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, to the extent necessary to obtain any waiver, permit, approval,
clearance or consent from any Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Law or any FDI Approval or which is
otherwise required to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c), as applicable, or to avoid the entry of or have
lifted, vacated, reversed or terminated any Closing Legal Impediment, in each case, prior to the Outside Date, promptly take the
following actions: (i) propose, negotiate and offer to commit and to effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, transfer, license or other disposition (including by licensing any
Intellectual Property) of any assets or businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) propose, negotiate and offer to commit and to
effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, behavioral limitations
on the assets or businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (iii) propose, negotiate and offer to commit and to effect (and if such
offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the termination, modification, transfer or
other action with respect to any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (iv)
otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action that it is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, take or commit to
take such action, that limits or affects its freedom of action; and (v) in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other
Order of any Governmental Entity is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Proceeding that would make
consummation of the Transactions unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the Transactions, any and all steps
(including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this Section
5.7(e)) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or Order; provided, however, that Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not
be obligated to take the foregoing actions contemplated by this sentence, in each case, to the extent such actions would have or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Parent’s obligations under this Section 5.7(e) shall be absolute and not qualified by “commercially reasonable efforts” or
“reasonable best efforts.” The entry by any Governmental Entity in any Proceeding of an Order permitting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby but requiring any of the steps contemplated by clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this Section 5.7(e) shall
not, individually or in the aggregate, be deemed a failure to satisfy any condition specified in Article 6.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.7, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing, neither Parent nor any
of its affiliates shall acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of
the assets of or any equity in, or by any other manner, any assets or Person, if the
A-60

execution and delivery of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition would be reasonably expected to
prevent the consummation of the Transactions by the Outside Date.
5.8 Employee Benefit Matters
(a) During the period commencing at the Closing Date and ending on the date that is twelve months following the Closing Date (the
“Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to provide to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a “Continuing Employee”), during any
period of employment with the Surviving Corporation during the Continuation Period, (i) an annual base salary or wage rate and a target
annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less than the annual base salary or wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation and
defined benefit pension benefits) that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to the other compensation and benefits (excluding
equity and equity-based compensation and defined benefit pension benefits) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time. During the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide each Continuing Employee with the severance benefits set forth on Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.
(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.8(a), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period or, if sooner, until all
obligations thereunder have been satisfied, each Company Benefit Plan, in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, in accordance
with the terms of such Company Benefit Plans. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall impede Parent’s ability to amend each
Company Benefit Plan in accordance with the terms therein.
(c) In furtherance of Section 5.8(a)(i), if the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment of any outstanding amounts under each
Company Benefit Plan that is a fiscal 2022 cash-based short-term bonus plan (a “2022 Bonus Plan”), Parent shall, or shall cause its
affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to (A) pay, at the time that the Company and its Subsidiaries would
have customarily made such bonus payments, a bonus to each Continuing Employee who participates in a 2022 Bonus Plan that is no
less than the amount earned (but not paid) for such Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date under each such 2022 Bonus Plan, as
determined and paid in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the conditions of, the applicable 2022 Bonus Plan, and (B) to the
extent the Effective Time occurs in calendar year 2022, maintain the 2022 Bonus Plans on the same terms and conditions, and with
respect to the same targets and performance measures, as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that bonuses paid to Continuing Employees under such 2022 Bonus Plans shall be paid at no less than target.
(d) With respect to benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation (including
any vacation, paid time-off and
A-61
Table of Contents
severance plans, but excluding any plan providing for qualified or non-qualified defined benefit pension benefits, nonqualified deferred
compensation, equity or equity-based compensation, or post-termination or retiree health or welfare benefits), for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, each Continuing Employee’s service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as reflected in the Company’s records, shall be treated as service with Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.
(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to use reasonable efforts to, waive, or cause
to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of insurability, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation, to use reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.
(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, the provisions of this Section 5.8 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no Continuing Employee or other current or former service provider of the Company (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.8
shall create such rights in any such individuals. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i) guarantee employment for any period of
time or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee at any time and for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates to
continue any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof following the Closing; or (iii) amend any Company Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans, programs or
Contracts.
5.9 Indemnification.
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and shall advance expenses as incurred by, to the fullest extent permitted under (i) applicable Law, (ii) the Company
A-62
Table of Contents
Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iii) any Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement, each present and former director and officer of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (in each case, when acting
in such capacity) (each, an “Indemnitee” and, collectively, the “Indemnitees”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any actual or alleged
Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with (A) this Agreement or the Transactions and
(B) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee.
(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in
respect of, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions)
existing as of the Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each
of their respective employees who serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (in each case, when acting in such capacity) as
provided in its certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of the applicable party’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organization documents in effect as of the
date of this Agreement or in any Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or
employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such Proceeding.
(c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and severally responsible
for maintaining for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date,
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the “D&O
Insurance”) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of the Company,
or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, it being understood
A-63
Table of Contents
that if the total premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost equal to such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and
officers with such coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time, including in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be permitted, at its sole discretion, to obtain such prepaid policies (subject to the
aforementioned premium cap) that provide such coverage prior to the Effective Time.
(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.9.
(e) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such individual may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organization documents in effect as of
the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
obligations of Parent under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.9).
(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification or advancement of expenses
provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.
5.10 Parent Agreements Concerning Merger Sub. During the period from the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective
Time and the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 7, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activity of any nature
except for activities contemplated by, related to or in furtherance of the Transactions (including enforcement of its rights under this
Agreement) or as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment,
performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of
A-64
Table of Contents
the covenants, agreements, obligations and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and discharge by
Merger Sub hereunder.
5.11 Takeover Statutes. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to
acquire or vote Shares (including any “control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “business combination” or other similar takeover Law)
becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board shall take all actions required to render such Law inapplicable to the
foregoing.
5.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary
to cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting from the Transactions by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
5.13 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors and officers relating to the Transactions, including the Merger. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such litigation that is brought or threatened in writing, and shall keep Parent reasonably and
promptly informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall not settle any such stockholder litigation or related Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
5.14 Stock Exchange Delisting. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company’s securities to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-
registered under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and prior to the Effective Time the Company
shall reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect thereto.
5.15 Publicity. The initial press release announcing this Agreement, any ancillary agreements and the Transactions shall be in substantially
the form mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company. No other press release, public announcement or public filing related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, or prior to the Closing any other announcement or communication to the
employees, customers or suppliers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, shall be issued or made by any party hereto without the joint
approval of Parent and the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by
Law or stock exchange rules; provided that (x) no party hereto shall be required to obtain approval or provide materials for review in
respect of information that has previously been made public without breach of the obligations under this Section 5.15 and contained in
the applicable press release, announcement, public filing or communication,
A-65
Table of Contents
(y) the Company shall not be required to obtain approval or provide materials for review with respect to any matters referred to in, and
made in compliance with, Section 5.3 and (z) Parent and its affiliates shall be permitted to make communications to, and provide
ordinary course information to the Debt Financing Sources, and any equityholders, existing or prospective partners, members, managers
and investors of Parent or its affiliates, in each case, who are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions. In the event that any such
additional press release, public announcement or public filing is required by or advisable under applicable Law or stock exchange rules,
the party obligated to make such press release, public announcement or public filing shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the
other party with reasonable advance notice of such requirement and the content of the proposed press release, announcement or filing
and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such release, announcement or filing and consider in good faith any comments
with respect thereto.
5.16 Company Indebtedness.
(a) On the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall, as and to the extent required by the Indentures relating to the Company’s
Senior Notes in connection with the Transactions, cause to be delivered the officer’s certificate, opinion of counsel and any other notices
or documentation required by the Indentures in connection with the Merger, it being understood that in no event shall the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries be required to bear any out-of-pocket third party cost or expense or pay any fee (other than those costs and fees
that Parent commits to reimburse) in connection with the delivery of such officer’s certificate, opinion or other notices or documentation.
The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such officers’ certificate, legal
opinion and other notices or documentation prior to the delivery thereof, each of which shall be subject to the prior approval of Parent
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(b) Parent or Merger Sub will be permitted to commence and conduct, in accordance with the terms of the Indentures, one or more
offers to purchase, including any “Change of Control Offer” (as such term is defined in the Indentures) and/or any tender offer, or any
exchange offer, and to conduct one or more consent solicitations, if any (each such offer or solicitation by Parent or Merger Sub, a
“Debt Offer” and, collectively, the “Debt Offers”) in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to, and will use its respective reasonable best efforts to cause its
respective affiliates, officers, employees and Representatives (and, in the case of the Company, the trustees under the Indentures) to,
reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith to permit any such Debt Offer to be effected on such terms, conditions
and timing as reasonably requested by Parent, including, if so reasonably requested by Parent, causing any such Debt Offer to be
consummated substantially concurrently with the Closing, and Parent shall, and the Company shall reasonably assist and cooperate with
Parent to, prepare any documentation related thereto, and shall provide the Company reasonable time to review such documentation; it
being understood that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to incur any financing or provide assistance in
obtaining any financing for a Debt Offer other
A-66
Table of Contents
than in connection with the Debt Financing contemplated by Section 5.5 and in accordance with the terms thereof; it being further
understood that no such Debt Offer shall delay the Closing beyond the date that it is required to occur under Section 1.2. The closing
(or, if applicable, operativeness) of the Debt Offers will be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing or the acceptance for
purchase of the applicable Senior Notes by Parent, and the parties will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Offers to close (or
become operative) on the Closing Date. The Debt Offers will be conducted in compliance with the applicable Indentures and applicable
law and the Company will not be required to cooperate with respect to any Debt Offer that would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the terms of the Indentures or applicable law.
(c) Subject to the receipt of any requisite consents, the Company and its Subsidiaries will execute one or more supplemental indentures
to the applicable Indentures in accordance with the Indentures, amending the terms and provisions of the applicable Indentures as
described in the applicable Debt Offer, as reasonably requested by Parent, which supplemental indentures shall become effective upon
the execution thereof and operative no earlier than the Closing Date or the acceptance for purchase of the Senior Notes by Parent, and
will use reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable trustee under the applicable Indentures (the “Trustee”) to enter into such
supplemental indenture; provided, however, that in no event will the Company or any of its officers, directors or other Representatives
have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any amendments or other agreement that would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the terms of the Indentures or applicable law or would become operative before the Closing Date or the time of
acceptance for purchase of the applicable Senior Notes by Parent. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.16, the
Company will provide and will use reasonable best efforts to have its officers and Representatives and Subsidiaries provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the execution of supplemental indentures. If requested by Parent, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its legal counsel to provide all customary legal opinions required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.16 to the extent such legal opinion is required to be delivered before the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company or its legal counsel be required to give an opinion with respect to a Debt
Offer that in the opinion of the Company, its legal counsel or the Trustee, does not comply with applicable law or the applicable
Indenture.
(d) If requested by Parent, in lieu of or in addition to Parent or Merger Sub commencing any Debt Offers for the Senior Notes, the
Company shall (i) send any notices of redemption with respect to all or a portion of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of any
Senior Notes (which shall be in form required under the Indentures and conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing, if sent prior
to the Closing) to the Trustee, (ii) take such actions as may be required under each Indenture to cause the Trustee to proceed with the
redemption of the applicable Senior Notes under such Indenture and to provide the notice of redemption (conditioned upon
consummation of the Closing if provided prior to the Closing) to the holders of such Senior Notes pursuant to the applicable Indenture
and (iii) prepare and deliver all other documents required under each Indenture (including any officer’s certificates and legal opinions) as
may be required under each Indenture to issue notices of redemption
A-67
Table of Contents
(conditioned upon consummation of the Closing, if issued prior to the Closing) for such Senior Notes in accordance with the Indentures,
as well as providing (x) for the redemption on the Closing Date or such later date as shall be specified by Parent for such Senior Notes
or (y) for satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes and the release of any liens with respect thereto on the Closing Date, in each
case, pursuant to the requisite provisions of the applicable Indenture (subject to the consummation of the Closing, if sent prior to the
Closing).
(e) If permitted by the applicable Indenture, the notices of redemption delivered to the Trustee and holders of the Senior Notes (if
delivered prior to Closing) may state that the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any condition to redemption stated
therein shall be satisfied or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event such condition shall not have
been satisfied. On or prior to the Closing, Parent shall make, or cause to be made, a deposit with the Trustee of funds sufficient to pay in
full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of, accrued and unpaid interest through the applicable redemption date on, and
applicable redemption premiums related to, the Senior Notes so redeemed, together with payment of other fees and expenses payable
by the Company under each Indenture.
(f) Promptly following the written request of the Company, Parent shall reimburse the Company or its designee for any reasonable,
documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the assistance required by this Section 5.16. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries

“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means an agreement with the Company or its Subsidiaries that is executed, delivered and
effective after the date hereof, containing provisions that require any counterparty thereto (and any of its affiliates and representatives
named therein) that receive non-public information of or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to keep such information
confidential and refrain from using such information (subject to customary exceptions); provided, however, that, the provisions contained
therein are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Company and its Subsidiaries than the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that such agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the
making of any Acquisition Proposal); provided, however, that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the
Company with any of the provisions of Section 5.3. For the avoidance of doubt, a joinder to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
pursuant to which a Third Party agrees to be bound by the confidentiality and use provisions of an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement shall be an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
“Acquisition Proposal” means, other than a proposal made by Parent or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, any bona fide written offer, proposal, indication of interest or inquiry by a third-party, contemplating or otherwise
relating to any transaction or series of transactions involving any (i) direct or indirect acquisition, purchase or license (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries constituting 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding cash), or to which 25% or more of the net income, revenues or
earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis are attributable for the most recent fiscal year in which audited
financial statements are then available; or (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or issuance (whether in a single transaction or a
A-78

series of related transactions) of record or beneficial ownership of 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the
Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities (including by tender offer, exchange offer, self-tender, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction or series of related transactions) (any transaction described by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), an “Acquisition
Transaction”).
“Acquisition Transaction” has the meaning set forth in the definition of “Acquisition Proposal.”
“affiliate” means, when used with respect to a specified Person, a Person that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries,
controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such specified Person. As used in this definition, the term “control” (including

(a) The parties hereto each acknowledge and agree that the other parties hereto would be damaged irreparably in the event any
provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, and that monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.11,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that the other parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in
any action instituted in any court in the United States or in any state having jurisdiction over the parties hereto and the matter, in addition
to any other remedy to which they may be entitled pursuant hereto or at law or equity (and each party hereto hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy). Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges
and agrees that it shall not assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable Law, or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

Table of Contents
(b) Until such time as Parent pays and the Company accepts the Reverse Termination Fee, the remedies available to the Company
pursuant to this Section 9.11 shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity in accordance with this
Agreement, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company
from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate this Agreement and collect the Reverse Termination Fee under Section 7.2. For the
avoidance of doubt, although the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent permitted by this Section 9.11
and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or
entitled to receive (i) both a grant of specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or
the Equity Commitment Letter) or other equitable relief, on the one hand, and payment of any monetary damages whatsoever and/or the
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, on the other hand, or (ii) both payment of any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one
hand, and payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, on the other hand.
(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall
be entitled to specific performance (i) to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of, this
Agreement (including Section 5.6) by Parent and (ii) to cause Parent to draw down the full proceeds of the Financing and to cause
Parent to consummate the Merger and the Transactions, including to effect the Closing in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions in this Agreement, if, solely in the case of this clause (ii), (A) all conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, (B) Parent fails to complete the Closing
by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (C) the Debt Financing (or, if applicable, the Replacement
Debt Financing) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing (provided that Parent
shall not be required to draw down the Equity Commitment Letter or consummate the Closing if the Debt Financing is not in fact funded
at Closing) and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing (or, if applicable, the Replacement Debt Financing) are funded, then the Company will take such actions
required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES
Section 1. INDEMNIFICATION. The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (an “Indemnitee”) who was or is made or is threatened to be made a
party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including appeals
(a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he, or a person for whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the
corporation or, while a director or officer of the corporation is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by
such Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in this Article V, the corporation shall be
required to indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnitee only if the
commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Indemnitee was authorized by the Board of Directors. The corporation shall
pay the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition,
provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding
shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnitee to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined
that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article V or otherwise. If a claim for indemnification under this Article V
(following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or if a claim for any advancement of expenses under this Article V is
not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefor by the Indemnitee has been received by the corporation, the Indemnitee
may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of
prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.
Section 2. RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE. The rights conferred on any Indemnitee by this Section 14 shall not be exclusive of any other
rights which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these
Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. This Article V shall not limit the right of the
corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Indemnitees
when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.
A-117
Table of Contents
Section 3. INDEMNIFICATION BY THIRD PARTIES. The corporation’s obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to

The Board of Directors
Tenneco Inc.
500 North Field Drive
Lake Forest, Illinois 60045
Dear Members of the Board:
We understand that Tenneco Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Company”), Pegasus Holdings III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(“Parent”), and Pegasus Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which Parent will acquire the Company (the “Transaction”). Pursuant to the
Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company and each issued and outstanding share of Class A voting common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), other than shares of Company Common Stock held by holders who
are entitled to and properly demand an appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock and shares of Company Common Stock held by
the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub (or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Merger Sub),
in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement) (such shares, collectively, “Excluded Shares”), will be
converted into the right to receive $20.00 in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in
the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as of the date hereof as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company Common Stock
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) of the Consideration to be paid to such holders in the Transaction.
In connection with this opinion, we have:
(i) Reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated February 22, 2022, of the Agreement;
(ii) Reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to the Company;
(iii) Reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to us by the Company relating to the business of the Company,
including financial forecasts identified as the “Base Financial Projections” prepared by management of the Company;
(iv) Held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company with respect to the business and prospects of the
Company;
(v) Reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business we believe to be generally relevant in
evaluating the business of the Company;
(vi) Reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business we believe to be generally
relevant in evaluating the business of the Company;
(vii) Reviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Company Common Stock; and
(viii) Conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent verification of such
information. We have not conducted any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the
Company or concerning the solvency or fair value of the Company, and we have not been furnished with any such valuation or appraisal.
Management of the Company has advised us that the Base Financial Projections best reflect the anticipated future financial performance of
the Company

and, accordingly, at the direction of the Company we have utilized the Base Financial Projections forecasts for purposes of our analyses in
connection with this opinion. With respect to the financial forecasts utilized in our analyses, we have assumed, with the consent of the
Company, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future
financial performance of the Company. We assume no responsibility for and express no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions on
which they are based.
Further, our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on circumstances or events
occurring after the date hereof. We do not express any opinion as to the price at which shares of Company Common Stock may trade at any
time subsequent to the announcement of the Transaction. Although we did solicit indications of interest from third parties with respect to a
potential transaction involving a portion of the Company, we were not authorized to, and we did not, solicit indications of interest from third
parties regarding a potential transaction involving the whole Company. In addition, our opinion does not address the relative merits of the
Transaction as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company might engage or the merits of the underlying
decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms
described in the Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any terms or conditions that would be material to our analyses.
Representatives of the Company have advised us, and we have assumed, that the Agreement, when executed, will conform to the draft
reviewed in all material respects. We also have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that obtaining the necessary governmental,
regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the Transaction will not have an adverse effect on the Company or the Transaction that
would be material to our analyses. We do not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the
Transaction, nor does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which we understand that the Company
obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects
(other than the Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein) of the Transaction, including, without limitation, the form or structure of
the Transaction or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the Transaction. In addition, we
express no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers,
directors or employees of any parties to the Transaction, or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise.
Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (“Lazard”) is acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for
such services, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the
closing of the Transaction. We in the past have provided certain investment banking services to the Company, for which we have received
compensation, including, during the past two years, having been engaged to advise on corporate preparedness matters. In addition, we in the
past provided, are currently providing and may in the future provide certain investment banking services to Apollo Global Management, Inc.
and/or certain of its affiliates, for which we have received and may receive compensation, including, during the past two years, having been
engaged to advise on the acquisition of Atlantic Leaf Properties, a potential acquisition and the acquisition of certain real estate assets from
the Italian pension fund Fondazione Ente Nazionale di Previdenza ed Assistenza dei Medici e degli Odontoiatri. In addition, in the ordinary
course, Lazard and its affiliates and employees may trade securities of the Company, Apollo Global Management, Inc. and certain of their
respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers, may at any time hold a long or short position in such
securities, and may also trade and hold securities on behalf of the Company, Apollo Global Management, Inc. and certain of their respective
affiliates. The issuance of this opinion was approved by the Opinion Committee of Lazard.
