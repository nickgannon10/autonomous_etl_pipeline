Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Zendesk and Merger Sub in writing and specified in the
certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL (which we refer to as the “Effective Time”).",11,11

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (a) certain shares of Zendesk common stock that are
issued and outstanding and owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, or held
by Zendesk or its wholly owned subsidiaries, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) shares of

who have properly and validly exercised (and not withdrawn) appraisal rights in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL and (c) shares of Zendesk common stock underlying or comprising
unexercised, unvested or unsettled or not in-the-money Zendesk stock options (i.e., with per share exercise prices
that are equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration (as defined in this section of this proxy statement) and
restricted stock unit awards (which we refer to, collectively, as the “Unconverted Shares”)) will be converted
automatically into the right to receive $77.50 in cash, without interest (which we refer to as the “Merger
Consideration”), subject to any required tax withholding.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a designated paying agent a cash
amount that is sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding amounts payable through Zendesk’s
or its subsidiaries’ payroll systems) in exchange for all shares of Zendesk common stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Unconverted Shares). For more information, please see the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of
Zendesk common stock that you own (other than any Unconverted Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time
(subject to any required tax withholding), but you will no longer have any rights as a Zendesk stockholder (except
that Zendesk stockholders who properly and validly exercise and do not withdraw their appraisal rights will not be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and instead shall have a right to receive payment of the “fair value” of
their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by the DGCL). For more information,
please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal
Rights.”
Treatment of Zendesk Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time: each restricted stock unit award (which we refer to, each,
as an “RSU Award”) and option to purchase shares of Zendesk common stock under the Zendesk stock plans (which
we refer to, each, as a “Stock Option”) that are vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming
achievement of performance for performance-based RSU Awards using the same formula provided for in the
applicable award agreement) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the total number of shares of Zendesk common stock subject to such award and (y) the Merger
Consideration (and for Stock Options, less the exercise price per share of Zendesk common stock subject to such
Stock Option) (which we refer to as the “Cash Amount”), less any required tax withholding and deductions. Stock
Options with per share exercise prices that are equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled for
no consideration. Any unvested Stock Option that is in-the-money and any unvested RSU Award will be canceled
and converted into a cash award for the corresponding Cash Amount (with the number of RSU Awards so converted
determined by assuming achievement of performance for performance-based RSU Awards using the same formula
provided for in the applicable award agreement), with such cash awards being subject to the same time-vesting terms
and conditions that applied to the associated award, as applicable (except for performance-based vesting conditions),
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Zendesk MA.Pdf,Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The exchange of Zendesk common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal
1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who
exchanges shares of Zendesk common stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Zendesk common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such
U.S. Holder.
With respect to a non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of Zendesk
common stock for cash in the Merger generally will not result in tax to that

non-U.S. Holder under United States federal income tax laws unless that non-U.S. Holder has certain connections
with the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the non-U.S. Holder complies with
certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.
This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or other tax
consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal tax law.
Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you of the
Merger.
Appraisal Rights",12,13
Zendesk MA.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Zendesk stockholders who continuously hold shares
of Zendesk common stock through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to
seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the
DGCL. This means that Zendesk stockholders may be entitled to have their shares of Zendesk common stock
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
Zendesk common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the
amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each
Zendesk stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, Zendesk stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged
to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Zendesk stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that
they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of Zendesk
common stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, Zendesk stockholders must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to Zendesk before
the vote of Zendesk stockholders is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (b) not submit a proxy or
otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue to hold shares of Zendesk
common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (d) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising
appraisal rights under the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the
loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of
Zendesk unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the Zendesk stockholders seeking appraisal. The
DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which is
qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A
copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of
Zendesk common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you
should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a
demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. For more information, please see the
section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights.”",13,13

(filed August 3, 2022), Whitfield v. Zendesk, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-06631 (filed August 4, 2022) and Ciccotelli v.
Zendesk, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-06654 (filed August 5, 2022), were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. One complaint, captioned Butler v. Zendesk, Inc., et al., No. 3:22-cv-04414 (filed July 29, 2022),
was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaints name Zendesk and its
directors as defendants. The complaints allege, among other
4TABLE OF CONTENTS
things, that the defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially false and misleading preliminary proxy statement
with the SEC relating to the Merger in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder. The plaintiffs seek as relief, among other things, injunctive relief preventing defendants from
filing a definitive proxy statement and from consummating the Merger unless additional disclosures are made,
rescission of the Merger in the event the Merger is consummated or awarding of rescissory damages, relief directing
the defendants to account to plaintiffs for all damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations, and an award of
costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses. On August 7, 2022, one
purported Zendesk stockholder sent a draft complaint, and another purported Zendesk stockholder sent a demand
letter, each alleging to have identified materially misleading and incomplete statements in the preliminary proxy
statement.
Additionally, Zendesk received a demand letter dated August 5, 2022 on behalf of a purported Zendesk stockholder
pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL requesting to inspect certain of Zendesk’s books and records relating to, among
other things, the Merger.
Zendesk believes the claims asserted in each of the lawsuits, draft complaint and demand letters are without merit.

anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, and to pay
the fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, will
be approximately $10.47 billion, taking into account cash and cash equivalents of Zendesk and its subsidiaries on
hand at the Closing. This amount includes funds needed to: (a) pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of
the Zendesk common stock (other than the Unconverted Shares), (b) make payments in respect of the vested and
outstanding Zendesk equity awards payable in connection with the Closing, and (c) make payments of cash (i) in
connection with an offer to purchase the Existing Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to the holders thereof

conversion of the Existing Notes in connection with any Fundamental Change and Make-Whole Fundamental
Change (each as defined in the Existing Notes Indentures, as defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case on or

The Equity Financing Sources have committed to capitalize Parent at the Closing with an aggregate equity
contribution equal to approximately $6.32 billion, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letters (we refer to such financing as the “Equity Financing”). Zendesk is an express third-party
beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters solely with respect to enforcing Parent’s right to cause the
commitments under the Equity Commitment Letters by each Equity Financing Source to be funded to Parent in
accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters, and to cause Parent to enforce its rights against each such Equity
Financing Source to perform its obligations under the applicable Equity Commitment Letter, in each case subject to
(a) the limitations and conditions set forth in each Equity Commitment Letter and (b) the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement.
Zendesk, Parent and the Equity Financing Sources have entered into certain Fee Funding Agreements, pursuant to
which, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, each Equity Financing Source has agreed to pay a
portion of the payment of the Parent Termination Fee and certain fees and expenses payable by Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
In addition, in connection with the Merger Agreement, (a) Parent entered into a Debt Commitment Letter with the
Debt Commitment Parties pursuant to which the Debt Commitment Parties have committed to provide

Parent with debt financing consisting of a $3.75 billion senior secured term loan facility, a senior secured delayed
draw term loan facility and a $350 million senior secured revolving credit facility, in each case on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (which we refer to, collectively, as the “Debt

Sources pursuant to which the Preferred Equity Financing Sources have agreed to provide preferred equity financing
in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the

shares of Zendesk common stock properly cast for the Adjournment Proposal, and (b) when a quorum is not present,
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock representing a majority of the voting
power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. The approval of the Compensation Proposal

Recommendation of the Zendesk Board of Directors",17,17
Zendesk MA.Pdf,Recommendation of the Zendesk Board of Directors,"Recommendation of the Zendesk Board of Directors
The Board of Directors of Zendesk (which we refer to as the “Board of Directors”) has unanimously: (a) determined
that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of Zendesk and its stockholders; (b) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement; (c) resolved to recommend that Zendesk
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement; and (d) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted
for consideration by Zendesk stockholders at the Special Meeting.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2)
“FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Zendesk stockholders, under certain circumstances, the Board of
Directors may qualify, modify, withhold or withdraw the foregoing recommendation under certain circumstances in
response to an Intervening Event (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-
The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”) or in connection with a Superior Proposal
(as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitation of
Alternative Proposals”).
However, the Board of Directors cannot effect a Change of Recommendation (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”)
unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including negotiating with Parent and its
representatives in good faith over a four-business day period to amend or modify the Merger Agreement to obviate
the need for such Change of Recommendation, after which the Board of Directors shall have determined, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make a
Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law. The termination of the Merger Agreement by Parent in the event of a Change of
Recommendation, or by Zendesk following the Board of Directors’ authorization for Zendesk to enter into a definitive
agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal will result in the payment
by Zendesk of a termination fee of $254 million. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement-The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation.”

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, outstanding Zendesk equity awards
(including those held by the executive officers of Zendesk) will be treated as follows, subject to all required tax
withholdings:
•
at the Effective Time, each Stock Option with a per-share exercise price that is less than the amount of the
Merger Consideration (which we refer to, each, as an “in-the-money Stock Option”) and that is vested by
its terms and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the
right to receive, without interest, at the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
total number of shares of Zendesk common stock subject to such Stock Option and (y) the excess, if any, of
the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Zendesk common stock
subject to such Stock Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest
cent (which we refer to, such amount, as the “Aggregate Option Spread Value”);
9TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each in-the-money Stock Option that is then outstanding and not
vested by its terms will be canceled and converted as of the Effective Time into a cash award equal to the
Aggregate Option Spread Value of such Stock Option, which will remain subject to the same time-vesting
terms and conditions that applied to the associated Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the requirement of continued service with the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates through the
applicable vesting date, as applicable, and the applicable cash amounts will be paid out, without interest,
on the next payroll date following the applicable vesting dates, so long as the applicable portion of the
cash award became or becomes vested prior to the applicable holder’s termination of service with the
Surviving Corporation and its affiliates;
•
at the Effective Time, each Stock Option (whether vested or unvested) for which the exercise price per share
is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled at the Closing without payment;
•
at the Effective Time, each RSU Award that is vested by its terms and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (which we refer to each, as, a “vested RSU Award”) will cease to represent a right or award
with respect to shares of Zendesk common stock, will be canceled and will entitle the holder thereof to the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, without interest, at the Effective Time an amount in cash
equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share underlying such RSU Award;
•
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each RSU Award that is then outstanding and not vested by its
terms (which we refer to each, as, an “unvested RSU Award”) will be canceled and converted as of the
Effective Time into a cash award equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Zendesk common
stock subject to such RSU Award and (y) the Merger Consideration (with such number of shares
determined assuming achievement of performance for performance-based unvested RSU Award using the
same formula provided for in the applicable award agreement). Such cash award will remain subject to the
same time-vesting terms and conditions that applied to the associated unvested RSU Award (except for any
performance-based vesting conditions), immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the requirement
of continued service with the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates through the applicable vesting date or
through the end of the original performance period, as applicable, and the applicable cash amounts will be
paid out, without interest, on the next payroll date following the applicable vesting dates, so long as the
applicable portion of the cash award became or becomes vested prior to the applicable holder’s termination
of service with the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Interests of
Zendesk’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to

trigger” treatment; and for the estimated aggregate value of the unvested Zendesk equity awards that will be held by
Zendesk’s nonemployee directors as of the Closing Date (all of which are vested RSU Awards), which are afforded

Restrictions on Solicitation of Alternative Proposals",18,19
Zendesk MA.Pdf,Restrictions on Solicitation of Alternative Proposals,"Restrictions on Solicitation of Alternative Proposals
Under the Merger Agreement, Zendesk may not: (a) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to the submission or announcement
of, or constitute any Alternative Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitation of Alternative Proposals”); (b) enter into or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding, or furnish any nonpublic information or access to any
third party with respect to, any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal (other than supplying nonpublic information in the ordinary course of
business in a manner that is not reasonably expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal); (c) engage in discussions
with any third party that has made or, to the knowledge of Zendesk, is considering making an Alternative Proposal
(except to notify any person of the existence of the
10TABLE OF CONTENTS
restrictions on solicitation of Alternative Proposals set forth in the Merger Agreement), in each case for the purpose
of knowingly, or that would reasonably be expected to be, facilitating, inducing or encouraging an Alternative
Proposal; or (d) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any
Alternative Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, under certain specified circumstances, until the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by Zendesk stockholders, Zendesk may, among other things, provide information to, and engage in
discussions or negotiations with, a person in respect of an Alternative Proposal if, subject to complying with certain
procedures, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisors and
its outside legal counsel) that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be
expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitation of Alternative Proposals.”
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Zendesk stockholders, Zendesk is entitled to terminate the Merger
Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal if it complies with certain
procedures in the Merger Agreement, including (a) giving Parent at least four business days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, (b) during such four-business-day period, considering and discussing with Parent in
good faith any adjustments or modifications to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent and (c) at the
end of such four-business day period, the Board of Directors again determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal advisors and financial advisors) that, after taking into account any adjustments or modifications to
the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent during such four-business-day period, such Superior
Proposal continues to be a “Superior Proposal.”
The termination of the Merger Agreement by Zendesk in connection with the Board of Directors’ authorization for
Zendesk to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior
Proposal will result in the payment by Zendesk of a termination fee of $254 million. For more information, please see

Agreement under customary circumstances, including by mutual agreement, the imposition of a final and non-
appealable injunction that permanently restrains, enjoins, suspends or otherwise prohibits the Merger, an uncured
breach of the Merger Agreement by the other party, if the Merger has not been consummated by 11:59 p.m. New York
City time on March 24, 2023 (which we refer to as the “End Date”) or if Zendesk stockholders fail to adopt the Merger

The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger
Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important
to you. You should carefully read and consider the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy
statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents
we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and
how it affects you. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge

Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
The Board of Directors is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the Zendesk stockholders in
connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the Special Meeting.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting is scheduled to be held virtually via live webcast on September 19, 2022, at 10:00 a.m.
Pacific Time (unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed). There will not be a physical meeting
location. In light of continuing public health and travel concerns arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, Zendesk
believes hosting a virtual meeting helps ensure the health and safety of its stockholders, the Board of Directors
and Zendesk management. Additionally, the virtual nature of the Special Meeting is generally designed to
enable participation of and access by more Zendesk stockholders while decreasing the cost of conducting the
Special Meeting. 
Zendesk stockholders will be able to virtually attend and vote at the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ZEN2022SM, which we refer to as the “Special Meeting website.” We
encourage you to access the Special Meeting before it begins. Online check-in will start approximately 15
minutes before the Special Meeting is scheduled to begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on September 19, 2022.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal;
•
to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and
•
to approve the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Zendesk stockholders as of the Record Date of August 4, 2022 are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and
to vote at the Special Meeting. Each holder of shares of Zendesk common stock shall be entitled to cast one
vote on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each such share owned at the close of
business on the Record Date. Virtual attendance at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website is not
required to vote.
Q:
May I attend and vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
All Zendesk stockholders as of the Record Date may attend and vote at the Special Meeting.
Shares held directly in your name as a Zendesk stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via
the Special Meeting website. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special
Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Even if you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or
by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement
12TABLE OF CONTENTS
entitled “The Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting”) so that your vote will be counted if you later
decide not to or become unable to virtually attend the Special meeting. If you attend the Special Meeting and
vote thereat, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $77.50 in cash,
without interest, subject to any required tax withholding, for each share of Zendesk common stock that you own
(other than any Unconverted Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you have properly and
validly exercised and do not withdraw your appraisal rights in accordance with and complied with Section 262 of
the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of Zendesk common stock, you will receive $7,750 in cash in
exchange for your shares of Zendesk common stock (other than any Unconverted Shares), without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes. Unconverted Shares means (a) certain shares of Zendesk common stock
that are issued and outstanding and owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or its subsidiaries, including Merger
Sub, or held by Zendesk or its wholly owned subsidiaries, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(b) shares of Zendesk common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that are held by holders who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who have
properly and validly exercised (and not withdrawn) appraisal rights in accordance with, and who have complied
with, Section 262 of the DGCL and (c) shares of Zendesk common stock underlying or comprising unexercised,
unvested or unsettled or not in-the-money Stock Options (i.e., with per share exercise prices that are equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration (as defined in this section of this proxy statement)) and RSU Awards.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?
A:
The exchange of Zendesk common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder who exchanges shares of Zendesk common stock for
cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
shares of Zendesk common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S. Holder.
With respect to a non-U.S. Holder, the exchange of Zendesk common stock for cash in the Merger generally will
not result in tax to that non-U.S. Holder under United States federal income tax laws unless that non-U.S. Holder
has certain connections with the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the non-
U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from
backup withholding tax.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger. This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or
other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal
tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you
of the Merger.
Q:
What will I receive for my RSU Award and Stock Options in the Merger?
A:
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time:
•
RSU Awards and in-the-money Stock Options that are vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming achievement of performance for performance-based RSU Awards using the same formula
provided for in the applicable award agreement) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
Cash Amount equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Zendesk common stock subject to
such award and (y) the Merger Consideration (and for Stock Options, less the exercise price per share of
Zendesk common stock subject to such Stock Option), less any required tax withholding and deductions.
•
Stock Options with per share exercise prices that are equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will
be canceled for no consideration.
•
Any unvested in-the-money Stock Option and any unvested RSU Award will be canceled and converted
into a cash award for the Cash Amount (assuming achievement of performance for performance-based
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
RSU Awards using the same formula provided for in the applicable award agreement), with such cash
awards being subject to the same time-vesting terms and conditions that applied to the associated award,
as applicable (except for performance-based vesting conditions), immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock entitled to
vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares of Zendesk common stock properly cast for the Compensation Proposal is required to approve the
Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of either (a) a majority of the shares of Zendesk common stock
properly cast for the Adjournment Proposal, when a quorum is present, or (b) the affirmative vote of the holders
of the shares of Zendesk common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, when a quorum is not present, is required, as applicable, for
approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any Zendesk stockholder of record to: (a) submit a
signed proxy card; (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions
detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting”); or
(c) vote virtually at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement
Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,
the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Each
“broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum
is not present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal. If you
properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter,
the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Zendesk stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any
other reason, Zendesk stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Zendesk common stock.
Instead, Zendesk will remain an independent public company, Zendesk common stock will continue to be listed
and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and Zendesk will continue to file periodic
reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, Zendesk will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $254 million, upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Termination Fees.”
Q:
Why are Zendesk stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation
Proposal?
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Zendesk to seek an advisory (nonbinding) vote
with respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with
the Merger.
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What will happen if Zendesk stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with
respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Zendesk. Therefore, if the
approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable
under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Zendesk’s named executive officers in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,
including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as
they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign,
date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant
your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting”), so that your
shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting
instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q:
Should I surrender my certificates or book-entry shares now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures”) will send each holder of record a letter of
transmittal (or an online portal for holders of record with valid email addresses if the Paying Agent does not
customarily require a letter of transmittal) and written instructions that explain how to exchange shares of
Zendesk common stock represented by such holder’s certificates or book-entry shares for the Merger
Consideration.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Zendesk common stock after the Record Date but
before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger
is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of Zendesk common stock after the Record Date
but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between
you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Zendesk in
writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the
Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to
vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Zendesk common
stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in
accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting-
Voting at the Special Meeting”).
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a Zendesk stockholder of record and holding shares in
“street name” as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered to
be the “stockholder of record” with respect to those shares. In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy
card have been sent directly to you by Zendesk.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of Zendesk common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to
you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the Zendesk
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee
how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the virtual
Special Meeting.

directions on how to provide voting instructions. These directions may allow you to vote over the Internet or
by telephone.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy to
ensure your vote is counted. We encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone, both of
which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail. You may still
attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat if you have already voted by proxy.
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the
Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy
card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be
responsible.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically
over the Internet or by telephone.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is a Zendesk stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such Zendesk
stockholder on their behalf. If you are a Zendesk stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet,
by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares
beneficially in “street name,” you should follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee.
Q:
If a Zendesk stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy before the Special Meeting in the manner described in this proxy
statement. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy by any of the
following actions:
•
You may vote again over the Internet or by telephone as instructed on your proxy card before the closing
of the voting facilities at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 18, 2022.
•
You may submit another properly signed proxy card with a later date, provided such proxy card is received
no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 18, 2022.
•
You may send a signed written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Zendesk’s Corporate Secretary at
989 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, provided such written notice is received no later than the close
of business on September 16, 2022.
•
You may attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat. Simply attending the virtual Special Meeting will not,
by itself, revoke your proxy.
If you hold your shares of Zendesk common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or
other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via
the Special Meeting website.
If you have any questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy solicitor:

Email: proxy@mackenziepartners.com
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
This means you own shares of Zendesk common stock that are registered under different names or are in more
than one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a Zendesk stockholder of record and other
shares through a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will
receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the
instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all
of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit
your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy
card.
Q:
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address
with another Zendesk stockholder?
A:
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for
proxy statements with respect to two or more Zendesk stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a
single proxy statement to those Zendesk stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as
“householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for Zendesk stockholders and cost savings for
companies.
Zendesk and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy
materials to multiple Zendesk stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
instructions have been received from the affected Zendesk stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish to
participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is
receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single
copy, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Zendesk if you are a Zendesk
stockholder of record by making a request to our Corporate Secretary at 989 Market Street, San Francisco, CA
94103 or by calling (415) 418-7506. In addition, Zendesk will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the
address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
The preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In
addition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, Zendesk will file the final
voting results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been certified, the preliminary
results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
Zendesk has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc., which we refer to as “MacKenzie,” to assist in the solicitation
of proxies for the Special Meeting. Zendesk estimates that it will pay MacKenzie a fee of approximately $50,000,
plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Zendesk has agreed to indemnify MacKenzie
against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain
exceptions).
Zendesk also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective
agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of Zendesk common stock. Zendesk
directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in person. They
will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect to complete the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the exact timing of
completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified
in the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q:
How can I obtain additional information about Zendesk?
A:
Zendesk will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2022 Annual
Report to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,
as amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A and Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A (which we refer to,
collectively, as “Annual Report”), without charge to any Zendesk stockholder who makes a request in writing or
by telephone to Zendesk’s Corporate Secretary at 989 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 or (415) 418-7506.
If you would like to request documents from us, please do so as soon as possible to receive them before the
Special Meeting. Zendesk’s Annual Report and other SEC filings may also be accessed at https://sec.gov or on
Zendesk’s Investor website at https://investor.zendesk.com/. Zendesk’s website address is provided as an
inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is not part of this
proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other reference to our website
provided in this proxy statement.
Q:
Who can help answer my questions?
A:

would like additional copies of the accompanying proxy statement or need help voting your shares of Zendesk
common stock, please contact our proxy solicitor:

Only Zendesk stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the
Special Meeting. A list of Zendesk stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our
principal executive offices located at 989 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, during regular business hours for a
period of no less than 10 days before the Special Meeting, as well as on the Special Meeting website. If Zendesk’s
headquarters are closed during such period for health and safety reasons related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the list of
Zendesk stockholders will be made available for inspection upon request to our Corporate Secretary at 989 Market
Street, San Francisco, California 94103, subject to the satisfactory verification of Zendesk stockholder status. The list
will also be available electronically during the Special Meeting on the Special Meeting website. As of the Record
Date, there were 123,465,884 shares of Zendesk common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting.
The presence, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Zendesk common stock
entitled to vote on the Record Date will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not
present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the Special Meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

Zendesk MA.Pdf,Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes,"Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
Each Zendesk stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Zendesk common stock owned at the close
of business on the Record Date.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock entitled to vote
thereon is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. As of the Record Date, 61,732,943 votes constitute a
majority of the outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by Zendesk
stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the Merger.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Zendesk common stock properly cast for the
Compensation Proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
The affirmative vote of either (a) a majority of the shares of Zendesk common stock properly cast for the
Adjournment Proposal, when a quorum is present, or (b) the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Zendesk
common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting, when a quorum is not present, is required, as applicable, for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, for Zendesk stockholders who attend the Special Meeting or are
represented by proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the Zendesk stockholder
voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
21TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A so-called
“broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or
matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal
because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting
instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. Zendesk does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary
authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine,” whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the
Special Meeting is considered “non-routine.” As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Zendesk
common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote
your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

Special Meeting website (unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed).
You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by returning the proxy
card in advance by mail, over the Internet or by telephone. Although Zendesk offers four different voting methods,
Zendesk encourages you to vote over the Internet or by phone as Zendesk believes they are the most cost-effective
methods. We also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the Special
Meeting, so that the vote count will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-
effective and reliable alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares over the
Internet or by telephone, there is no need for you to submit your proxy card by mail.
To Vote Over the Internet:
Vote at www.proxyvote.com in advance of the Special Meeting. The Internet voting system is available 24 hours per
day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 18, 2022. Once you enter the Internet voting system, you can record
and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
To Vote by Telephone:
Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available 24 hours per day in
the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 18, 2022. Once you enter the telephone voting system, a
series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
To Vote by Proxy Card:
If you received a proxy card, mark your voting instructions on the card and sign, date and return it in the postage-
paid envelope provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on September 18, 2022.
All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received by the deadline indicated above will be voted
at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the Zendesk stockholder. Properly signed and dated
proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR”
the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. If you indicate on your proxy card that you
wish to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal but do not indicate a choice on
22TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal on a nonbinding advisory basis, your shares of Zendesk
common stock will be voted “FOR” each such proposal. Proxy cards that are returned without a signature will not be
counted as present at the Special Meeting and cannot be voted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank,
broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee
or attending the Special Meeting and voting using your control number, or, if you did not obtain a control number,
contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number so that you may vote. If such a service is
provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the
instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s,
broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other
nominee, if possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, it will have the same effect as if you

over the Internet, in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting” at any time before the closing of the voting facilities
at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 18, 2022;
•
by submitting a properly signed and dated proxy card with a date later than the date of the previously
submitted proxy relating to the same shares of Zendesk common stock, provided such proxy card is
received no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 18, 2022;
•
by delivering a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to
Zendesk’s Corporate Secretary at 989 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, stating that the proxy is
revoked, provided such written notice is received no later than the close of business on September 16,
2022; or
•
by attending the virtual Special Meeting and voting thereat (your attendance at the virtual Special Meeting
will not, by itself, revoke your proxy).
If you hold your shares of Zendesk common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the virtual Special Meeting with
your control number, or, if you did not obtain a control number, by contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to
obtain a control number.

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, Zendesk stockholders who continuously hold shares of Zendesk common stock
through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and properly demand
appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means
that Zendesk stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal,
and follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
Zendesk common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the
amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each
Zendesk stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, Zendesk stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged
to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights.
Zendesk stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to Zendesk before the vote is
taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (b) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue to hold your shares of Zendesk common stock of record through the
Effective Time; and (d) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the
loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in
respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the Zendesk stockholders seeking
appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its
entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section
262 of the DGCL is reproduced and attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by
reference. If you hold your shares of Zendesk common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and
you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to
determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or
nominee.

Background of the Merger
As part of Zendesk’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of
Directors and Zendesk management, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, regularly review, consider
and assess Zendesk’s performance, future growth prospects, evolving industry landscape, customer opportunities,
product portfolio and overall strategic direction in light of the current and anticipated business, technology and
economic environment and in consideration of Zendesk’s long-term business strategy to enhance value for Zendesk
stockholders. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for business
combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives. The Board of Directors has also regularly
engaged with Zendesk stockholders to discuss and solicit their perspectives on Zendesk’s strategic and financial
direction.
On October 28, 2021, Zendesk announced after market that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Momentive
Global Inc., which we refer to as the “Momentive Transaction.” The Momentive Transaction was subject to Zendesk
stockholder approval due to the amount of Zendesk common stock required to be issued to consummate the
transaction. A special meeting of Zendesk common stockholders to vote on the Momentive Transaction was later set
for February 25, 2022.
The closing price of Zendesk common stock the day the Momentive Transaction was announced after market was
$119.01 per share. The closing price on the following day was $101.80, which represented a share price decline of
14.5%. On that day, the NASDAQ Composite Index was 15,448, the IGV ETF (an index composed of North American
equities in the expanded tech-software sector which includes Zendesk) was 435.63 and the BVP Emerging Cloud
Index (an index designed to track emerging public companies primarily involved in providing cloud software to
customers which includes Zendesk) was 2,954.
On November 30, 2021, JANA Partners, a stockholder of Zendesk, sent an open letter to the Board of Directors
expressing its opposition to the Momentive Transaction and stating JANA Partners’ intent to vote against the
issuance of Zendesk common stock required to consummate the Momentive Transaction.
On February 7, 2022, the Board of Directors received an unsolicited, preliminary nonbinding proposal from a
consortium of private equity firms consisting of Permira, H&F and a financial sponsor (which we refer to as “Financial
Sponsor A,” and together with Permira and H&F, the “Consortium”), regarding a potential acquisition of Zendesk for
an indicative price range of between $127.00 and $132.00 per share in cash, subject to initiating and completing due
diligence, the negotiation of definitive transaction documents and approval from the Consortium members’ respective
investment committees prior to entry into final definitive agreements. The Consortium’s preliminary nonbinding
proposal was based solely on public information, as the Consortium had not received confidential information from
Zendesk, with the Consortium indicating they and their advisors would need access to Zendesk’s business plan and
Company non-public data. On February 7, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk common stock was $98.43 per share.
28TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 9, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting, together with its outside financial advisors, including
Goldman Sachs, which had been engaged to act as financial advisor to Zendesk in connection with the Momentive
Transaction, as well as its legal advisors, including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which we refer to as “Wachtell
Lipton.” Following a review from representatives of its outside financial advisors of certain preliminary financial
aspects and analyses of the Consortium’s preliminary nonbinding proposal and discussion among the participants of
such financial analyses and the legal duties of the Board of Directors in connection with the evaluation of such
preliminary nonbinding proposal, the Board of Directors concluded that the Consortium’s preliminary nonbinding
proposal significantly undervalued Zendesk and that it was not in the best interests of Zendesk and its stockholders
to alter Zendesk’s existing strategic plan and pursue the proposed transaction with the Consortium.
On February 10, 2022, Zendesk issued a press release announcing its rejection of the Consortium’s preliminary
nonbinding proposal.
On February 16, 2022, JANA Partners sent another open letter to the Board of Directors reiterating its opposition to
the Momentive Transaction and declaring its intent to nominate four director nominees for election to the Board of
Directors at Zendesk’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. JANA Partners also stated in the letter its belief that
Zendesk should engage with interested strategic and financial buyers to explore a sale of Zendesk. That same day,
JANA Partners submitted a notice of nomination to Zendesk. Also that day, Zendesk issued a press release
confirming receipt of JANA Partners’ notice of director nomination and stating that it would carefully review and
evaluate the JANA Partners’ director nominees.
During the period prior to the February 25, 2022 special meeting of Zendesk stockholders held in connection with the
Momentive Transaction, members of the Board of Directors and Zendesk management engaged in meetings and
active dialogue with Zendesk stockholders, including with JANA Partners. These discussions often concerned,
among other things, the Momentive Transaction, governance matters, Zendesk’s stock price performance and
potential strategic alternatives, including the unsolicited preliminary nonbinding proposal from the Consortium.
On February 25, 2022, at the special meeting of Zendesk stockholders, a majority of votes cast by Zendesk
stockholders did not vote to approve the issuance of Zendesk common stock in connection with the Momentive
Transaction. Thereafter, Zendesk issued a press release announcing the termination of the Momentive Transaction.
On February 25, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk common stock was $115.48 per share.
On February 28, 2022, JANA Partners sent another open letter to the Board of Directors stating its belief that Zendesk
required either significant board change, or in the absence of such change, should be sold.
At a meeting held on March 7, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed Zendesk’s business and strategic
plan, the current situation and the options and strategic alternatives potentially available to Zendesk, including
Zendesk’s then current position and prospects as a standalone entity, the evolving competitive landscape, the
pressure on high-growth SaaS company share prices and multiples, the recent interest by the Consortium in a
potential acquisition of Zendesk and JANA Partners’ initiation of a proxy contest seeking representation on the
Board of Directors. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed a range of potential strategic alternatives,
including continuing to execute on its standalone plan and whether it was the right time to consider a review of
strategic alternatives that could, among other things, lead to a potential sale of Zendesk, and considerations
associated with each alternative. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also provided the Board of Directors with an
overview of a potential process for the sale of Zendesk, including illustrative timelines and stages for such a process
and potential counterparties that might be interested in such a transaction. The Board of Directors, together with
members of Zendesk management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, discussed the list of potential
counterparties and various considerations associated with reaching out to, and pursuing a strategic transaction with,
such parties. After discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors determined to explore more intensively a
potential process to review strategic alternatives for Zendesk. On March 7, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk
common stock was $113.33 per share. Since October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement of the Momentive
Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 17%, the IGV ETF had declined
approximately 28% and the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 42%.
At a meeting held on March 9, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed the potential engagement of Qatalyst

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Partners and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors to Zendesk in connection with a potential strategic review process,
given their experience, expertise and qualifications. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of
Directors its fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with a potential strategic review process, including
considerations in connection with pursuing either a standalone strategy or a sale of Zendesk.
At a meeting held on March 16, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed Qatalyst Partners’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective draft
engagement letters and relationship disclosure letters made available to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting.
The Board of Directors and representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed certain of Qatalyst Partners’ and Goldman
Sachs’ prior relationships with members of the Consortium and/or their respective affiliates as well as Goldman Sachs’
role as a counterparty to Zendesk’s capped call options that had been disclosed, as further described in the section
of this proxy statement entitled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.” The Board of Directors reviewed the
disclosures and determined that none of the disclosed relationships would impact Qatalyst Partners’ or Goldman
Sachs’ ability to act in an independent and disinterested manner in rendering their services to the Board of Directors
in connection with the potential transaction and approved Zendesk’s entry into the engagement letters with Qatalyst
Partners and Goldman Sachs, respectively.
Thereafter, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs joined the meeting, and the Board of Directors,
together with members of Zendesk management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and
Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed considerations relating to a potential strategic review process, including as
to the then current market backdrop, the valuation of Zendesk, investor sentiment about Zendesk, the pending proxy
contest with JANA Partners, and the recent interest in an acquisition of Zendesk by the Consortium. After
discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors (i) determined to commence a process to review strategic
alternatives, including a potential sale of Zendesk, (ii) authorized representatives of Qatalyst Partners to contact
certain potential counterparties, including the Consortium, to ascertain their interest in a strategic transaction
involving Zendesk, and (iii) authorized Wachtell Lipton, working with Zendesk management, to negotiate and execute
non-disclosure agreements with potential counterparties.
Commencing on March 17, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners began contacting potential counterparties
regarding a potential strategic transaction. At the Board of Directors’ direction, representatives of Qatalyst Partners
contacted 26 potential counterparties (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential co-
investors as one potential counterparty), including 16 potential strategic partners and 10 potential financial sponsors.
Eleven of the 26 potential counterparties (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential
co-investors as one potential counterparty) entered into non-disclosure agreements with Zendesk and were provided
with preliminary due diligence materials. The non-disclosure agreements with nine of the potential counterparties
(including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential co-investors as one potential
counterparty) included standstill provisions, and none of the standstill provisions are currently in effect.
At a meeting held on March 23, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed the then current status of the
strategic review process, including the progress on the outreach to potential counterparties.
At a meeting held on March 30, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, again discussed the then current status of
the strategic review process, including the progress on the outreach to potential counterparties with respect to a
potential transaction and feedback received thus far. Members of Zendesk management also discussed a proposed
long-range plan through calendar year 2025 for Zendesk that would be provided to potential bidders in the strategic
review process.
Between April 4, 2022, and April 20, 2022, Zendesk management conducted initial meetings with 10 potential
counterparties (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential co-investors as one
potential counterparty), including four potential strategic partners and six potential financial sponsors. One potential
strategic partner that had executed a non-disclosure agreement withdrew from the process prior to attending a
management presentation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On April 6, 2022, at the request of the Consortium, Zendesk agreed to allow a limited partner of a member of the
Consortium to join the Consortium as an additional source of equity financing (which we refer to as “Significant LP
Co-Investor A”), based on its belief that such additional equity financing source would increase the likelihood of an
actionable bid to acquire Zendesk.
On April 7, 2022, Zendesk management opened an electronic data room with additional due diligence information and
began providing access to the 10 potential counterparties that had entered into non-disclosure agreements with
Zendesk (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their potential co-investors as one
counterparty). The potential counterparties were also given the opportunity to spend additional time with
representatives of Zendesk management as part of their ongoing diligence.
Also on April 7, 2022, Mr. Carl Bass, the lead independent director of Zendesk, Ms. Hilarie Koplow-McAdams, an
independent director of Zendesk, and members of Zendesk management met with representatives of JANA Partners
to discuss the then current proxy contest. During the discussion, the JANA Partners representatives noted that they
were primarily focused on a change in board composition of Zendesk, or alternatively, a sale of Zendesk. When asked
whether JANA Partners had expectations regarding the value of a potential sale transaction, the representatives of
JANA Partners noted that they did not have a specific expectation but would generally defer to a value that was
reached through a comprehensive sale process.
On or around April 12, 2022, a representative of the Consortium met with Mikkel Svane, the CEO of Zendesk, to
discuss the potential transaction between the Consortium and Zendesk.
At a meeting held on April 13, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed an update on the
strategic review process, including meetings with representatives of Zendesk management and other discussions
that had taken place with the potential counterparties in the process and the perceived level of interest of each party,
as well as the strategic parties and financial sponsors that had indicated that they would not be interested in
pursuing a potential transaction. The Board of Directors also discussed and reviewed the potential proxy contest
with JANA Partners, and continued this discussion at a meeting attended by members of the Board of Directors and a
representative of Wachtell Lipton on April 15, 2022.
On April 14, 2022, at the request of a financial sponsor (which we refer to as “Bidder 2”), Zendesk agreed to allow a
limited partner of Bidder 2 to join Bidder 2 as an additional source of equity financing, based on its belief that such
additional equity financing source would increase the likelihood of an actionable bid to acquire Zendesk.
On April 18, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent a process letter to each of the counterparties that had
entered into non-disclosure agreements with Zendesk, requesting preliminary indications of interest by May 5, 2022.
Also the same day, Bloomberg published an after-hours report that Zendesk was working with Qatalyst Partners and
exploring a potential sale, with the stock price closing on April 19, 2022 at $129.12 per share, an increase of
approximately 6.1% as compared to the closing price on April 18, 2022 of $121.69.
Between April 18, 2022 and April 19, 2022, a summary of financial performance for the first quarter of 2022 and a long-
range plan for Zendesk through calendar year 2025 that had been prepared by Zendesk’s management, as further
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Certain Financial Projections-March 2022 Case,” was
provided to the potential counterparties via the electronic data room. Zendesk achieved revenue of $388.3 million,
representing year-over-year growth of approximately 30% and outperformance relative to the analyst consensus by
approximately 1%, and Annual Recurring Revenue of $1,535 million, representing year-over-year growth of
approximately 30%. However, Zendesk recorded gross bookings of $136.0 million, representing year-over-year growth
of only approximately 6%, which fell below the internal outlook of $159.3 million by 15%, and recorded net bookings
of $86.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of only approximately 4%, which fell below the internal outlook
of $104.3 million by 17%.
On April 19, 2022, at the request of the Consortium, Zendesk agreed to allow a limited partner of a member of the
Consortium to join the Consortium as an additional source of equity financing (which we refer to as “Significant LP
Co-Investor B”), based on its belief that such additional equity financing source would increase the likelihood of an
actionable bid to acquire Zendesk.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
At meetings held on April 20, 2022 and April 26, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed an update on
the strategic review process, including meetings with representatives of Zendesk management and other discussions
that had taken place with the potential counterparties in the process and the perceived level of interest of each
remaining party, as well as the additional strategic parties and financial sponsors that had indicated that they would
not be interested in pursuing a potential transaction. The Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, also discussed potential
alternatives to a sale of Zendesk, as well as updates on recent engagement with its stockholders, including JANA
Partners.
On May 2, 2022, at the request of the Consortium, Zendesk agreed to allow a limited partner of a member of the
Consortium (which we refer to as “Significant LP Co-Investor C”) to join the Consortium as an additional source of
equity financing, based on its belief that such additional equity financing source would increase the likelihood of an
actionable bid to acquire Zendesk.
On May 3, 2022, at the request of Bidder 2, Zendesk agreed to allow a limited partner of Bidder 2 to join Bidder 2 as an
additional source of equity financing, based on its belief that such additional equity financing source would increase
the likelihood of an actionable bid to acquire Zendesk.
On May 4, 2022, prior to the initial deadline for preliminary indications of interest, representatives of Qatalyst Partners
provided to each of the remaining potential bidders in the strategic review process an updated long-range plan for
Zendesk through calendar year 2025 that had been prepared by Zendesk management primarily reflecting certain
changes to the long-range plan previously provided to the bidders, as further described in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “-Certain Financial Projections-March 2022 Case.”
On May 5, 2022, two potential financial counterparties submitted preliminary indications of interest to acquire
Zendesk for cash: the Consortium, which indicated a price of $120.00 per share of Zendesk common stock, and Bidder
2, which indicated a price range of $125.00 to $135.00 per share of Zendesk common stock. In making its submission,
the Consortium noted that (a) its bid remained subject to completion of diligence and (b) the market had corrected
dramatically since submitting its preliminary nonbinding proposal on February 7, 2022, and that if Zendesk were
trading in line with comparable companies and the NASDAQ as a whole and without the impact of speculation
regarding a potential acquisition of Zendesk, it would be trading in the range of $75.00 to $88.00 per share. In making
its submission, Bidder 2 cited market uncertainty and concerns about business momentum, in light of Zendesk’s
performance in the first quarter of 2022, for providing an indication as a range. Bidder 2 also referenced the impact of
speculation regarding a potential acquisition on Zendesk’s then current share price and noted that it believed a share
price of $95.11 per share based on the last closing price of Zendesk common stock on November 29, 2021, prior to
activism by JANA Partners, as being more representative of the unaffected Zendesk share price. On May 5, 2022, the
closing price of Zendesk common stock was $117.73 per share. Since October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement
of the Momentive Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 20%, the IGV ETF had
declined approximately 32% and the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 47%.
At a meeting held on May 6, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed the preliminary
indications of interest received from the Consortium and Bidder 2. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman
Sachs and Wachtell Lipton discussed and reviewed with the Board of Directors the terms and conditions of the
indications of interest, discussing with the Board of Directors the key assumptions underlying the indicative
valuations included in the preliminary indications of interest, proposed financing plans, timing of required internal
and external approvals, as well as diligence requests made by the potential counterparties. Representatives of
Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton also provided the Board of Directors with a possible outline
for the next stages of the strategic review process with the potential counterparties, including the scheduling of
additional diligence sessions, as well as the timing for preparation and negotiation of definitive transaction
documents with respect to a potential transaction. Following discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors
authorized Zendesk’s advisors, working with Zendesk management, to proceed with the process of exploring a
potential sale of Zendesk, permit access to additional diligence materials on Zendesk for each of the Consortium and
Bidder 2 and schedule additional diligence sessions with representatives of each of the Consortium and Bidder 2.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Between May 7, 2022 and May 8, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners had multiple discussions with
representatives of the Consortium and provided guidance to the Consortium that they would need to improve their
proposed price of $120.00 per share.
On May 9, 2022, representatives of the Consortium contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform them that
Financial Sponsor A had withdrawn from the bidding group for a range of reasons, including that Financial Sponsor
A was concerned with worsening market conditions and volatility as well as the inflated nature of Zendesk’s trading
price. Representatives of the Consortium informed Qatalyst Partners that they were working to secure additional
equity financing to enable them to continue in the strategic review process. On May 9, 2022, the closing price of
Zendesk common stock was $99.14 per share.
Between May 9, 2022 and May 24, 2022, representatives of the Consortium and representatives of Zendesk had
multiple meetings to discuss certain confirmatory due diligence matters, including among other things Zendesk’s
product offering and environment, cybersecurity and risk management, accounting, tax matters, legal matters, HR
matters and financial matters (including business momentum).
Between May 10, 2022 and May 17, 2022, representatives of Bidder 2 and representatives of Zendesk had multiple
meetings to discuss certain confirmatory due diligence matters, including among other things Zendesk’s product
offering and environment, cybersecurity and data privacy, accounting, legal matters, tax matters and financial matters
(including business momentum).
On May 11, 2022, Zendesk circulated a form of merger agreement to the Consortium and Bidder 2, and instructed the
bidders to contact Wachtell Lipton with any questions.
Also on May 11, 2022, representatives of the Consortium and Mr. Svane met to discuss, among other things,
Zendesk’s business and growth opportunities.
On May 13, 2022, at the request of the Consortium, Zendesk agreed to allow two additional financial sponsors to join
the Consortium as additional sources of equity financing (which we refer to respectively as “Financial Sponsor B”
and “Financial Sponsor C”), based on its belief that such partnering would increase the likelihood of an actionable
bid to acquire Zendesk.
Also on May 13, 2022, Zendesk provided an update on its business momentum in April 2022 to the Consortium and
Bidder 2. In April 2022, Zendesk recorded gross bookings of $34.6 million, representing a year-over-year decline of
approximately 7%, which fell below the internal outlook of $42.7 million by 19%, and net bookings of $16.5 million,
representing a year-over-year decline of approximately 13%, which fell below the internal outlook of $20.8 million by
20%. In light of business momentum worsening relative to performance in the first quarter of 2022, both the
Consortium and Bidder 2 requested additional diligence information and management time to better understand
underlying business trends.
Also on May 13, 2022, a representative of the Consortium met with Mr. Svane to discuss the potential transaction
between the Consortium and Zendesk.
On May 16, 2022, to address Bidder 2’s concerns around Zendesk’s business momentum, Mr. Svane met with the
CEO of Bidder 2 to discuss underlying trends driving Zendesk’s then current business momentum and implications
for the long-term financial prospects of Zendesk’s business.
Also on May 16, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent a process letter to each of the Consortium and
Bidder 2, requesting final, binding proposals by May 25, 2022.
At a meeting on May 18, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with Zendesk management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed an update on the strategic review process,
including the diligence process undertaken over the past several weeks by the Consortium and Bidder 2, the status of
the parties’ financing efforts and then current market conditions. The same day, the Consortium spent additional time
with representatives of Zendesk management discussing bookings trends to address concerns around underlying
business momentum.
On May 21, 2022, outside counsel to Bidder 2 submitted a markup of the merger agreement and forms of limited
guaranty and equity commitment letter to representatives of Wachtell Lipton and, on May 23, 2022,
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided preliminary feedback on the merger agreement to Bidder 2’s outside
counsel, including with respect to the regulatory efforts standard reflected in Bidder 2’s markup of the merger
agreement as well as the proposed termination fee to be paid by Bidder 2 to Zendesk in certain circumstances.
On May 23, 2022, representatives of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, counsel to the Consortium, which
we refer to as “Fried Frank,” submitted a markup of the merger agreement and related disclosure schedules to
representatives of Wachtell Lipton which proposed a reverse termination fee equal to 4% of Zendesk’s equity value
payable by the Consortium to Zendesk under certain circumstances and, on May 24, 2022, representatives of
Wachtell Lipton provided preliminary feedback on the merger agreement to representatives of Fried Frank, including
with respect to the regulatory efforts standard reflected in the Consortium’s markup of the merger agreement as well
as the proposed termination fee to be paid by the Consortium to Zendesk in certain circumstances.
On May 24, 2022, representatives of the Consortium contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform them
that Significant LP Co-Investor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C had withdrawn from the bidding
group for a range of reasons, including concerns with the declining business momentum of Zendesk, persistent and
potentially worsening market conditions and volatility as well as the inflated nature of Zendesk’s trading price. As a
result, the Consortium had not yet arranged all the equity financing required to submit a nonbinding proposal and
they inquired whether Qatalyst Partners could partner them with other potential equity financing sources involved in
the strategic review process. They also indicated that, in light of recent declines in the valuations of comparable
companies and deteriorating business momentum of Zendesk, they had lowered the value they believed they might
be prepared to offer to $96.00 per share of Zendesk common stock. On May 24, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk
common stock was $88.18 per share.
On May 25, 2022, representatives of Bidder 2 confirmed that they would not be able to submit a proposal that day but
were continuing to work on a potential proposal. The closing price of Zendesk common stock was $92.19 per share, a
22% decline relative to the closing price on May 5, 2022, the date initial indications of interest were requested. Also,
since October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement of the Momentive Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index
had declined approximately 26%, the IGV ETF had declined approximately 37% and the BVP Emerging Cloud Index
had declined approximately 54%.
On May 26, 2022, representatives of Bidder 2 contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and communicated that
in light of declining valuations of comparable companies, ongoing market uncertainty and deteriorating business
momentum of Zendesk, they would not be able to submit a proposal within or close to their previously indicated
range. They indicated verbally that they may be able to offer as high as $110.00 per share of Zendesk common stock
but would require several additional weeks to secure the necessary equity financing.
Later the same day, Bidder 2 submitted a nonbinding proposal, together with a markup of the merger agreement and
related disclosure schedules, along with forms of limited guaranty, equity commitment letter and debt commitment
letter, to acquire Zendesk for cash at a price of $110.00 per share of Zendesk common stock. The nonbinding proposal
remained subject to the negotiation of definitive transaction documents and additional diligence regarding the
deteriorating business momentum of Zendesk, and Bidder 2 requested an additional 10 business days to finalize
equity commitments.
At a meeting on May 27, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed an update on the strategic
review process, including the challenges both bidders were having securing financing and maintaining valuations in
light of recent market declines and the deteriorating business momentum of Zendesk. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners updated the Board of Directors that representatives of the Consortium had informed representatives of
Qatalyst Partners that the Consortium did not have the equity financing necessary to submit a final proposal to
acquire Zendesk. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then summarized the nonbinding proposal that had been
submitted by Bidder 2, but noted that Bidder 2 had informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it had not yet
arranged all the equity financing required for the nonbinding proposal and had requested an additional 10 business
days to attempt to finalize equity commitments. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs then
discussed Zendesk’s long- and short-term trading performance, hypothetical unaffected stock price, and an updated
financial analysis of Zendesk. The Board of Directors discussed the uncertainty
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
surrounding Bidder 2’s ability to secure equity financing necessary for its proposal and whether a higher price could
be obtained in the then current market. Following further discussion, the Board of Directors agreed to continue
discussion of the nonbinding proposal and the potential response at a meeting the following day.
Also on May 27, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners communicated to representatives of the Consortium that
the Board of Directors would consider any actionable proposal, but until such time (i) would cease to engage with the
Consortium because it had failed to deliver an actionable proposal and (ii) was focused on actionable proposals from
other potential counterparties.
At a meeting on May 28, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton, continued its discussion and review of Bidder 2’s nonbinding proposal to acquire
Zendesk, including the fact that Bidder 2 did not have sufficient equity financing and had requested an additional 10
business days to attempt to secure the necessary equity commitments, and the impact of the strategic review
process, and the related uncertainty, on Zendesk’s operations, management and other employees. Representatives of
Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with the
strategic review process and the Board of Directors’ evaluation of Bidder 2’s nonbinding proposal. Following
discussion, the Board of Directors determined to instruct representatives of Qatalyst Partners to engage with Bidder
2 in an effort to improve on the proposed price to $115.00 per share and to set a timeline to arrange the necessary
equity financing for its proposal and reach a definitive agreement with respect to the proposal.
Also on May 28, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided guidance to Bidder 2 that they would need to
improve their proposed price to $115.00 per share.
On June 1, 2022, representatives of Bidder 2 indicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they were not able
to offer $115.00 per share and suggested that they would only be able to transact somewhere between the then
current share price of Zendesk common stock (the closing price of Zendesk common stock on June 1, 2022 was
$90.12) and $100.00 per share, but that even at that price range, deteriorating market conditions and volatility were
causing the internal processes for limited partners to secure equity commitments to be extended as their internal
committees requested additional work and time for review.
On June 5, 2022, representatives of the Consortium inquired whether Qatalyst Partners could partner them with other
potential equity financing sources involved in the process. No other bidders beyond the Consortium and Bidder 2
remained actively engaged in the process after that point. In response to this request and after receiving approval
from Zendesk, Qatalyst Partners inquired whether Bidder 2 would be willing to consider a partnership with a
consortium of potential financial sponsors involved in the process to acquire Zendesk. Bidder 2 stated that it was
unwilling to do so, citing, among other things, the complexities in any such arrangement.
At a meeting held on June 6, 2022, the Board of Directors discussed, together with members of Zendesk management
and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, the fact that Bidder 2 had
communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that despite its efforts it was not able to secure the financing
required for a bid at $110.00 per share, citing deteriorating business momentum of Zendesk, adverse market
conditions and difficulties in securing financing to fully finance the bid and that the price would need to be in the
range of $90.00 to $100.00 per share for Bidder 2 to be able to transact, and that even at the lower range, Bidder 2
would still need to do additional work to secure the necessary financing. Following discussion, the Board of
Directors considered whether to continue the strategic review process or proceed as a standalone entity. It
considered, among other things, that despite extending the strategic review process to provide interested
counterparties additional time and access to attempt to secure sufficient financing, no actionable proposals had been
submitted, as well as the impact on Zendesk of the prolonged strategic review process and the resulting uncertainty.
The Board of Directors unanimously determined that continuing to execute on Zendesk’s strategic plan as a
standalone public company would be in the best interests of Zendesk and its stockholders at that point in time. The
Board of Directors also unanimously determined that, in light of the disruptive impact of the market rumors on
Zendesk’s business, Zendesk should publicly announce that it had completed a strategic review process and had
determined to remain independent. At a second meeting held later on June 6, 2022, the Board of Directors further
discussed, together with members of Zendesk management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell
Lipton, potential engagement with JANA Partners in light of the potential public announcement of the termination of
the strategic review process. Following discussion, the Board of Directors
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
authorized representatives of Wachtell Lipton to engage with outside counsel for JANA Partners to discuss a
potential limited-duration non-disclosure agreement to allow Zendesk to inform JANA Partners of its intention to
announce that it had conducted and completed a strategic review process that did not produce any actionable offers
and that Zendesk would be scheduling its 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, and to discuss potential settlement
proposals with JANA Partners. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton engaged with outside counsel for JANA Partners
after the meeting.
On June 7, 2022, a representative of JANA Partners’ outside counsel contacted representatives from Wachtell Lipton
to express that JANA Partners was not willing to sign a limited duration non-disclosure agreement for the purpose of
having discussions with Zendesk. On June 8, 2022, JANA Partners issued a press release announcing its intention to
sue Zendesk to compel Zendesk to schedule the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders.
On June 8, 2022, representatives of the Consortium notified representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they continued
to be interested in pursuing an acquisition of Zendesk and that they believed they may be able to secure the
necessary financing if given a few days and subject to completion of confirmatory diligence.
At a meeting later on June 8, 2022, the Board of Directors discussed again, together with members of Zendesk
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, the absence of any
actionable proposals to acquire Zendesk, the possibility that, if given more time, the Consortium or Bidder 2 might
submit an actionable proposal, the difficulties the bidders had experienced in securing financing and maintaining
valuations throughout the process despite the Board of Directors extending the process on multiple occasions, the
impact that publicly terminating the strategic review process may have on Zendesk’s share price and the impact on
Zendesk of the prolonged strategic review process and the continued uncertainty on Zendesk’s business, operations
and employee morale. Following this discussion, the Board of Directors authorized the release of a public
announcement that the Board of Directors had conducted and completed a comprehensive review of strategic
alternatives aimed at enhancing stockholder value, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, and had
determined to remain independent in light of the results of the strategic review process.
Also on June 8, 2022, CNBC reported that Zendesk had terminated the previously rumored sale process. The closing
price of Zendesk common stock declined to $80.52 per share, approximately 7% lower than the closing price on June
7, 2022.
On June 9, 2022, Zendesk issued the contemplated press release, disclosing that Zendesk and its advisors had
solicited interest from a wide range of potential strategic partners and financial sponsors regarding a potential sale of
Zendesk, that no actionable proposals had been submitted and that the Board of Directors had unanimously
determined that continuing to execute on Zendesk’s strategic plan as a standalone public company would be in the
best interests of Zendesk and its stockholders at that time. The press release also announced that Zendesk’s 2022
annual meeting of stockholders would be held on August 17, 2022. The day after the issuance of the press release,
Zendesk’s closing stock price declined to $69.04 per share, approximately 14% lower than the closing price on June 8,
2022.
On June 10, 2022, Zendesk’s closing stock price declined further to $64.97 per share, approximately 6% lower than the
closing price on June 9, 2022.
At a meeting held on June 11, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the commencement of settlement discussions
with JANA Partners to seek to settle JANA Partners’ announced proxy fight. Over the course of the next several
days, members of the Board of Directors and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell Lipton had
discussions with representatives of JANA Partners and their outside counsel with respect to a potential settlement.
On June 13, 2022, Zendesk’s closing stock price declined further to $59.96 per share, approximately 8% lower than the
closing price on June 10, 2022.
On June 14, 2022, representatives of the Consortium contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express
renewed interest in submitting a proposal to acquire Zendesk, subject to receipt of additional due diligence, including
on actual results for gross and net bookings for May 2022 and an update on Zendesk’s overall business momentum.
That same day, a representative of the Consortium verbally indicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that he
believed such proposal could be as high as $82.00 per share, if actual
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
results for May 2022 were in line with their expectations and subject to satisfactory responses to certain other
confirmatory due diligence items. Following the outreach from the Consortium, representatives of Qatalyst Partners
reached out to Bidder 2 to inquire whether it had any interest in a renewed bid for Zendesk. Bidder 2 stated that it
would also need to understand actual results for gross and net bookings for May 2022 and receive an update on
Zendesk’s overall business momentum, and that it would need to see improvement in these trends relative to the prior
months to support the submission of a proposal. On June 14, 2022, Zendesk’s share price declined further to $57.04
per share, approximately 5% lower than the closing price on June 13, 2022.
On June 15, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided actual gross and net bookings for May 2022, which
indicated weaker business momentum than in prior months, as well as an updated view of expected gross and net
bookings for June 2022, to representatives of the Consortium and representatives of Bidder 2. In May 2022, Zendesk
recorded gross bookings of $35.7 million, representing a year-over-year decline of approximately 16%, which fell
below the internal outlook of $51.6 million by 31%, and net bookings of $16.8 million, representing a year-over-year
decline of approximately 36%, which fell below the internal outlook of $32.2 million by 48%.
Later, at a meeting on June 15, 2022, the Board of Directors discussed, together with members of Zendesk
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell Lipton, the outreach by representatives of the
Consortium and the expectation that the Consortium would be submitting a revised proposal to acquire Zendesk.
Members of Zendesk management discussed the then current economic environment and financial forecast,
including the negative trends in gross and net bookings being experienced by Zendesk. The Board of Directors also
discussed with members of Zendesk management and the advisors the potential terms of a settlement with JANA
Partners.
On June 16, 2022, Zendesk’s share price declined further to $54.53 per share, approximately 4% lower than the closing
price on June 14, 2022.
On June 17, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners received a nonbinding proposal from the Consortium offering
to acquire 100% of the common stock of Zendesk for a price of $75.50 per share, subject to limited confirmatory due
diligence and the negotiation of definitive transaction documents, along with an updated markup of the draft merger
agreement and disclosure schedules (which we refer to as the “June 17 Proposal”). The draft merger agreement,
reflected, among other things, a proposed reverse termination fee equal to 4% of Zendesk’s equity value payable by
the Consortium to Zendesk under certain circumstances (consistent with the draft of the merger agreement submitted
by Fried Frank on May 23, 2022). Along with the June 17 Proposal, the Consortium submitted a markup of the related
disclosure schedules, executed debt and preferred equity commitment letters and forms of equity commitment letters
and fee funding agreements. As part of the June 17 Proposal, the Consortium informed Zendesk that Significant LP
Co-Investor B and Significant LP Co-Investor C would be increasing their commitments and investing alongside the
Consortium. During a conversation with representatives of the Consortium, such representatives indicated that they
had lowered the price at which they were willing to transact in light of the actual gross and net bookings results for
May 2022, which were weaker than they had expected, and the continued deterioration in business momentum at
Zendesk. On June 17, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk common stock was $55.87 per share, approximately 30%
lower than the closing price on June 8, 2022 (since October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement of the Momentive
Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 31%, the IGV ETF had declined
approximately 40%, the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 56% and the Zendesk share price had
declined approximately 53%).
Following receipt of the June 17 Proposal and after consultation with members of the Board of Directors,
representatives of Zendesk proposed a limited duration confidentiality agreement with JANA Partners to disclose to
JANA Partners the June 17 Proposal in the context of settlement discussions with JANA Partners. JANA Partners
agreed to enter into a limited duration confidentiality agreement on June 18, 2022.
On the morning of June 19, 2022, Mr. Bass and a representative of Wachtell Lipton met with representatives from
JANA Partners, to discuss the June 17 Proposal pursuant to the confidentiality agreement entered into between
Zendesk and JANA Partners. The representatives of JANA Partners expressed support for Zendesk being open to
the proposed transaction and attempting to engage with the Consortium in an effort to see if it were possible to
improve on the proposed price.
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
At a meeting later on June 19, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with representatives of Qatalyst Partners,
Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, discussed and reviewed the status of settlement discussions with JANA
Partners and Mr. Bass’s conversation with representatives of JANA Partners, as well as the June 17 Proposal as
compared to continuing to operate Zendesk on a standalone basis. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners summarized
the terms and conditions of the June 17 Proposal, discussing with the Board of Directors the key assumptions
underlying the indicative valuations included in the June 17 Proposal, proposed financing plans as well as the
confirmatory diligence requests made by the Consortium. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wachtell Lipton
also provided the Board of Directors with a potential timeline for a transaction with the Consortium, should the Board
of Directors determine to consider the June 17 Proposal. Members of Zendesk management discussed with the Board
of Directors the work that Zendesk management had commenced to update Zendesk’s long-range plan to account for
the significant changes in economic conditions and negative trends in gross and net bookings for Zendesk and
deterioration in business momentum that deviated materially from the assumptions underlying the March 2022 Case.
Following discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to
engage with the Consortium in an effort to improve on the proposed price and authorized representatives of Wachtell
Lipton, working with Zendesk management, to proceed with negotiating definitive transaction documents with the
Consortium with respect to a potential transaction.
Between June 17, 2022, and June 23, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners had multiple conversations with
representatives of Bidder 2 regarding whether they had secured the necessary equity financing and whether they
planned to submit a proposal to acquire Zendesk. The conclusion of these conversations was that, in light of
ongoing concerns around business momentum, Bidder 2 would not be prepared to submit a proposal without seeing
actual gross and net bookings data for June 2022 and assurances that business momentum was improving.
On June 20, 2022, Mr. Svane and Mr. John Geschke, the Chief of Staff of Zendesk, met with representatives of the
Consortium to discuss negative trends in gross and net bookings for May 2022, business momentum trends and
forecasts for the second quarter of 2022 as well as possible adjustments to Zendesk’s cost structure to reflect
changes in the macroeconomic outlook and business momentum.
Following several discussions among representatives of Qatalyst Partners and the Consortium, on June 21, 2022, the
Consortium submitted a “best and final” proposal to acquire 100% of the common stock of Zendesk for a price of
$77.50 per share, subject to limited confirmatory due diligence and the negotiation of definitive transaction
documents (which we refer to as the “June 21 Proposal”). Along with the June 21 Proposal, the Consortium submitted
executed debt and preferred equity commitment letters as well as forms of equity commitment letters and fee funding
agreements. Following the receipt of the June 21 Proposal, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to Bidder
2 again to inquire whether there was any interest in a renewed bid for Zendesk, and Bidder 2 re-confirmed that it was
not willing to submit a proposal, again citing concerns over the negative business momentum of Zendesk and
challenges relating to the overall economic environment, among other factors. On June 21, 2022, the closing price of
Zendesk common stock was $56.04 per share (since October 28, 2021, the date of the announcement of the
Momentive Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 28%, the IGV ETF had declined
approximately 39%, the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 55% and the Zendesk share price had
declined approximately 53%).
On June 21, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Fried Frank a revised draft of the merger
agreement, and thereafter the parties continued to exchange drafts of the merger agreement and the ancillary
agreements through their respective legal advisors, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Fried Frank
continued to discuss the open issues in these agreements, including issues relating to the amount of the termination
fee payable by the Consortium to Zendesk in certain circumstances, the treatment of equity awards and other
employee matters, restrictions on the operations of Zendesk between signing and closing and the remedies available
to the parties (including the right to specific performance and damages in certain circumstances).
On June 21 and 22, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke further with representatives of JANA Partners to
apprise them of developments with respect to the proposed transaction, including the June 21 Proposal, and to
understand JANA Partners’ perspectives, including the Consortium having indicated its updated
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
proposed price was “best and final” and Bidder 2 having indicated it would not be submitting a bid. Representatives
of JANA Partners indicated that JANA Partners would not oppose a transaction at $77.50 per share and indicated
that it would expect to terminate its proxy contest upon an announcement of such a transaction.
On June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting, together with members of Zendesk management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, to discuss the status of negotiations with
the Consortium. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated the Board of Directors on discussions with
representatives of the Consortium, noting that representatives of the Consortium had reiterated to representatives of
Qatalyst Partners that $77.50 was their “best and final” offer. Members of Zendesk management also presented an
updated operating plan for Zendesk for the year ending December 31, 2022, along with an updated 2031 long-range
plan for Zendesk (which we define as the “June 2022 Case” in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Certain
Financial Projections”) in light of the changes in the internal and external business environment, including below-
expectation actual gross and net bookings for the months of April and May 2022, challenges to Zendesk’s
performance resulting from elevated levels of attrition in critical sales functions and employee distraction as well as
significant changes in economic conditions facing Zendesk and its industry more generally, including increased risk
of recession, persistent high inflation and the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on Zendesk’s customer segments.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board of Directors their financial
analyses with respect to Zendesk based on Zendesk management’s projections. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton
then provided the Board of Directors with an overview of the material open issues in the draft merger agreement and
financing documents, including the acquiror termination fee of approximately 4% of Zendesk’s equity value proposed
by the Consortium, the regulatory approvals that would be required in connection with a transaction and the
obligations of the parties in the draft transaction documents related to such regulatory efforts. Following discussion,
the Board of Directors authorized the advisors to move forward to seek to finalize proposed definitive agreements for
a transaction at the $77.50 per share cash price.
On June 23, 2022, representatives of Fried Frank sent representatives of Wachtell Lipton a revised draft of the merger
agreement which proposed, among other things, a reverse termination fee payable to Zendesk under certain
circumstances of approximately 5% of Zendesk’s equity value (an increase of 1% from the prior draft of merger
agreement submitted by the Consortium).
Thereafter, on June 23, 2022, representatives of Fried Frank and representatives of Wachtell Lipton met via
conference call to discuss the draft of merger agreement submitted by representatives of Fried Frank to
representatives of Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Fried Frank noted to representatives of Wachtell Lipton that a
reverse termination fee of approximately 6% of Zendesk’s equity value payable by the Consortium under certain
circumstances would be acceptable to the Consortium if Zendesk accepted the Consortium’s proposals on certain
other matters. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton indicated that this proposal may be acceptable to Zendesk.
On June 23, 2022, the Board of Directors, together with members of Zendesk management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, held a meeting to discuss and consider whether to approve
entry into definitive transaction documents providing for a merger of Zendesk with and into an affiliate of the
Consortium. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under
Delaware law in connection with a potential sale of Zendesk. Members of Zendesk management discussed the June
2022 Case that had been previously provided to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved its use
by Zendesk’s financial advisors in connection with their analyses of the potential transaction. Representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs reviewed and discussed their respective financial analyses regarding the
proposed Merger Consideration of $77.50 per share in cash. Thereafter, at the request of the Board of Directors,
representatives of Qatalyst Partners rendered Qatalyst Partners’ oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion, to the Board of Directors that, as of the date of such opinion, based upon and subject
to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration
to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of
Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP.”
Representatives of Goldman Sachs, at the request of the Board of Directors, then rendered Goldman Sachs’ oral
opinion to the
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board of Directors, subsequently confirmed in writing on June 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of June 24, 2022, and
based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the
$77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of
such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders as further
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.”
On June 23, 2022, the closing price of Zendesk common stock was $57.95 per share (since October 28, 2021, the date
of the announcement of the Momentive Transaction, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately
27%, the IGV ETF had declined approximately 36%, the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 52%
and the Zendesk share price had declined approximately 51%).
Representatives of Wachtell Lipton then summarized the terms of the proposed merger agreement and financing
documents compared to the terms previously reviewed, including a reverse termination fee of approximately 6% of
Zendesk’s equity value payable by the Consortium under certain circumstances, the regulatory approvals that would
be required in connection with the transaction and the obligations of the parties in the proposed transaction
documents related to such regulatory efforts. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also provided a summary of a
proposed retention equity award and severance program to promote the retention of certain key employees during
the pendency of a transaction. Following discussion, the members of the Board of Directors and the compensation
committee of the Board of Directors approved the proposed compensation arrangements. After discussion, the Board
of Directors directed representatives of Wachtell Lipton to discuss with JANA Partners the potential imminent entry
by Zendesk into definitive agreements with respect to a sale of Zendesk and determine whether JANA Partners
would be prepared to enter into an agreement to withdraw its nominations. The Board of Directors recessed the
meeting and representatives of Wachtell Lipton contacted counsel for JANA Partners, who expressed JANA
Partners’ willingness to agree to withdraw its director nomination notice effective as of 5:00 p.m. on June 24, 2022 if
Zendesk were to announce an agreement for a sale of Zendesk at the $77.50 per share cash price no later than the
opening of market on June 24, 2022.
Thereafter, on June 23, 2022, the Board of Directors reconvened. Following further discussion and deliberation,
including taking into account the factors described below in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “-Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” the Board of Directors
unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair
to and in the best interests of Zendesk and its stockholders; (b) approved the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement; (c)
resolved to recommend that Zendesk stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement; and (d) directed that the adoption
of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by Zendesk stockholders at the Special Meeting.
Following the meeting of the Board of Directors, representatives of the parties executed the Merger Agreement and
the other transaction documents early on June 24, 2022. Before the opening of market on June 24, 2022, the parties
issued a press release announcing the transaction.

40TABLE OF CONTENTS
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger, the Board of Directors consulted with independent legal and financial advisors, as well as
Zendesk management, and considered a number of factors that supported its decision to approve the Merger
Agreement and the Merger (not necessarily in order of relative importance), including the following:
•
Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger
Consideration is all cash, which provides Zendesk stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity
for their shares of Zendesk common stock and enables Zendesk stockholders to realize value that has been
created by Zendesk and does not expose them to any future risks related to the business or the financial
markets generally, as compared to Zendesk remaining independent (especially when viewed against the
potential risks and uncertainties inherent in Zendesk’s business, including risks related to changing
external and internal business factors, including a challenging macroeconomic environment and related
impacts on key customer segments). Specifically, among other things, the Board of Directors considered:
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium value for Zendesk stockholders,
including a 34% premium over the closing price of Zendesk common stock as of June 23, 2022, the last
trading day before the public announcement of the Merger;
•
the trading price of Zendesk common stock since its initial public offering, including the trading price
subsequent to the public announcement of the termination of the strategic review process on June 9,
2022, and the Merger Consideration relative to such prices;
•
the belief that the Merger Consideration represents the highest price that the Consortium was willing
to pay considering the negotiations between the parties; and
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration is fixed and that the Merger Consideration will not fluctuate
based upon changes in the market price of Zendesk’s publicly traded shares.
•
Value Relative to Standalone Prospects of Zendesk. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the
Merger Consideration compares favorably to the potential value of Zendesk and Zendesk common stock if
Zendesk were to remain as a standalone entity after taking into account the significant risks and
uncertainties associated with this alternative, in light of a number of factors, including:
•
Zendesk’s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and historical and projected
financial performance, taking into account negative trends in gross and net bookings momentum, as
well as the risk that such trends could persist or worsen, including below expectation gross and net
bookings actuals for:
•
the first quarter of 2022: actual gross bookings of $136.0 million, which represented year-over-
year growth of approximately 6% and fell below the internal outlook of $159.3 million by 15%, and
net bookings of $86.6 million, which represented year-over-year growth of approximately 4% and
fell below the internal outlook of $104.3 million by 17%;
•
the month of April 2022: actual gross bookings of $34.6 million, which represented a year-over-
year decline of 7% and fell below the internal outlook of $42.7 million by 19%, and net bookings
of $16.5 million, which represented a year-over-year decline of approximately 13% and fell below
the internal outlook of $20.8 million by 20%; and
•
the month of May 2022: actual gross bookings of $35.7 million, which represented a year-over-
year decline of approximately 16% and fell below the internal outlook of $51.6 million by 31%, and
net bookings of $16.8 million, which represented a year-over-year decline of approximately 36%
and fell below the internal outlook of $32.2 million by 48%.
•
as a result of the then current business momentum and recessionary concerns, management
expectations for fiscal year 2023 revenue based on the June 2022 Case versus the March 2022 Case
decreased approximately 10% from $2,172 million to $1,961 million, implying a decline in expected year-
over-year growth from approximately 27% to approximately 17%, and management expectations for the
third quarter, fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 revenues are below street expectations as of June 23,
2022 by approximately 2%, 4% and 7%, respectively;

•
significant compression in valuations of publicly-traded SaaS companies between the announcement
of the Momentive Transaction on October 28, 2021 and June 23, 2022 (between October 28, 2021 and
June 23, 2022, the NASDAQ Composite Index had declined approximately 27%, the IGV ETF had
declined approximately 36%, the BVP Emerging Cloud Index had declined approximately 52% and the
share price of Zendesk common stock had declined approximately 51%);
•
a belief, based on analysis of historical valuation trends, that elevated valuation multiples for publicly-
traded SaaS companies over the previous two years were extraordinary and that the recent
compression in multiples for the industry could be long-standing;
•
the belief that, prior to the public announcement of the termination of the strategic review process on
June 9, 2022, shares of Zendesk common stock were trading on an “affected basis” and reflected a
premium driven by takeover speculation and that the share price following the public announcement
more accurately reflected the fundamental value of Zendesk common stock;
•
recent market volatility related to the evolving macroeconomic headwinds facing Zendesk and its
industry more generally, including increased risk of recession, persistent high inflation and the impact
of changed economic circumstances on key customer segments;
•
the strategic alternatives reasonably available to Zendesk on a standalone basis, and the risks and
uncertainties associated with those alternatives;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to Zendesk’s efforts to develop and market new products;
•
the risks and uncertainties related to increased competition in the markets in which Zendesk competes
or may compete in the future; and
•
the possibility that Zendesk’s competitors may be more successful in attracting talent and resources
and the negative result that such competitive pressure may have on the ability of Zendesk to execute
on its core business objectives, including as evidenced by elevated levels of attrition in Zendesk’s
critical sales function and the resulting negative impact on execution.
•
The Sale Process. The Board of Directors also considered:
•
that an extensive review of strategic alternatives was conducted and that Zendesk, with the assistance
of Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs, actively solicited interest in potential transactions from both
strategic and financial sponsors, including with those parties that were believed to be the most able
and willing to transact, as more fully described above in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-
Background of the Merger”;
•
that of the 26 potential bidders (including and counting the members of the Consortium and their
potential co-investors as one bidder) contacted, 11 bidders (including and counting the members of
the Consortium and their potential co-investors as one bidder) entered into non-disclosure
agreements with Zendesk, and 10 of these 11 bidders (including and counting the members of the
Consortium and their potential co-investors as one bidder) attended initial meetings with
representatives of Zendesk management and were granted due diligence access to Zendesk;
•
that only two of the potential bidders (including and counting the members of the Consortium and
their potential co-investors as one bidder) that engaged in discussions regarding a potential
acquisition of Zendesk submitted an indication of interest with regard to the acquisition of Zendesk
and that only the Consortium submitted a definitive proposal;
•
the fact that the strategic review process, even after media coverage regarding Zendesk’s discussions
with potentially interested parties, did not result in any proposals to acquire Zendesk that the Board
of Directors believed were more likely to create greater value and certainty of value for the Zendesk
stockholders than the Merger; and
•
the Consortium’s indication to the Board of Directors that the Merger Consideration of $77.50 per
share was the highest price they were willing to offer, and that such offer had been increased
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
because of the negotiating efforts of the Board of Directors and Zendesk’s advisors, and the Board of
Directors’ belief, after discussion with its advisors and based on the course of negotiations with the
Consortium, that $77.50 per share was the maximum price that the Consortium would offer.
•
Negotiation Process. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement
were informed by the advice and professional experience of Zendesk’s advisors and the result of robust
negotiations.
•
Stockholder Feedback. The Board of Directors considered the feedback from JANA Partners and other
significant Zendesk stockholders received in engagements during the course of the strategic review
process. Feedback from significant Zendesk stockholders indicated a preference that Zendesk pursue a
sale process and, to the extent a comprehensive process was completed, provide Zendesk stockholders
with the opportunity to make a decision regarding any actionable proposals received.
•
Opinion of Financial Advisors. The Board of Directors considered the oral opinion of (a) Qatalyst Partners,
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Board of Directors that, as of the date of such opinion, based
upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein,
the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger
Agreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent)
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as further described in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP,” and the full text of the opinion, which is attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety and
(b) Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, dated June 24, 2022, to the
effect that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the various factors,
assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the $77.50 in cash per share of
Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares
pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders as further
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,” and the
full text of the opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors considered the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, including:
•
the provision allowing the Board of Directors to change its recommendation prior to obtaining
stockholder approval of the Merger in specified circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or
Intervening Event, subject to Parent’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment
of the termination fee of $254 million;
•
the provision allowing the Board of Directors to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a
Superior Proposal, subject to certain conditions (including payment of the termination fee of $254
million and certain rights of Parent to match the Superior Proposal);
•
the Board of Directors’ belief, after discussion with Zendesk’s advisors, that the $254 million
termination fee, which constitutes approximately 2.5% of Zendesk’s equity value in the Merger, would
not preclude a Superior Proposal from being made;
•
Parent having obtained committed debt and preferred equity financing from reputable financial
institutions and committed equity financing from affiliated funds of the members of the Consortium in
an aggregate amount, together with Zendesk’s cash on hand, sufficient to fund the required amounts;
•
the provision obligating Parent to use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing and Equity Financing on
terms (subject to certain exceptions) and conditions described in the commitment letters;
•
the termination fee of $610 million that may be owed by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement
under certain circumstances, and the fact that affiliates of the members of the Consortium provided fee
funding agreements with respect to their portion of the payment of such termination fee, as
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
well as certain associated enforcement costs and certain other reimbursement obligations that may be
owed by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement and the Fee Funding Agreements;
•
the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, including the limited number and nature of the
conditions to complete the Merger (including regulatory conditions), and the provisions of the
Merger Agreement requiring Parent to use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all
actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable under the Merger
Agreement and applicable law to obtain as expeditiously as possible all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be
obtained from any third party or any governmental entity to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and
•
the availability of statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the Merger.
•
Opportunity for Zendesk Stockholders to Vote. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger
would be subject to the approval of Zendesk stockholders, and Zendesk stockholders would be free to
evaluate the Merger and vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.
•
Timing of Completion. The Board of Directors considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of
the Merger and concluded that the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly
manner. The Board of Directors also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable
timeframe could reduce the period during which Zendesk’s business would be subject to the potential
uncertainty of closing and related disruption.
•
Operating Flexibility. The fact that the Merger Agreement provides Zendesk sufficient operating flexibility
to conduct its business in the ordinary course until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger and the
termination of the Merger Agreement (as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement-Conduct of
Business Pending the Merger”).
•
Specific Performance. Zendesk’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek
specific performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent
other breaches of the Merger Agreement.
In the course of their deliberations, the Board of Directors also considered certain risks and other potentially negative
factors concerning the Merger, including:
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Board of Directors considered the fact
that the nature of the Merger as an all-cash transaction means that Zendesk would no longer exist as an
independent public company following the consummation of the Merger and that Zendesk stockholders
will not participate in future earnings or growth of Parent and will not benefit from any appreciation in value
of the Surviving Corporation.
•
Closing Conditions and Financing. The Board of Directors considered the fact that there can be no
assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if
the Merger Agreement is adopted by Zendesk stockholders, as well as the risk that the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters will not be obtained, resulting in Parent and Merger Sub not
having sufficient funds to complete the Merger, or that Parent and Merger Sub may otherwise not obtain
sufficient funds to complete the Merger.
•
Risks Associated with Parent and Merger Sub. The Board of Directors considered the fact that Parent and
Merger Sub are newly formed entities with essentially no assets and the Fee Funding Agreements,
provided by each of the Equity Financing Sources, guarantees Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations
under the Merger Agreement only with respect to payment of the termination fee of $610 million payable by
Parent, certain associated enforcement costs and certain other indemnification and reimbursement
obligations.
•
Interim Operating Risks. The Board of Directors considered the restrictions placed on the conduct of
Zendesk’s business prior to the completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agreement, which, despite providing sufficient flexibility for Zendesk to operate its business in the
ordinary course, could delay or prevent Zendesk from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or
any other action it would otherwise take with respect to the operations of Zendesk absent the pending
completion of the Merger.
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board of Directors considered the
possibility that the Merger might not be consummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:
•
Zendesk’s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and
effort and will have experienced significant distraction from their work during the pendency of the
Merger;
•
Zendesk will have incurred significant transaction costs;
•
Zendesk’s continuing business relationships with customers, vendors, partners and employees may
be adversely affected;
•
the trading price of shares of Zendesk common stock could be materially and adversely affected;
•
the market’s perceptions of Zendesk’s prospects could be adversely affected; and
•
Zendesk could lose key management or other personnel of Zendesk during the pendency of the
Merger.
•
No Solicitation and Termination Fee. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger
Agreement precludes Zendesk from soliciting or, subject to certain limited exceptions, considering
Alternative Proposals and requires Zendesk to pay Parent a termination fee of $254 million in certain
circumstances.
•
Remedies. The Board of Directors considered the fact that Zendesk’s remedies in the event that the Merger
Agreement is terminated may be limited to the Parent Termination Fee of $610 million, payable by Parent
under certain circumstances and certain associated enforcement costs and certain other reimbursement
obligations, which may be inadequate to compensate Zendesk for any damage caused. In addition, the
Board of Directors considered that such termination fee may not be available in all instances where the
Merger is not consummated and, even if available, rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to
enforce, and the success of any such action may be uncertain.
•
Effects of Transaction Announcement. The Board of Directors considered the potential effects of the public
announcement of the Merger Agreement, including potential effects on Zendesk’s ability to attract and
retain key personnel during the pendency of the Merger, as well as the potential for legal proceedings,
judgments or settlements following the announcement of the Merger and the associated costs, burden and
inconvenience involved in defending those proceedings, judgments and settlements.
•
Timing Risks. The Board of Directors considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger,
including that completion of the Merger depends on factors outside of Zendesk’s or the Consortium’s
control (including the approval of the Merger by Zendesk stockholders and certain governmental
authorities), and the risk that the pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the
announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement could divert Zendesk management’s attention
and have an adverse impact on Zendesk, including its client and other business relationships.
•
Taxable Consideration. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the exchange of Zendesk common
stock for cash in the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•
Other Risks. The Board of Directors considered the other risks described in and incorporated by reference
in this proxy statement, see “Risk Factors” in Zendesk’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2021, as amended, incorporated by reference herein and the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board of Directors concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger
were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger.
In addition to considering the factors described above, the Board of Directors also considered that some of
Zendesk’s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Zendesk stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of these interests and considered them at the time
it approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to Zendesk stockholders. For more information,
please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Interests of Zendesk’s Executive Officers and Directors in the
Merger.” The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not
intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material positive and negative factors considered by the Board of
Directors. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the complexity of
these matters, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual
directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board of Directors did not undertake to make any
specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or
did not support its ultimate determination. The Board of Directors based its unanimous recommendation on the
totality of the information presented, including the factors described above. This explanation of the reasoning of the
Board of Directors and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read
in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP
Zendesk retained Qatalyst Partners to act as one of its financial advisors in connection with a potential transaction
such as the Merger and to evaluate whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or
any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Zendesk selected Qatalyst Partners to
act as Zendesk’s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of
the business and affairs of Zendesk and the industry in which it operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written
consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the Board of Directors on June
23, 2022, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to
the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications,
limitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than
Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Qatalyst Partners delivered
its written opinion, dated June 23, 2022, to the Board of Directors following the meeting of the Board of Directors.
The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated June 23, 2022, is attached hereto as Annex B and is
incorporated by reference herein. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in
rendering its opinion. The holders of Zendesk common stock should read the opinion carefully in its entirety.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the Board of Directors and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion,
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other
than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the Merger. It
does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Zendesk common stock should vote with
respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Zendesk common
stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, certain related documents and
certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Zendesk. Qatalyst
Partners also reviewed the June 2022 Case prepared by Zendesk management, described in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “-Certain Financial Projections.” Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current
operations and financial condition and the prospects of Zendesk with senior
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
management of Zendesk. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Zendesk
common stock and compared the financial performance of Zendesk and the prices and trading activity of Zendesk
common stock with that of certain other selected publicly traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst
Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Qatalyst
Partners deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or
discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Zendesk. With respect to the June 2022 Case, Qatalyst Partners was advised by
Zendesk management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on discussions with Zendesk management and the
Board of Directors, that the June 2022 Case had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of Zendesk management of the future financial performance of Zendesk and other
matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the terms of the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by
Qatalyst Partners would not differ materially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or
delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the
Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on
Zendesk or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the Merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Zendesk or its affiliates,
nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied,
without independent verification, upon the assessment of Zendesk management as to the existing and future
technology and products of Zendesk and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners’
opinion has been approved by its opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion
may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners has not
assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion does not address the
underlying business decision of Zendesk to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to
any strategic alternatives that may be available to Zendesk. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is limited to the fairness, from
a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of
Parent), and Qatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of Zendesk or any of its affiliates, or any class of such
persons, relative to such consideration.
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its
opinion dated June 23, 2022. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering
any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners
utilized, among other things, the June 2022 Case, described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Certain
Financial Projections.” Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular
format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used
by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set
forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies
and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners’
financial analyses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of
potential per-share present values for Zendesk common stock as of March 31, 2022 (which is the end of Zendesk’s
most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet date) by:
•
adding:
•
the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows excluding the impact of
stock-based compensation (which are referred to as the “UFCF”) of Zendesk, based on the June 2022
Case for the second quarter of calendar year 2022 through calendar year 2026 (which implied present
value was calculated using a range of discount rates of 9.5% to 13.0%, based on an estimated
weighted average cost of capital for Zendesk);
•
the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Zendesk, calculated by multiplying
Zendesk’s estimated UFCF excluding the impact of stock-based compensation in calendar year 2027 of
approximately $815 million, based on the June 2022 Case, by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to
next-twelve-months’ estimated UFCF multiples of 16.0x to 25.0x (which were chosen based on Qatalyst
Partners’ professional judgment and experience), and discounted to present value using the same
range of discount rates used in the first bullet above;
•
the cash and cash equivalents of Zendesk as of March 31, 2022, as provided by Zendesk
management;
•
the implied net present value of estimated federal tax savings due to its net operating losses and
research and development tax credits for calendar years 2028 and beyond, discounted to present value
using the same range of discount rates used in the first bullet above; and
•
subtracting:
•
the face value of Zendesk’s outstanding convertible debt as of March 31, 2022, as provided by
Zendesk management; and
•
dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Zendesk common stock outstanding
(calculated using the treasury stock method and excluding approximately 371,000 restricted stock units to
be issued under Zendesk’s proposed $28.75 million retention pool), adjusted for restricted stock units,
performance stock units, stock options and in-the-money convertible notes (calculated using the net share
settlement method and excluding any make-whole shares or other change of control adjustments), all as
provided by Zendesk management as of June 22, 2022, with each of the above-referenced estimated future
UFCFs, terminal value and federal tax savings due to net operating losses and research and development
tax credits for calendar years 2028 and beyond having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated
dilution to current stockholders through each respective applicable period (which totaled approximately
21% in the case of the terminal value) due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations
related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Zendesk
management.
Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for Zendesk common stock of
approximately $58.27 to $96.42 per share.
Selected Companies Analysis
Qatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for Zendesk with
publicly available financial information and public market multiples for selected companies. The companies used in
this comparison were those companies listed below, which were selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional
judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of business to Zendesk,
have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have other relevant or similar characteristics.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates as of June 23, 2022 and using the closing prices as of
June 23, 2022 for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the fully-diluted
enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus revenue for calendar year 2023 (which are referred to as the
“CY2023E revenue multiples”), for each of the selected companies, as shown below:

Based on an analysis of the CY2023E revenue multiples for the selected companies and the application of its
professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 3.0x to 6.0x.
Qatalyst Partners then applied this range to Zendesk’s estimated revenue for calendar year 2023, based on the June
2022 Case. Based on the fully diluted shares of Zendesk common stock outstanding as of June 22, 2022 (calculated
utilizing the same methodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement entitled “-Discounted Cash Flow
Analysis”), this analysis implied a range of values for Zendesk common stock of approximately $47.29 to $91.92 per
share.
No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Zendesk. In evaluating the selected
companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control
of Zendesk, such as the impact of competition on Zendesk’s business and the industry in general, industry growth
and the absence of any material adverse change in Zendesk’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in
the financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic
mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Qatalyst Partners compared forty selected public company transactions, including transactions involving companies
participating in similar lines of business to Zendesk or with similar business models, similar financial performance or
other relevant or similar characteristics.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (a) the implied
fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of last-twelve-months’ revenue of the target
company (which are referred to as the “LTM revenue multiples”) and (b) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of
the target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-months’
revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the “NTM revenue multiples”).

Based on the total consideration payable by Thoma Bravo, L.P. for Anaplan, Inc. as of June 2022.
Based on the analysis of the LTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment,
Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 6.3x to 13.2x then applied this range to Zendesk’s last-
twelve months’ revenue (calculated as the four quarters ended on March 31, 2022). Based on the fully diluted shares
of Zendesk common stock outstanding as of June 22, 2022 (calculated utilizing the same
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
methodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement entitled “-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” with
the exception of assuming cash settlement of the convertible notes with an assumed make-whole adjustment and
cash settlement of the capped calls based on a Black-Scholes option calculation model, each based on an assumed
September 30, 2022 closing date for the Merger), as provided by Zendesk management, this analysis implied a range
of values for Zendesk common stock of approximately $71.56 to $142.65 per share.
Based on the analysis of the NTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment,
Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 5.3x to 10.9x then applied this range to Zendesk’s
estimated next-twelve-months’ revenue (calculated as the four quarters ending on March 31, 2023) based on the June
2022 Case. Based on the same fully diluted share count as used in the immediately preceding paragraph, this analysis
implied a range of values for Zendesk common stock of approximately $73.58 to $144.03 per share.
No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Zendesk or the Merger. In
evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond Zendesk’s control, such as the impact of competition on Zendesk’s business or the industry generally,
industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in Zendesk’s financial condition and prospects or
the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and
the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical
analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of
using selected transactional data. Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger,
Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.
Miscellaneous
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of
financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses,
without considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying
its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and factors more or less
weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not
be taken to be Qatalyst Partners’ view of the actual value of Zendesk. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners
made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Zendesk. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst
Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of
Parent), to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price at which Zendesk
common stock might actually trade at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors considered by the
Board of Directors in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above
should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board of Directors with respect to the Merger
Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders
of shares of Zendesk common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) or of whether the Board of Directors
would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. The Merger Consideration payable in the Merger was
determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Zendesk and Parent and was approved by the Board of
Directors. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Zendesk during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not,
however, recommend any specific consideration to Zendesk or that any specific consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the Merger.
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,
domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these
activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise
effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Zendesk, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.
During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, no material relationship existed between
Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and Zendesk or any member of the Consortium (Permira, H&F, Significant LP
Co-Investor B and Significant LP Co-Investor C) or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst
Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners has provided financial advisory services to Permira and received a fee of
$15 million in connection with such services. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide
investment banking and other financial services to Zendesk or Parent and their respective affiliates for which
Qatalyst Partners would expect to receive compensation.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided Zendesk with financial advisory services in
connection with the Merger for which it will be paid an aggregate amount currently estimated at approximately $56
million, $250,000 of which was payable upon the execution of the engagement letter, $5 million of which was
payable upon delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), $2 million of which was
payable upon the resolution of the proxy contest with JANA Partners, and the remaining portion of which will be
paid upon, and subject to, the closing of the Merger. Zendesk has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its
expenses incurred in performing its services. Zendesk has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its
affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person controlling
Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws, and certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners’ engagement.
Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
At the meeting of the Board of Directors on June 23, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Board of
Directors, subsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, dated June 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of the
date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth
therein, the $77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its
affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated June 24, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion contained in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs
provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors in connection
with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of
shares of Zendesk common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman
Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the Merger Agreement;
•
the annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Zendesk for the five fiscal years
ended December 31, 2021;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Zendesk;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Zendesk;
•
certain other communications from Zendesk to its stockholders; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Zendesk (which forecasts are referred to as the June
2022 Case and summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Certain Financial Projections”)
(including a schedule of expected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards by Zendesk) prepared by
Zendesk management, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Zendesk, which we refer to as the
“Forecasts” in this section of this proxy statement.
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Zendesk regarding their
assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Zendesk;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for Zendesk common stock; compared certain financial and stock
market information for Zendesk with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are
publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the software industry and in
other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as Goldman
Sachs deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Board of Directors, relied upon and
assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information
provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Board of Directors that the
Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of Zendesk
management. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities
(including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Zendesk or any of its
subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed
that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger
would be obtained without any adverse effect on Zendesk or on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way
meaningful to Goldman Sachs’ analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger would be consummated on the
terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of
which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Zendesk to engage in the Merger, or
the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Zendesk; nor does
it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addressed only the fairness from a
financial point of view, as of the date of its written opinion, of the $77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock
to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger
Agreement or the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of Zendesk; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable
to any of the officers, directors or employees of Zendesk, or any class of such persons in connection with the
Merger, whether relative to the $77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders of such
shares (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion
was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of the written opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for
updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date
of its written opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of
Zendesk common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock
markets on Zendesk, Parent or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Zendesk
or Parent or the ability of Zendesk or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’
opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors in
connection with rendering to the Board of Directors the opinion described above. The following summary, however,
does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the
order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some
of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read
together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial
analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Implied Premia Analysis
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia and multiples described below based on the $77.50 in
cash per share of Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $77.50 in cash per share of Zendesk common stock
relative to:
•
$57.95, the closing price for Zendesk common stock on June 23, 2022, the last full trading day prior to
signing the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Current Share Price” in this section of this proxy
statement);
•
$153.43, the highest trading price of Zendesk common stock over the 52-week period ended June 23, 2022
(which we refer to as the “52-Week High” in this section of this proxy statement);
•
$54.16, the lowest trading price of Zendesk common stock over the 52-week period ended June 23, 2022
(which we refer to as the “52-Week Low” in this section of this proxy statement);
•
$59.28, the average closing trading price of Zendesk common stock since the conclusion of the strategic
review process was announced pre-market on June 9, 2022 (which we refer to as the “Post-Strategic Review
Price” in this section of this proxy statement;
•
$76.42, the average closing trading price of Zendesk common stock over the one-month period ended June
23, 2022 (which we refer to as the “1-Month Average” in this section of this proxy statement); and
•
$102.81, the average closing trading price of Zendesk common stock over the three-month period ended
June 23, 2022 (which we refer to as the “3-Month Average” in this section of this proxy statement).
The results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of Zendesk. Using a
mid-year discounting convention and discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0%, reflecting estimates of Zendesk’s
weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of March 31, 2022 (a) estimates of
the unlevered free cash flows (excluding the impact of net operating losses), which are referred to as “UFCF,” for the
second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through 2030 as reflected in the Forecasts,
and (b) a range of illustrative terminal values for Zendesk, which were calculated by applying exit terminal year, next
twelve months’, which we refer to as “NTM,” UFCF multiples ranging from 20.0x to 32.5x, to a terminal year NTM
UFCF, to be generated by Zendesk, as reflected in the Forecasts (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates
ranging from 5.0% to 8.9%). Goldman Sachs derived the discount rates referenced above by application of the Capital
Asset Pricing Model, which is referred to as “CAPM,” which requires certain company-specific inputs, including
Zendesk’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and
a beta for Zendesk, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The
illustrative terminal value to NTM UFCF multiple
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
range for Zendesk was derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into
account, among other things, enterprise value over NTM UFCF as of June 23, 2022 of certain publicly traded
companies, as described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Selected Public Company
Comparables.”
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Zendesk by adding the ranges of present values it
derived as described in the immediately preceding paragraph. Goldman Sachs then added to the range of illustrative
enterprise values it derived for Zendesk the amount of net cash of Zendesk as of March 31, 2022 and the net present
value of net operating losses as reflected in the Forecasts, in each case, as provided by Zendesk management and
approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Zendesk management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for
Zendesk. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted
outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock, calculated using the treasury stock method, as provided by Zendesk
management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Zendesk management, to derive a range of illustrative present
values per share of Zendesk common stock ranging from $66 to $116, rounded to the nearest dollar.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price
Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share
of Zendesk common stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2022
through 2025. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value per share of Zendesk common stock as of
December 31, for each of the fiscal years 2022 through 2024, by applying multiples of enterprise value to NTM
revenue, which we refer to as “EV/NTM revenue” in this section of this proxy statement, of 4.5x to 8.0x to estimates
of Zendesk’s revenue for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025. These illustrative EV/NTM revenue multiple estimates
were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and
historical EV/NTM revenue multiples for Zendesk during the six-month, one-year, three-year and five-year periods
ending June 23, 2022, as described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Historical EV/NTM Trading
Multiples.” Goldman Sachs then added the amount of Zendesk’s forecasted net cash as of December 31 for each of
the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, as provided by Zendesk management, from the respective implied enterprise values in
order to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Zendesk. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the
number of projected year-end fully diluted outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock for each of the fiscal years
2022 to 2024, calculated based on estimated annual dilution and the number of fully diluted shares of Zendesk
common stock estimated to be outstanding as of June 22, 2022, calculated using the treasury stock method, each as
provided and approved by Zendesk management. Goldman Sachs then discounted the implied per share future equity
values for the twelve-month periods ending on December 31, 2022, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024,
respectively, back to March 31, 2022, using an illustrative discount rate of 10.9%, reflecting an estimate of Zendesk’s
cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of CAPM, which requires certain company-
specific inputs, including a beta for the company as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial
markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Zendesk common stock of
$64 to $124, rounded to the nearest dollar.
Goldman Sachs also performed an illustrative present value of future share price analysis, by calculating the implied
enterprise values per share of Zendesk common stock as of December 31, for each of the fiscal years 2022 through
2024, by applying enterprise value to growth-adjusted EV/NTM revenue multiples adjusted using NTM revenue
growth, of 0.2375x to 0.3500x to NTM revenue estimates and NTM revenue growth for Zendesk for each of the fiscal
years 2023 to 2025. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2022 through
2025. These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and
experience, taking into account current and historical growth-adjusted EV/NTM revenue multiples for Zendesk, as
described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Historical EV/NTM Trading Multiples.” Goldman
Sachs then added the amount of Zendesk’s forecasted net cash as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to
2024, as provided by Zendesk management, from the respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a range of
illustrative equity values for Zendesk. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the number of projected year-end
fully diluted outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, calculated based
on estimated annual dilution and the number of fully diluted shares of Zendesk common stock estimated to be
outstanding as of June 22, 2022, calculated using the treasury stock method, each as provided and approved by
Zendesk management. Goldman

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions in the
software industry since 2016. For each of the selected transactions where information was publicly available,
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied EV/NTM revenue of the applicable target company based on the
total consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target company’s NTM revenue based on Institutional
Brokers’ Estimate System estimates (which are referred to as “IBES estimates”) at the time each such selected
transaction was announced.

Based on the total consideration payable by Thoma Bravo, L.P. for Anaplan, Inc. as of March 2022.
While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to Zendesk, the
companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations that for purposes of this
analysis may be considered similar based on certain characteristics of Zendesk’s results, market size and product
profile.
Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ analyses of the various transactions and its
professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs used NTM revenue of $1,811 million, calculated using a time-
weighting of fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023 as of June 23, 2022, to derive a range of implied
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
enterprise values for Zendesk. Goldman Sachs then added to the range of implied enterprise values the amount of
Zendesk’s net cash as of March 31, 2022, as provided by Zendesk management and approved for Goldman Sachs’
use by Zendesk management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Zendesk. Goldman Sachs divided the
results by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock, calculated using the treasury
stock method, as provided by Zendesk management and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Zendesk management,
to derive a range of implied equity values per share of Zendesk common stock of $98 to $186, rounded to the nearest
dollar.
Precedent M&A Premia
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash
acquisition transactions announced during the time period from April 2016 through June 2022 involving a public
company in the software industry as the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were greater
than $1 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th
percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in each of the transactions relative to the target’s last
undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium
of 36% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 20% and 75th percentile premium
of 56% across the period. Using this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a
reference range of illustrative premia of 20% to 56% to the closing price per share of Zendesk common stock of $57.95
as of June 23, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Zendesk common stock of $70 to $90,
rounded to the nearest dollar.
Historical EV/NTM Revenue Multiples
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared EV/NTM revenue multiples and growth-adjusted EV/NTM revenue
multiples adjusted using NTM revenue growth for Zendesk based on financial and trading data as of June 23, 2022,
information Goldman Sachs obtained from Bloomberg, publicly available historical data, market data and IBES
estimates. Goldman Sachs calculated average EV/NTM revenue multiples and average growth-adjusted EV/NTM
revenue multiples over certain time periods prior to and including June 23, 2022.

General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the
analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In
arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.
No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Zendesk or the
Merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Board of Directors as to the
fairness from a financial point of view to Zendesk, as of the date of its written opinion, of the $77.50 in cash per share
of Zendesk common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to
the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at
which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Zendesk, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any
other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Zendesk and Parent and was
approved by the Board of Directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Zendesk during these negotiations. Goldman
Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to Zendesk or the Board of Directors or
that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Board of Directors in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing
summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection
with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached
as Annex C to this proxy statement.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and
trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various
persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in
which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold
or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit
default swaps and other financial instruments of Zendesk, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties,
including Permira and H&F, each of which is an affiliate of a significant equityholder of Parent, and any of their
respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in
the Merger or other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Zendesk in connection with, and participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to, the Merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting
services to Zendesk and its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs
has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as bookrunner with respect to the public
offering by Zendesk of 2025 Convertible Notes (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Capped
Call Transactions”) in an aggregate principal amount of $1.15 billion in June 2020. During the two-year period ended
June 24, 2022, Goldman Sachs has not recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services
provided by its Investment Banking Division to Zendesk and/or its affiliates.
As further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Capped Call Transactions,” in March 2018,
Zendesk offered its 2023 Convertible Notes (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Capped Call
Transactions”) in an aggregate principal amount of $575 million, with respect to which Goldman Sachs acted as
bookrunner and, concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “-Capped Call Transactions”), Zendesk entered into the Capped Call Transactions with the Capped
Call Counterparties (each as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Capped Call Transactions”),
including Goldman Sachs (with respect to 50% of the 2023 Convertible Notes and 20% of the 2025 Convertible Notes,
respectively), each acting as principal for its own account, consisting of the purchase by Zendesk of capped call
options with respect to collectively approximately 4,558,428 shares of Zendesk common stock from the 2023
Convertible Notes and 2,114,712 shares of Zendesk common stock from the 2025 Convertible Notes, the aggregate
number of shares of Zendesk common stock underlying the Convertible Notes (at the initial conversion rate of 9.1944
shares of Zendesk common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes and of 15.8554 shares of
Zendesk common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2023 Convertible Notes). As of July 20, 2022, 100% of the
2020 Capped Call Transactions (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Capped Call
Transactions”) remain outstanding, with a strike price of approximately $108.76 and a cap price of $164.17 and
approximately 26% of the 2018 Capped Call Transactions (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-
Capped Call Transactions”) remain outstanding, with a strike price of approximately $63.07 and a cap price of $95.20.
The Capped Call Transactions were intended to offset a portion of the potential dilutive effect on Zendesk
stockholders of the conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or any potential cash payment in excess of the principal
amount of the Convertible Notes that Zendesk may make in connection with a cash settlement of the Convertible
Notes, up to the cap price. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Capped Call Transactions” for a
detailed description of the Capped Call Transactions, including Goldman Sachs’ and the other Capped Call
Counterparties’ ability to adjust the terms of the Capped Call Transactions in connection with certain events
(including the Merger).
As a result of the Capped Call Transactions, the Capped Call Counterparties are expected to have market exposure to
the price of the shares of Zendesk common stock. It is the ordinary practice of the Capped Call Counterparties to
engage in hedging activities to limit their respective market exposure to the price of the stock underlying privately
negotiated equity derivative transactions with issuers of such stock, such as the Capped Call Transactions. In
connection with the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, Goldman Sachs (and its affiliates) have engaged,
and will continue to engage, in accordance with applicable law in hedging and other
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
market transactions (which may include the entering into or unwinding of various derivative transactions with
respect to Zendesk common stock) that are generally intended to substantially neutralize Goldman Sachs’ exposure
as a result of the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party to changes in the price of Zendesk common stock.
Such hedging activity is at Goldman Sachs’ own risk and may result in a gain or loss to Goldman Sachs that may be
greater than or less than the initial expected contractual benefit to Goldman Sachs under the Capped Call
Transactions to which it is a party. The amount of any such gain or loss will not be known until the applicable
Capped Call Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and Goldman
Sachs shall have completed all of its hedge unwind activities. To mitigate the exposure from the Capped Call
Transactions, as of July 20, 2022, Goldman Sachs held a net long economic position of approximately 750,000 shares
of Zendesk common stock.
Goldman Sachs provided to management of Zendesk, for the information of the Board of Directors, materials that
summarized, based on theoretical models, the potential effects of the announcement and of the consummation of an
acquisition of Zendesk on the Capped Call Transactions. The materials included preliminary illustrative analyses by
Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division for a range of stated assumptions regarding takeout prices for shares
of Zendesk common stock and volatilities, as well as based on other reasonable assumptions, in the event of an
acquisition of Zendesk for greater than 10 percent cash consideration. In accordance with industry practice, Goldman
Sachs maintains customary institutional information barriers reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized
disclosure of confidential information by personnel in its Investment Banking Division to the personnel in its
Securities Division who are undertaking hedging and other market transactions with respect to Goldman Sachs’
capped call transactions. In connection with the preparation of presentations to senior management of Zendesk and
the Board of Directors, personnel in Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division, including the representatives of
Goldman Sachs who have advised Zendesk in connection with the Merger, from time to time, have received or may
receive input from personnel in Goldman Sachs’ Securities Division into how to model, or reports of historical
measures or estimates of, Goldman Sachs’ and/or Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division’s profit and/or loss
over certain measurement periods related to the Capped Call Transactions.
Goldman Sachs has advised Zendesk that as of July 20, 2022, assuming the Merger is consummated on July 25, 2022,
Goldman Sachs expects to realize a net gain of up to approximately $1.4 million with respect to the 2018 Capped Call
Transactions, and a net gain ranging from approximately $1.1 million to approximately $4.0 million with respect to the
2020 Capped Call Transactions, in each case, as a result of the Merger, after giving effect to its hedging activities
based on the ordinary hedging practices described above and based on a range of stated assumptions, including
volatilities (from 35 percent to 70 percent) and other reasonable assumptions. The amount of any such gain will not
be known until the Capped Call Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their
terms and Goldman Sachs and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind activities, and such amount may differ
from the estimates provided above. As further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Capped Call
Transactions,” the indentures governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms
of the Capped Call Transactions were filed with the SEC, and all references in this proxy statement to share counts,
conversion prices, cap prices and strike prices are subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with the
terms of the confirmations relating to the Capped Call Transactions.
Goldman Sachs has also provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Permira and/or its
affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and may
receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Permira Advisers (UK), an affiliate of Permira,
with respect to its acquisition of a majority stake in Golden Goose in June 2020; as joint bookrunner with respect to
the initial public offering by Allegro.eu, a portfolio company of Permira, of 187,826,087 of its ordinary shares in
September 2020 and the public offering of 76,500,000 of its ordinary shares in March 2021; as lead left bookrunner
with respect to the issuance by Lowell Financial Ltd., a portfolio company of Permira, of EUR/GBP high yield bonds
(aggregate principal amount of £400,000,000 plus €1,340,000,000) in October 2020; as joint bookrunner with respect to
the initial public offering by Dr. Martens plc, a portfolio company of Permira, of 350,000,000 of its ordinary shares in
January 2021; as bookrunner with respect to the sale by Permira of 12,000,000 shares of TeamViewer AG, a portfolio
company of Permira, in February 2021; as bookrunner with respect to the public offering by Golden Goose, a portfolio
company of Permira, of its Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (aggregate principal amount of €480,000,000) in May 2021;
as bookrunner with respect to the initial public offering by Clearwater Analytics Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company

of Permira, of 34,500,000 of its Class A common stock in September 2021; as bookrunner with respect to the initial
public offering by Informatica Inc., a portfolio company of Permira, of 33,350,000 of its Class A common stock in
October 2021; and as financial advisor to Permira Advisers (HK), an affiliate of Permira, with respect to its sale of
Tricor Holdings Limited in June 2022. During the two-year period ended June 24, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized
compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to
Permira and/or its affiliates of approximately $133 million.
Goldman Sachs has also provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to H&F and/or its affiliates
and portfolio companies from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive,
compensation, including having acted as a lead bookrunner with respect to the public offering by PPD, Inc., a
portfolio company of H&F, of 43,700,000 shares of its common stock in September 2020; as bookrunner with respect
to the issuance by MultiPlan Corporation, a portfolio company of H&F, of high yield bonds (aggregate principal
amount of $1,300,000,000) in October 2020; as financial advisor to Change Healthcare Inc., a portfolio company of
H&F, with respect to its pending sale announced in January 2021; as bookrunner with respect to the issuance by
Verisure SA, a portfolio company of H&F, of high yield bonds (aggregate principal amount of €2,325,000,000 plus kr
1,500,000,000) in January 2021; as bookrunner with respect to the issuance by Medline Industries Inc., a portfolio
company of H&F, of high yield bonds (aggregate principal amount of $7,770,000,000) in October 2021; and as
bookrunner with respect to the issuance by athenahealth, Inc., a portfolio company of H&F, of high yield bonds
(aggregate principal amount of $2,350,000,000) in January 2022. During the two-year period ended June 24, 2022,
Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its
Investment Banking Division to H&F and/or its affiliates of approximately $135 million.
Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Zendesk, Parent,
Permira, H&F and their respective affiliates and/or, as applicable, portfolio companies for which its Investment
Banking Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-invested with Permira,
H&F and their respective affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of
Permira and H&F from time to time and may do so in the future.
The Board of Directors selected Goldman Sachs as one of its financial advisors because it is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to
an engagement letter dated March 25, 2022, Zendesk engaged Goldman Sachs to act as one of its financial advisors in
connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between Zendesk and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction
fee that is currently estimated to be approximately $10.2 million, $4 million of which became payable at the
announcement of the Merger, and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In
addition, Zendesk has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including reasonable attorneys’
fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including
certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
Capped Call Transactions",49,71
Zendesk MA.Pdf,Capped Call Transactions,"Capped Call Transactions
On March 15, 2018, in connection with the pricing of Zendesk’s 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (which we
refer to as the “2023 Convertible Notes”), Zendesk entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (which
we refer to as the “2018 Capped Call Transactions”) with each of Citibank, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch,
Goldman Sachs or their respective affiliates (which we refer to as the “2018 Capped Call Counterparties”). On June 11,
2020, in connection with the pricing of Zendesk’s 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (which we refer to as the
“2025 Convertible Notes” and, together with the 2023 Convertible Notes, the “Convertible Notes”), Zendesk entered
into privately negotiated capped call transactions (which we refer to as the “2020 Base Capped Call Transactions”)
with each of Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Goldman Sachs, Bank of Montreal, Société Générale,
Barclays Bank PLC or their respective affiliates (which we refer to as the “2020 Capped Call Counterparties” and,
together with the 2018 Capped Call Counterparties, the “Capped Call Counterparties”). On June 12, 2020, in
connection with the initial purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, Zendesk
entered into additional capped call transactions with each of the 2020 Capped Call Counterparties (which we refer to
as the “2020 Additional Capped Call Transactions” and, together with the 2020 Base Capped Call Transactions, the
“2020 Capped Call Transactions”, and together with the 2018 Capped Call Transactions, the “Capped Call
Transactions”). The Capped Call Transactions initially covered, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the
number of shares of Zendesk common stock that initially underlie the applicable Existing Notes (as defined in the
Merger Agreement). The
61TABLE OF CONTENTS
strike price of the 2018 Capped Call Transactions is $63.07 per share of Zendesk common stock, and the cap price of
the 2018 Capped Call Transactions is $95.20 per share of Zendesk common stock, and is subject to certain
adjustments under the terms of the 2018 Capped Call Transactions. The strike price of the 2020 Capped Call
Transactions is $108.76 per share of Zendesk common stock, and the cap price of the 2020 Capped Call Transactions
is $164.17 per share of Zendesk common stock, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2020
Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to
Zendesk stockholders upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset the potential cash payments that
Zendesk could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted Convertible Notes upon
conversion thereof, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price.
If the Merger is consummated, holders of the Existing Notes may convert their Existing Notes, and the consummation
of the Merger is expected to result in termination of the Capped Call Transactions. The value received by the
Company in connection with the termination or unwind of the Capped Call Transactions would be determined by the
Capped Call Counterparties based on the fair value of the Capped Call Transactions, which is contingent on a variety
of factors including, but not limited to, volatility, spot price and liquidity.
In addition, following the announcement of the Merger, the Capped Call Counterparties may adjust the terms of the
applicable Capped Call Transactions on more than one occasion to reflect the economic effect of such
announcement, including if such economic effect is material, and regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.
Each Capped Call Counterparty shall, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, in its capacity as
calculation agent with respect to its Capped Call Transaction, determine whether such announcement has had a
material economic effect, in the case of the 2020 Capped Call Transactions, or an economic effect in the case of the
2018 Capped Call Transactions, in either case on such Capped Call Transaction and may take into account a number
of factors, including the date of the announcement (and the remaining term of its Capped Call Transaction at that
time), the stock price of Zendesk common stock and changes in volatility, stock loan rate, liquidity and expected
dividends of Zendesk common stock, in determining whether an adjustment to the cap price of its Capped Call
Transaction is appropriate. Each Capped Call Counterparty may make additional adjustments to the cap price of its
Capped Call Transaction following the announcement of a change to the Merger, including a withdrawal from, or the

Zendesk MA.Pdf,Certain Financial Projections,"Certain Financial Projections
Other than its quarterly financial guidance and business outlook, Zendesk does not as a matter of course make public
projections as to future revenues, earnings or other results available due to, among other reasons, the inherent
difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty, unpredictability and
subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with Zendesk’s proposed
acquisition of Momentive Global, Inc. announced in October 2021, Zendesk management prepared certain unaudited,
preliminary financial forecasts for Zendesk for fiscal years 2021 through 2025, which were publicly disclosed in
connection with the proposed acquisition and used by Zendesk’s financial advisors in connection with their
evaluation of the unsolicited offer by the Consortium in February 2022.
In March 2022, in connection with the strategic review process, Zendesk management prepared certain unaudited,
preliminary financial forecasts for Zendesk for fiscal years 2022 through 2025, which were updated in May 2022 to
reflect certain changes noted in the table below (which, as so updated, we refer to as the “March 2022 Projections”).
The March 2022 Projections were extrapolated through fiscal year 2031 by Zendesk management (we refer to such
extrapolations and the March 2022 Projections, collectively, as the “March 2022 Case”) in connection with Qatalyst
Partners’ and Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses of preliminary indications of interest submitted by bidders in the
strategic review process.
In June 2022, in the context of evaluating the Consortium’s proposals, Zendesk management updated the March 2022
Case to take into account changes in the internal and external business environment, including
62TABLE OF CONTENTS
negative trends in gross and net bookings momentum, below-expectation actual gross and net bookings for the
months of April and May 2022, challenges to Zendesk’s performance resulting from elevated levels of attrition in
critical sales functions and employee distraction as well as significant changes in economic conditions facing
Zendesk and its industry more generally, including increased risk of recession, persistent high inflation and the
impact of macroeconomic headwinds on Zendesk’s customer segments (which as so updated, we refer to as the
“June 2022 Case”).
The March 2022 Case and the June 2022 Case are referred to in this section of this proxy statement collectively as the
“Management Projections.” Zendesk is including a summary of the March 2022 Case and the June 2022 Case to
provide Zendesk stockholders with access to information that was made available to the Board of Directors in
connection with their evaluation of the Merger and the Merger Consideration. The March 2022 Projections (but not
the extrapolations from 2026 to 2031) were also made available to Parent and Merger Sub at Parent’s request in
connection with their due diligence review.
The Board of Directors reviewed the June 2022 Case and, following discussions with Zendesk management, the
Board of Directors authorized Zendesk’s financial advisors to use the June 2022 Case, or a subset thereof, for
purposes of their respective financial analyses and fairness opinions summarized in the sections of this proxy
statement entitled “-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP” and “-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.” The inclusion of
this information should not be regarded as an indication that Zendesk, Parent, their affiliates or financial advisors, or
any of their respective representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the
Management Projections to be necessarily predictive of future results.
The following table summarizes the March 2022 Case, as described above:

Important Information Regarding the Management Projections
The Management Projections were prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and were provided to
the Board of Directors for the purposes of Zendesk’s strategic review process. The Management Projections were
also provided to and used by Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs, Zendesk’s financial advisors, for the purpose of
performing financial analyses in connection with the strategic review process and, in the case of the June 2022 Case,
for the purpose of evaluating the fairness of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view. As described
above, the March 2022 Projections (but not the extrapolations from 2026 to 2031) were also made available to bidders
in the strategic review process.
The Management Projections are not included in this proxy statement to influence any decision on whether to vote
for the Merger Agreement Proposal, but rather are included in this proxy statement to give stockholders access to
certain non-public information that was provided to the Board of Directors, Zendesk’s financial advisors and Parent
for purposes of considering and evaluating the Merger. The inclusion of the Management Projections should not be
regarded as an indication that the Board of Directors, Zendesk, Parent, or their respective affiliates or financial
advisors or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, them to be necessarily predictive of
actual future results, and they should not be relied on as such. There can be no assurance that the projected results
will be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower or higher than estimated, whether or not the Merger is
completed.
The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward
compliance with the published guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, or GAAP, but, in the view of
Zendesk management, were reasonably prepared in good faith on a basis reflecting the best available estimates and
judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation. However, this information is not
fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily predictive of actual future results, and readers of this proxy
statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Management Projections. Although the Management
Projections were prepared on a reasonable basis, Zendesk cautions stockholders that actual future results could be
materially different from the Management Projections. Zendesk’s independent registered public accounting firm,
Ernst & Young LLP, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect
to the Management Projections and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with
respect thereto.
The Management Projections are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to
interpretation. While presented with numerical specificity, the Management Projections are based upon
64
TABLE OF CONTENTS
a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by Zendesk
management, as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be impacted by any
number of factors, including general economic conditions, trends in the software industry, regulatory and financial
market conditions and the risks and uncertainties described or incorporated by reference in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements,” all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond
the control of Zendesk. The Management Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that
are subject to change. Because the Management Projections were developed for Zendesk as an independent
company without giving effect to the Merger, they do not reflect any divestitures or other restrictions that may be
imposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, or any changes to
Zendesk’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after completion of the Merger. There can be no assurance
that the Management Projections will be realized, and actual results will likely differ, and may differ materially, from
those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the Management Projections relate, the less predictive the
information becomes.
The Management Projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Zendesk management believes are
helpful in understanding Zendesk’s past financial performance and future results. Zendesk management regularly
uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring
financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While Zendesk believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide
meaningful information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze Zendesk’s financial and
business trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP
financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported
by all of Zendesk’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Zendesk’s
competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise
require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP
financial measures provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed business
combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition,
reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Board of Directors, Parent, or their
respective affiliates or financial advisors in connection with their respective evaluations of the Merger. Accordingly,
Zendesk has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Management
Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
None of Zendesk, Parent, or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can
provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Management Projections, and, except as required by
applicable law, none of Zendesk, Parent, or their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update, or
otherwise revise or reconcile, the Management Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the
Management Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all
of the assumptions underlying the Management Projections are shown to be inappropriate. None of Zendesk or its
affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any Zendesk
stockholder or other person regarding Zendesk’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the
Management Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved. Zendesk has made no representation to Parent,
in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Management Projections.
Interests of Zendesk’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, Zendesk
stockholders should be aware that Zendesk’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may
be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Zendesk stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware
of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, in
reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(including the Merger) and in recommending to Zendesk stockholders that the Merger Agreement Proposal be
approved. Such interests are described below. There are no current or former Zendesk executive officers, other than
the Zendesk “named executive officers” (as defined below), who have interests in the Merger that are different from,
or in addition to, the interests of Zendesk stockholders generally.
65
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in
this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of Zendesk common stock is $77.50, which is the Merger Consideration;
•
The Effective Time as referenced in this section of this proxy statement occurred on December 1, 2022,
which is the assumed date of the Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section of this
proxy statement; and
•
The employment of each executive officer of Zendesk is terminated without “cause” or due to the executive
officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in
either case immediately following the assumed Effective Time.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be
accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation
actions that may occur before completion of the Merger. For purposes of the discussion in this section of this proxy
statement, “single trigger” refers to benefits that arise solely as a result of the completion of the Merger and “double
trigger” refers to benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger and either the
completion of a subsequent, time-based vesting period or a qualifying termination of employment on or following the
Effective Time.
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, outstanding Zendesk equity awards
(including those held by the executive officers of Zendesk) will be treated as follows, subject to all required tax
withholdings:
•
at the Effective Time, each in-the-money Stock Option that is vested by its terms and outstanding
immediately prior to Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive, without interest,
at the Effective Time, a cash award equal to the Aggregate Option Spread Value of such Stock Option.
•
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each in-the-money Stock Option that is then outstanding and not
vested by its terms will be canceled and converted as of the Effective Time into a cash award equal to the
Aggregate Option Spread Value of such Stock Option, which will remain subject to the same time-vesting
terms and conditions that applied to the associated Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the requirement of continued service with the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates through the
applicable vesting date, as applicable, and the applicable cash amounts will be paid out, without interest,
on the next payroll date following the applicable vesting dates, so long as the applicable portion of the
cash award became or becomes vested prior to the applicable holder’s termination of service with the
Surviving Corporation and its affiliates.
•
at the Effective Time, each Stock Option (whether vested or unvested) for which the exercise price per share
is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled at the Closing (as defined in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “-Closing and Effective Time”) without payment.
•
at the Effective Time, each vested RSU Award will cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares
of Zendesk common stock, will be canceled and will entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation, without interest, at the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share underlying such RSU Award.
•
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unvested RSU Award will be canceled and converted as of the
Effective Time into a cash award (assuming achievement of performance for performance-based RSU Award
using the same formula provided for in the applicable award agreement). Such cash award will equal the
amount of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share underlying such RSU Award and will remain
subject to the same time-vesting terms and conditions that applied to such RSU Award (except for any
performance-based vesting conditions), immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the requirement
of continued service with the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates through the applicable vesting date or
through the end of the original performance period, as applicable, and the
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
applicable cash amounts will be paid out, without interest, on the next payroll date following the applicable
vesting dates, so long as the applicable portion of the cash award became or becomes vested prior to the
applicable holder’s termination of service with the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates.
Based on the assumptions described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Certain Assumptions,” the
estimated aggregate value of the unvested Zendesk equity awards that will be held by Zendesk’s executive officers
as of the Closing Date are as follows: (a) Aggregate Option Spread Value of vested in-the-money Stock Options -
$167,463,269.10; (b) Aggregate Option Spread Value of unvested in-the-money Stock Options - $34,753.68; and (c)
unvested RSU Awards (with performance for performance-based unvested RSUs deemed achieved at target) -
$27,267,135.00. Zendesk’s executive officers do not hold any vested RSU Awards. Please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Zendesk’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger” for the estimated value of each named executive officer’s unvested Zendesk equity
awards, all of which are afforded “double trigger” treatment.
Based on the assumptions described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Certain Assumptions,” the
estimated aggregate value of the unvested RSU Awards held by Zendesk’s nonemployee directors, all of which will
become fully vested upon the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, is
$1,800,000, and they are afforded “single-trigger” treatment. Zendesk’s nonemployee directors do not hold any Stock
Options.
Change in Control Acceleration Plan
Each of our named executive officers is a participant in the Zendesk Change in Control Acceleration Plan (which we
refer to as the “CIC Plan”). Under the CIC Plan, in the event that a participant’s employment is terminated on or within
12 months following the date of a change in control (which the Merger will constitute) either (a) by Zendesk other
than for cause (as defined in the CIC Plan), death or disability, or (b) by the participant with good reason (as defined
in the CIC Plan), the vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options and other stock-based awards (including the
Retention Grants described below and the cash awards described above) that are subject to time-based vesting and
that are then held by the participant will immediately accelerate and become exercisable or nonforfeitable, as
applicable, as of the date of such a termination. The CIC Plan also provides that payments under the CIC Plan will be
reduced in order to eliminate exposure to an excise tax that would otherwise be imposed under Section 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if the participant will retain a greater net after-tax amount if such
reduction is applied (a “better of net after-tax cutback”).
Severance Plan
In connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, Zendesk is implementing a severance plan (which we refer
to as the “Severance Plan”) for all employees of Zendesk, including Zendesk’s executive officers. The Severance Plan
provides for different levels of severance benefits depending on the participant’s seniority with Zendesk in
connection with a termination of the participant’s employment by Zendesk without cause or by the participant for
good reason (each term as defined in the Severance Plan). For Zendesk’s executive officers, those severance benefits
are: (a) a lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of the participant’s (i) annual rate of base salary and (ii)
annual target bonus opportunity; (b) 12 months of COBRA premium payments; and (c) either (i) if the termination
occurs prior to the Effective Time, acceleration of equity awards that would have become vested within six months
after termination, or (ii) if the termination occurs during the one year after the Effective Time, acceleration of vesting
of all then outstanding equity awards pursuant to the CIC Plan, including any cash awards into which the
participant’s Zendesk equity awards were converted in connection with the Merger. Participants must sign a release
of claims against Zendesk to receive these severance payments. The Severance Plan does not provide for a gross-up
payment to any of the executive officers, or any other eligible employee, to offset any excise taxes that may be
imposed under Section 4999 of the Code.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
Zendesk’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” for the estimated value of each named executive
officer’s severance benefits under the Severance Plan.
Equity Retention Grants
On June 23, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted an equity-based retention program, pursuant to which certain
executives at or above the level of Vice President and above, including Messrs. McDermott and Gennaro,
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and Mses. Glaser and Constantinople, were granted RSU Awards that vest one year from the grant date (or earlier in
accordance with the terms of the CIC Plan), subject to the recipient’s continued employment with Zendesk and its
subsidiaries through such date (which we refer to as the “Retention Grants”). The Retention Grants will be converted
into cash awards in connection with the Merger, as provided above.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
Zendesk’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” for the estimated value of each named executive
officer’s Retention Grant, which is afforded “double trigger” treatment.
Transaction Incentive Pool
In connection with the Merger, the Compensation Committee may award up to $30 million in discretionary bonuses to
Zendesk employees for retention purposes, including up to $7.5 million, in the aggregate, in discretionary bonuses
(which we refer to as the “Incentive Bonuses”) to certain executive officers (other than the CEO), subject to
continued employment of such officers through January 1, 2023 (or, if earlier, on and after the Closing, a severance-
qualifying event under the Severance Plan) and the Compensation Committee’s evaluation, as of the Closing Date, of
each such officer’s individual performance during the period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the
Closing Date. If the Effective Time has not occurred by March 15, 2023, the amount of the Incentive Bonus will be
credited against any annual cash incentive bonus that becomes payable under the 2022 bonus plan (as described
below). The Compensation Committee has not determined the amount of discretionary bonuses, if any, that may
become payable to any of the executive officers pursuant to the transaction incentive pool.
Treatment of 2022 Annual Bonus
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, if the Effective Time occurs on or before December 31, 2022, Parent will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its affiliates to, honor, in accordance with its terms, each of the
Zendesk benefit plans providing for annual cash incentive bonus opportunities for 2022 (or portion thereof). Parent
will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its affiliates to, pay to each Zendesk employee (including
Messrs. Svane, McDermott and Gennaro, and Mses. Glaser and Constantinople (our “named executive officers” for
purposes of this proxy statement)) who participates in a 2022 bonus plan a bonus otherwise earned in accordance
with the terms and conditions of such 2022 bonus plan (including any condition of continued employment); provided
that the aggregate of all such employee bonuses company-wide to be paid under the 2022 bonus plan must be no
less than 50% of the aggregate target bonus amount for all such employees. The Compensation Committee has not
yet determined the level of performance achievement under the 2022 bonus plan, and therefore has not yet
determined the amount of annual cash incentive bonuses, if any, that may become payable to any of the executive
officers pursuant to the 2022 bonus plan.
Transition Services Agreement with Alex Constantinople
On July 28, 2022, Zendesk and Alex Constantinople entered into a transition services agreement, under which Ms.
Constantinople will continue to serve in her role as Chief Marketing Officer of Zendesk through September 30, 2022
(or such earlier date as Zendesk may determine), at which time Ms. Constantinople’s employment with Zendesk will
end. In consideration of the foregoing, and subject to execution of a release of claims at the end of employment, Ms.
Constantinople will receive: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to $210,000 (six months of her current base salary),
(b) immediate vesting of any then-unvested stock options and time-vesting restricted stock unit awards (excluding
the award granted to her on June 23, 2022) that are otherwise scheduled to vest on or before March 31, 2023, and (c) a
prorated portion of her target bonus for the nine-month period of service during the fiscal year equal to $189,000
(paid at such time as annual bonuses are payable). By entering into this transition services agreement, Ms.
Constantinople ceases to be eligible to receive any payments or benefits under any other severance or equity
acceleration plans of Zendesk, including the CIC Plan. In addition, Zendesk has waived the obligation that Ms.
Constantinople repay the remaining portion of the signing bonus she received when she commenced employment in
2021.
Potential Employment Arrangements with Parent
Any of Zendesk’s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide
services to Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, prior to, on or following the Closing, enter into
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
new compensation arrangements with Parent or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no
new individualized compensation arrangements between Zendesk’s executive officers and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation have been established.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Zendesk’s directors and executive officers will be entitled, among
other things, to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six years following the Effective Time
under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and
insurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-
Indemnification and Insurance.”
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Zendesk’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which
requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of Zendesk that is
based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, neither our former chief financial officer
Elena Gomez, nor our former deputy chief financial officer and interim chief financial officer Michael Cabi, is
referenced below, because their employment terminated prior to the end of our most recently completed fiscal year, at
which time both such individuals ceased to be eligible for any compensatory payments or benefits described in this
proxy statement. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, please see
the section of this proxy statement entitled “Interests of Zendesk’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger”
above.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the
table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the Merger. For purposes
of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of Zendesk common stock is $77.50, which is the Merger Consideration;
•
The Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on December 1, 2022, which is the assumed date of
the Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
The employment of each executive officer of Zendesk (other than Ms. Constantinople) is terminated
without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined
in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the assumed Effective Time. For
Ms. Constantinople, the below amounts assume she continues to serve in her role through September 30,
2022.

As noted above, the Compensation Committee may award up to $7.5 million in the aggregate in discretionary cash transaction
incentive bonuses to certain executive officers (other than the CEO), subject to continued employment of such officers through
January 1, 2023 (or, if earlier, on and after the Closing, a severance-qualifying event under the Severance Plan), but the
Compensation Committee has not yet determined the amount of discretionary bonuses, if any, that may become payable to any
of the executive officers pursuant to this transaction incentive pool.

Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, and to
pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement,
will be approximately $10.47 billion, taking into account cash and cash equivalents of Zendesk and its subsidiaries on
hand at the Closing. This amount includes funds needed to: (a) pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of
the Zendesk common stock (other than the Unconverted Shares), (b) make payments in respect of the vested and
outstanding Zendesk equity awards payable in connection with the Closing, and (c) make payments of cash (i) in
connection with an offer to purchase the Existing Notes (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to the holders thereof
in amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes tendered and accepted for payment and (ii) upon
conversion of the Existing Notes in connection with any Fundamental Change and Make-Whole Fundamental
Change (each as defined in the Existing Notes Indentures (as defined in the Merger Agreement)), in each case on or
after the Closing Date (which we refer to, collectively, as the “Required Amounts”).
Parent and Merger Sub have obtained committed Financing consisting of (a) Equity Financing to be provided by the
Equity Financing Sources pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters, (b) Debt Financing
to be provided pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter by the Debt Commitment Parties
party thereto and (c) Preferred Equity Financing to be provided pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Preferred
Equity Commitment Letter. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to
Zendesk copies of the Commitment Letters. Notwithstanding anything
70
TABLE OF CONTENTS
in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters) by or to Parent or any of its affiliates or any other
financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Equity Financing
Sources have committed to capitalize Parent at the Closing with an aggregate equity contribution equal to
approximately $6.32 billion for the purpose of funding the Required Amounts. The obligations of each Equity
Financing Source to provide the Equity Financing under the Equity Commitment Letters are subject to a number of
conditions, including, but not limited to: (a) the satisfaction in full, or waiver by Parent, of each of the conditions to
the obligations of Parent to consummate the transactions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 of the Merger
Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided, that
those other conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (b) the substantially concurrent
consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (c) the Debt Financing (or any
alternative thereto in accordance with the Merger Agreement) (i) has been funded or (ii) would be funded upon the
delivery of a drawdown notice by Parent and subject only to the satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing (provided that those conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the Closing),
and substantially simultaneously with the funding of the Equity Financing and (d) the prior or substantially
concurrent funding of the applicable equity commitment of each other Equity Financing Source under its applicable
Equity Commitment Letter. We refer to the equity financing described in the preceding sentence as the “Equity
Financing.”
The obligation of each Equity Financing Source to fund its equity commitment will automatically and immediately
terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the consummation of the Closing, (b) the termination of the Equity
Commitment Letter of any other Equity Financing Source (other than in connection with the funding of the applicable
equity contribution thereunder), (c) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (d)
the full satisfaction of any final judgment against Parent in any action that includes an award of damages or the
payment of any amount due in connection with the Fee Funding Agreements and (e) the commencement by Zendesk
or any of its controlled affiliates of any lawsuit or other legal proceeding asserting any claim against any Equity
Financing Source or any of the Investor Parties (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letters) under, in respect of, or
relating to, the Merger Agreement, the Fee Funding Agreements or the Equity Commitment Letters or the
transactions contemplated thereby, subject to certain exceptions for permitted claims.
Zendesk is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters solely with respect to enforcing
Parent’s right to cause the commitments under the Equity Commitment Letters by the Equity Financing Sources be
funded to Parent in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters, and to cause Parent to enforce its rights against
such Equity Financing Source to perform its funding obligations under the applicable Equity Commitment Letter, in
each case subject to (a) the limitations and conditions set forth in each Equity Commitment Letter and (b) the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Debt Financing and Preferred Equity Financing
In addition, in connection with the Merger Agreement, (a) the Debt Commitment Parties have committed to provide
Parent with Debt Financing consisting of a $3.75 billion senior secured term loan facility, a senior secured delayed
draw term loan facility and a $350 million senior secured revolving credit facility, in each case on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, and (b) Parent has obtained commitments for
Preferred Equity Financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million from the Preferred Equity Financing
Sources on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter. The
obligations of the Debt Commitment Parties to provide Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Preferred Equity Financing Sources to provide Preferred Equity Financing under the Preferred Equity Commitment
Letter are, in each case, subject to a number of customary conditions, including consummation of the Merger. For
more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Debt Financing and
Preferred Equity Financing.”
Parent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts, and to cause each of its subsidiaries to use its reasonable best
efforts, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
71
TABLE OF CONTENTS
advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions described in the
Commitment Letters, as applicable (or, only if then available, on other terms (but not conditions), that (a) are
acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion and (b) would otherwise not contain any Prohibited Modification (as
defined in the Merger Agreement)) on the date on which the Merger is required to be consummated, pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement. Parent has agreed to comply with its obligations, and enforce its rights, under the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and, if then in effect and applicable, the
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing in a timely and diligent
manner. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Debt
Financing and Preferred Equity Financing.”
Zendesk is required to use its reasonable best efforts, and to cause its subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts,
and each of them to use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective subsidiaries and representatives to use
their reasonable best efforts, to provide customary cooperation, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent
necessary for the arrangement, consummation or issuance, as applicable, of the Debt Financing, Preferred Equity
Financing or any alternative financing obtained in accordance with the Merger Agreement (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Zendesk or any of its
affiliates), subject to certain exceptions. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger Agreement-Cooperation as to Debt Financing and Preferred Equity Financing.”
Fee Funding Agreements
Pursuant to the Fee Funding Agreements, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, each Equity
Financing Source has agreed to pay a portion of the payment of: (a) the aggregate amount of the Parent Termination
Fee solely if and when payable by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement; (b) certain enforcement and interest
expenses solely if and when payable by Parent in connection with certain legal proceedings and defaults under the
Merger Agreement; (c) any filing fees payable by Zendesk in connection with the notifications, filings, registrations
or other materials contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (d) certain reimbursement obligations solely if and
when payable by Parent pursuant to the indemnification obligations to Zendesk and its representatives in connection
with the Debt Financing. The obligations of the Equity Financing Sources under the respective Fee Funding
Agreements are subject to an aggregate cap equal to $637 million.
Subject to specified exceptions, each of the Fee Funding Agreements will terminate automatically and immediately
upon the earliest of:
•
the Closing, if the Closing occurs, and the payment of all amounts owed by Parent at the Closing pursuant
to the Merger Agreement; and
•
six months following the valid termination of the Merger Agreement if Zendesk has not made a claim in
writing for payment of any of the obligations set forth in clauses (a) through (d) above to Parent by such
date, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the Fee Funding Agreements.",72,82

If the Merger is consummated, Zendesk stockholders who continuously hold shares of Zendesk common stock
through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and properly demand
appraisal of their shares and otherwise comply with the statutory requirements of Section 262 of the
72TABLE OF CONTENTS
DGCL will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and
incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that Zendesk stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All
references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder,” “holder of shares of Zendesk common stock” or
“Zendesk stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of Zendesk common stock unless otherwise expressly
noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of Zendesk common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the
shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Zendesk common stock
held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker, fiduciary (such as a trustee, guardian or
custodian), depository or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps
summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Zendesk
common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should
consult with your bank, broker or other nominee.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, Zendesk stockholders who: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal
of their shares; (b) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (c) continuously are the record
holders of such shares through the Effective Time; and (d) otherwise exactly follow the procedures set forth in
Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive
payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Zendesk common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to
be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. However, after an appraisal petition has been
filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Zendesk stockholders who have
asserted appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and
perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock as measured in accordance with
subsection (g) of Section 262; or (ii) the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of
Zendesk common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million (conditions (i)
and (ii) which are referred to as the “ownership thresholds”). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its
discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound
quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any time before the
Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily
pay to each Zendesk stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in
which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if
any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The
Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, such as the Special
Meeting, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was
such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that
appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes
Zendesk’s notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text
of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with the Merger, any Zendesk
stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should
review this discussion and Annex D carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a
timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A Zendesk stockholder who
loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in the Merger
Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares
of Zendesk common stock, Zendesk believes that if a Zendesk stockholder considers exercising such rights, that
Zendesk stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Zendesk stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Zendesk common stock
must do ALL of the following:
•
the Zendesk stockholder must not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal;
73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the Zendesk stockholder must deliver to Zendesk a written demand for appraisal before the vote by the
Zendesk stockholders is taken on the Merger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting;
•
the Zendesk stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Zendesk common stock from the date of
making the demand through the Effective Time (a Zendesk stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the
Zendesk stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time); and
•
the Zendesk stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock
held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must
file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares
within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any
petition and has no intention of doing so.
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement, a Zendesk stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must
vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any Zendesk stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Zendesk, before the vote on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will
be submitted to Zendesk stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such Zendesk stockholder’s shares, and
that Zendesk stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A
Zendesk stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is
submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the Zendesk stockholder’s appraisal rights. Therefore, a
Zendesk stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy
containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting, or otherwise
fail to vote, on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement
nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself,
constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal
must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or
vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A Zendesk stockholder’s failure to
make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special
Meeting of Zendesk stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of Zendesk common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Zendesk common stock must be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform Zendesk of the identity of the holder
and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the Merger.
If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record
by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf
of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a
demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners
and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.

At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Zendesk stockholder who has delivered a written demand to
Zendesk and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may
withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering to Zendesk a written
withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days
after the Effective Time shall require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the
Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any Zendesk stockholder without the approval of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems just; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any Zendesk stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such Zendesk
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the Merger Consideration within 60 days after the Effective Time. If
an appraisal proceeding is commenced and Zendesk, as the Surviving Corporation, does not approve a request to
withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any Zendesk stockholder
who withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a Zendesk
stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal
proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Merger Consideration being offered pursuant
to the Merger Agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each
Zendesk stockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has
not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective
date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any Zendesk stockholder
who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any
beneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock held either in a voting trust or by nominee on behalf of such
person) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy
served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a Zendesk stockholder (or beneficial owner),
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting Zendesk stockholders entitled to
appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and
Zendesk stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any
negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Zendesk common stock. Accordingly, any Zendesk
stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal
rights in respect of their shares of Zendesk common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section
262. The failure of a Zendesk stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could
nullify the Zendesk stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any Zendesk stockholder who has complied with the requirements of
Section 262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from
the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Zendesk common stock not
voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Zendesk has received demands
for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail such
statement to the requesting Zendesk stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the Surviving
75
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery
of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock held either in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking
appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph. As noted above,
however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a Zendesk stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a Zendesk stockholder or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is served
upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to
file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all Zendesk
stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares
have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of
the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the Zendesk
stockholders shown on such verified list at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least
one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,
Delaware, or in another publication determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs of these notices are
borne by the Surviving Corporation. After notice to Zendesk stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware
Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those Zendesk stockholders who
have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require Zendesk stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates
(if any) to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any
Zendesk stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that Zendesk
stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all
Zendesk stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.
Determination of “Fair Value”
After determining the Zendesk stockholders entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds
described above has been satisfied as to Zendesk stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will
be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair
value” of the shares of Zendesk common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value
(subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 that have the effect of limiting the sum on which interest accrues as
described below). In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time
through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal
Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery
enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each Zendesk stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on
an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary
payment, unless paid at such time.
In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated
that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but
76
TABLE OF CONTENTS
which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,
may be considered.”
Zendesk stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they
would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an
investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is
not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as
to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and Zendesk
stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower
than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Zendesk nor Parent anticipates offering more than the
Merger Consideration to any Zendesk stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Zendesk and Parent
reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Zendesk common stock is less
than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds
described above has been satisfied as to Zendesk stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an
appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and
expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a Zendesk stockholder,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a Zendesk
stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and
expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all of the shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence
of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any Zendesk stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Zendesk common stock under Section
262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the Zendesk stockholder’s
shares of Zendesk common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. A Zendesk stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or
withdraw, such holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if
neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met or if the Zendesk stockholder properly delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of such holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no Zendesk stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote
such shares of Zendesk common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on
the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of Zendesk common stock, if any, payable to
Zendesk stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the
ownership thresholds described above is met, or if the Zendesk stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a
written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the
Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such Zendesk
stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery,
however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any Zendesk stockholder without the approval of the
court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not affect the right of any Zendesk stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such Zendesk stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept
the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a Zendesk
stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Zendesk stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights
is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",82,87

Ciccotelli v. Zendesk, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-06654 (filed August 5, 2022), were filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York. One complaint, captioned Butler v. Zendesk, Inc., et al., No. 3:22-cv-04414 (filed July
29, 2022), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaints name Zendesk and
its directors as defendants. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants filed or caused to be filed
a materially false and misleading preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the Merger in violation of
Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiffs seek as
relief, among other things, injunctive relief preventing defendants from filing a definitive proxy statement and from
consummating the Merger unless additional disclosures are made, rescission of the Merger in the event the Merger is
consummated or awarding of rescissory damages, relief directing the defendants to account to plaintiffs for all
damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations, and an award of costs and disbursements, including
reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses. On August 7, 2022, one purported Zendesk stockholder sent a
draft complaint, and another purported Zendesk stockholder sent a demand letter, each alleging to have identified
materially misleading and incomplete statements in the preliminary proxy statement.
Additionally, Zendesk received a demand letter dated August 5, 2022 on behalf of a purported Zendesk stockholder
pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL requesting to inspect certain of Zendesk’s books and records relating to, among
other things, the Merger.
Zendesk believes the claims asserted in each of the lawsuits, draft complaint and demand letters are without merit.
Additional lawsuits arising out of the Merger may also be filed in the future.",87,88
Zendesk MA.Pdf,Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that
may be relevant to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders (each, as defined below) of shares of Zendesk common stock
whose shares of Zendesk common stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This
discussion is limited to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders who hold their shares of Zendesk common stock as
“capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This
discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published
positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on
the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time,
possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the
statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or
that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax considerations described in this discussion. No
advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed below.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the
U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and
circumstances, or to Zendesk stockholders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including,
for example:
•
banks and other financial institutions;
•
mutual funds;
•
insurance companies;
•
brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
•
dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of
Zendesk common stock;
•
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
•
retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;
•
tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations
and pension funds;
78TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
holders that hold shares of Zendesk common stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or
other integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions;
•
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
Partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S
corporations,” or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such
entities);
•
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Zendesk common
stock (by vote or value);
•
holders that received their shares of Zendesk common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-
qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
•
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
holders that own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger; and
•
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to Zendesk
common stock as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.
This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax
(such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or foreign income or non-income tax
considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations arising under the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the alternative
minimum tax or any considerations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection
therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement).
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a
beneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and
certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of Zendesk
common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY
PARTICULAR ZENDESK STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE ZENDESK STOCKHOLDER’S
PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO
THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX
CONSEQUENCES.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Zendesk common stock that is
for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless
of its source; or
•
a trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration
of such trust and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United
States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Zendesk common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or
arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Zendesk common stock pursuant to the Merger will be
a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
in the shares of Zendesk common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Zendesk common stock. A U.S. Holder’s
gain or loss on the disposition of shares of Zendesk common stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or
loss. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such
shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-
corporate holders, including individuals, currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Zendesk common
stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period
separately with respect to each block of Zendesk common stock.
Non-U.S. Holders
In general, subject to the discussion below regarding potential backup withholding, the receipt of cash by a non-U.S.
Holder in exchange for shares of Zendesk common stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to United States
federal income tax unless:
•
the gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with a trade or business of the
non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to
the non-U.S. Holder’s permanent establishment in the United States);
•
the non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of the exchange of shares of Zendesk common stock pursuant to the Merger and certain other
conditions are met; or
•
shares of Zendesk common stock constitute a United States real property interest by reason of Zendesk’s
status as a “United States real property holding corporation” within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code (which we refer to as “USRPHC”) at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the
date of the Effective Time or the period that the non-U.S. Holder held the applicable shares of Zendesk
common stock (which we refer to as the “Relevant Period”).
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to United States federal income tax on a net
income basis in substantially the same manner as if the non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder (unless an applicable
income tax treaty provides otherwise), and if the non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, it may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be
provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on its “effectively connected earnings and profits” for the taxable year,
as adjusted for certain items.
A non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of
30% (or such lower rate as may be provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on any gain recognized, which may
be offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year (if any).
With respect to the third bullet point above, Zendesk believes it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC
during the five-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time. Even if Zendesk is or was a USRPHC during the
relevant period, gain arising from a non-U.S. Holder’s receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Zendesk common
stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the Zendesk common stock is “regularly
traded,” as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. Holder
owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of the Zendesk common stock throughout the Relevant Period.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders and non-
U.S. Holders in connection with the Merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder
pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a
80
TABLE OF CONTENTS
properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct taxpayer identification number
and certifying that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and
otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.
A non-U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax (currently, at a rate of 24%)
unless the non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS
Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such non-U.S. Holder’s status
as a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder
or a non-U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s or non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder or non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY

Zendesk MA.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed to (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement) use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, and to do
promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals, registrations,
waivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from governmental entities as described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Other Covenants-Efforts to Consummate the
Merger.” These approvals include clearances under the HSR Act, the CFIUS Approval and regulatory approvals
under the laws of certain other jurisdictions, including the EU.
U.S. Regulatory Clearances
Under the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger has expired or
been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day
waiting period following the parties’ filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. The parties made the
required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on July 1, 2022, and the 30-day waiting period expired on August 1, 2022.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary
or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take
such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could
include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.
Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be
certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties have received from the interagency
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (which we refer to as “CFIUS”): (a) a written determination
from CFIUS to the effect that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement do not constitute a “covered
transaction” pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 800.213, (b) a written determination from CFIUS to the effect that review or
investigation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has been concluded and that a
determination has been made that there are no unresolved national security concerns, or (c) following an
investigation conducted by CFIUS pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 800.507, CFIUS reports the
81TABLE OF CONTENTS
transaction to the President of the United States and either (i) the President of the United States makes a decision not
to suspend or prohibit such transaction pursuant to his authorities under Section 721 of the Defense Production Act
of 1950, 50 U.S.C. § 4565, as amended, and the regulations at 31 C.F.R. Parts 800-802, or (ii) the President of the United
States has not taken any action within 15 days from the date he received the report from CFIUS (which we refer to as
the “CFIUS Approval”). Zendesk and Parent submitted a draft joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on July 18, 2022.
Other Regulatory Clearances
The Merger is also subject to receipt of pending regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions (unless excluded
by waiver mutually agreed between the parties to the Merger Agreement) under their applicable regulatory laws as
amended from time to time, in particular: Austria (pursuant to the Austrian Cartel Act 2005); the European Union
(pursuant to the Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004); South Africa (pursuant to the South African Competition Act
No. 89 of 1998); Spain (pursuant to the Spanish Act on the legal regime of capital movements and economic
transactions abroad (the Act 19.2003) as per last amendment of 24 June 2021 (Royal Decree Law 12/2021) and
amended by the transitional provisions (Royal Decree 27/2021); and Switzerland (pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act
on Cartels and Other Restrictions of Competition of 1995 and Ordinance of the Control of Concentrations of
Undertakings of 1996).
In each case, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties obtain clearance or approval to consummate the
Merger or the applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated. The parties have agreed to cooperate with
each other and use their reasonable best efforts to make these filings as promptly as reasonably practicable. The
relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary
or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or
hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Zendesk, Parent, Merger Sub or
the holders of any securities of Zendesk or Merger Sub, each share of Zendesk common stock (other than the

withholding.
Treatment of Zendesk Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time: RSU Awards and Stock Options that are vested as of

representing shares of Zendesk common stock (which we refer to as “certificates”) and non-certificated shares of
Zendesk common stock represented by book-entry (which we refer to as “book-entry shares”). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding amounts payable through Zendesk’s or its subsidiaries’ payroll systems)
in exchange for all shares of Zendesk common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Unconverted Shares) (which we refer to as the “Payment Fund”). The Paying Agent will invest all cash included
in the Payment Fund as reasonably directed by Parent, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Merger
Agreement and provided that any loss of any of the funds included in the Payment Fund will not alter Parent’s
obligations to pay the Merger Consideration. In the event the Payment Fund is insufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration (excluding amounts payable through Zendesk’s or its subsidiaries’ payroll systems) for all
shares of Zendesk common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Unconverted
Shares), Parent will promptly deposit (or cause to be deposited) additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount
that is equal to the shortfall required to make such payment.
84TABLE OF CONTENTS
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event not later than the second business day
following the Effective Time), the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record of shares of Zendesk common stock
(other than holders of Unconverted Shares) whose shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the Merger Agreement (a) a letter of transmittal in such form as Parent and Zendesk may mutually agree (or an online
portal for holders of record with valid email addresses if the Paying Agent does not customarily require a letter of
transmittal) and (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates or book-entry shares in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. The amount of any Merger Consideration paid to Zendesk stockholders may be reduced
by any applicable withholding taxes.
Upon surrender of certificates or book-entry shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal (if
required), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such certificates or book-entry shares
(other than holders of Unconverted Shares) will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the number of shares of Zendesk common stock formerly represented by such holder’s properly
surrendered certificates or book-entry shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject to all required tax
withholding.
In the case of any certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate an amount in cash (after giving effect to any tax withholding as provided
in the Merger Agreement) equal to (x) the number of shares of Zendesk common stock formerly represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.
Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to
Zendesk stockholders for one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon
demand, and any Zendesk stockholder who has not surrendered its shares of Zendesk common stock in accordance
with the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, without any interest, upon due surrender of their shares of Zendesk common stock.
Withholding",94,95

Each of the Paying Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and Parent are entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration and any other payments otherwise payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any person
such amount as they are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that any amounts are withheld and properly paid to
the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts will be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

•
any reduction in the credit rating of the United States;
provided that if any of the developments, occurrences, events, effects, circumstances or changes in the first through

•
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to the submission or announcement of, or constitute any
Alternative Proposal (as defined below in this section of this proxy statement);
•
enter into or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party (other than
Parent and its representatives) regarding, or furnish any nonpublic information or access to any third party
(other than Parent and its representatives) with respect to, any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal (other than
supplying nonpublic information in the ordinary course of business in a manner that is not reasonably
expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal);
•
engage in discussions with any third party (other than Parent and its representatives) that has made or, to
the knowledge of Zendesk, is considering making an Alternative Proposal (except to notify any person of
the existence of the restrictions on solicitation of Alternative Proposals set forth in the Merger Agreement),
in each case for the purpose of knowingly, or that would reasonably be expected to be, facilitating,
inducing or encouraging an Alternative Proposal; or
•
enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any Alternative
Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements as permitted below).
Zendesk agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries, directors or officers to, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause
their other respective representatives to, promptly after execution of the Merger Agreement cease any solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any third party (other than Parent and its representatives) with respect to an
Alternative Proposal or potential Alternative Proposal and promptly after execution of the Merger Agreement
terminate access granted to any third party or its representatives (other than Parent and its representatives) to any
nonpublic information of Zendesk or its subsidiaries within the control of Zendesk or its subsidiaries or electronic
data room maintained by Zendesk or its subsidiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or an Alternative Proposal and request that all nonpublic information previously provided be returned or
destroyed in accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Merger Agreement to the contrary, the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may grant a waiver of any
standstill provisions in any agreement with any person to permit such person to make an Alternative Proposal
privately and confidentially to the Board of Directors.
If Zendesk receives an Alternative Proposal prior to obtaining the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Zendesk
stockholders that did not result from a material breach of its non-solicitation obligations under the Merger
Agreement, (a) Zendesk and its representatives may contact the third party making such Alternative Proposal to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof or inform such person of the existence of non-solicitation obligations under
the Merger Agreement or (b) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
90TABLE OF CONTENTS
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, such Alternative Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal (as defined below in this section of this proxy statement) or would reasonably be expected to lead
to or result in a Superior Proposal, Zendesk may take the following actions:
•
furnish nonpublic information to the third party (including its representatives) making such Alternative
Proposal, if, prior to so furnishing such information, Zendesk receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement containing provisions that are not less favorable in any material respect to
Zendesk than those contained in Zendesk’s confidentiality agreements with Permira Advisers LLC, Hellman
& Friedman Advisors LLC and certain other parties thereto (provided that Zendesk must substantially
concurrently (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter) provide to Parent any nonpublic information
concerning Zendesk or any of its subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
representatives unless such nonpublic information has been previously provided or made available to
Parent or its representatives); and
•
engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party and its representatives with respect to the
Alternative Proposal.
Zendesk must promptly (within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Alternative Proposal
and will, in any such written notice to Parent, include copies of any written materials relating to such Alternative
Proposal (including materials provided by Zendesk in response thereto) and indicate the identity of the person
making such proposal and the material terms and conditions of such proposal and thereafter will promptly (within 24
hours) keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material change to the terms of any
such Alternative Proposal, including by providing a copy of all additional written documentation relating thereto.
“Alternative Proposal” means any bona fide, written proposal or offer from any third party relating to (a) a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction
involving Zendesk as a result of which the Zendesk stockholders immediately prior to such transaction would cease
to own at least 80% of the fully diluted total voting power of Zendesk or any surviving entity (or any direct or
indirect parent company thereof) immediately following such transaction, (b) a tender offer or exchange offer or other
transaction which, if consummated, would result in a direct or indirect acquisition by such third party of more than
20% of the fully diluted total voting power represented by the outstanding voting securities of Zendesk or any of its
subsidiaries whose assets constitute over 20% of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of Zendesk and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (c) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by such third party of over
20% of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of Zendesk and its subsidiaries, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
“Superior Proposal” means a written Alternative Proposal that was not solicited in material breach of Zendesk’s non-
solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement (a) made by any third party on terms that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with Zendesk’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is more
favorable to Zendesk stockholders (in their capacities as such) from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, taking into account the financial, legal, regulatory, conditionality and other
aspects of such proposal and any irrevocable written proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the Merger
Agreement as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-The Board of Directors’ Recommendation;

Zendesk MA.Pdf,The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation,"The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation
As described in this proxy statement, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made
the recommendation that the Zendesk stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal. The Merger
Agreement provides that the Board of Directors will not effect a Change of Recommendation (as defined below in this
section of this proxy statement), except as described below.
The Board of Directors has agreed that it will not:
•
fail to make, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or resolve
to or publicly propose to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub, its recommendation that Zendesk stockholders vote for the Merger Agreement Proposal;
•
approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement providing for any Alternative
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as described above in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “-Restrictions on Solicitations of Alternative Proposals”);
•
fail to issue a press release publicly reaffirming its recommendation that Zendesk stockholders vote for the
Merger Agreement Proposal in response to an Alternative Proposal that has been publicly disclosed within
10 business days after a request by Parent to do so;
•
fail to include its recommendation that Zendesk stockholders vote for the Merger Agreement Proposal in
the Proxy Statement;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm its recommendation that Zendesk stockholders vote for the Merger Agreement
Proposal after the commencement of any third-party tender offer or exchange offer of an Alternative
Proposal structured as such pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act within 10 business days after
commencement of such offer after a request by Parent to do so; or
•
approve, endorse or recommend, or resolve to or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Alternative Proposal or submit any Alternative Proposal to a vote of Zendesk stockholders (any of the
actions itemized in this bullet and the preceding five bullets, which we refer to as a “Change of
Recommendation”).
For each of the third and fifth bullets above, Zendesk is not required to reaffirm its recommendation that Zendesk
stockholders vote for the Merger Agreement Proposal more than once per Alternative Proposal unless the terms of
such Alternative Proposal change in any material respects and such change is publicly announced or disclosed.
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the following shall constitute a Change of Recommendation: (a) the private
determination by the Board of Directors that an Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (b) a public
press release as to the determination described in clause (a) so long as such press release also states that no Change
of Recommendation or termination of the Merger Agreement will occur until the expiration of the applicable Match
Period (as defined below in this section of this proxy statement) has occurred and promptly after the end of such
Match Period Zendesk either (i) issues a public press release stating that the prior Alternative Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) makes a Change of Recommendation or terminates the Merger Agreement
pursuant to the Superior Proposal Termination Right or (c) the delivery by Zendesk to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective representatives of the notices described in this section of this proxy statement and the section of this
proxy statement entitled “-Restrictions on Solicitations of Alternative Proposals,” (d) a disclosure that constitutes
only a “stop, look and listen” statement or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or (e) a public statement that describes Zendesk’s receipt of an Alternative Proposal, the Board of
Directors is considering the Alternative Proposal, no position has been taken by the Board of Directors as to the
advisability or desirability of such Alternative Proposal and the operation of the Merger Agreement with respect
thereto.
At any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Zendesk stockholders, in response to an Alternative
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of Zendesk’s non-solicitation obligations under the Merger
Agreement, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that (a) such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (b) the
92TABLE OF CONTENTS
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law, then the Board of Directors may: (i) effect a Change of Recommendation; and/or (ii) cause Zendesk to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the Superior Proposal Termination Right and substantially concurrently enter into
a definitive agreement with respect such Superior Proposal; provided that prior to taking any such action:
•
Zendesk provides Parent four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action (it
being understood that each time any material revision or amendment to the terms of the Alternative
Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal is made, including any revision or amendment to the
financial terms, written notice to Parent will be required and the four-business day period will be extended
for an additional two business days after notification of such change to Parent);
•
during the applicable period described in the bullet above (which we refer to as a “Match Period”), Zendesk
considers and discusses with Parent in good faith any adjustments or modifications to the terms of the
Merger Agreement proposed by Parent; and
•
at the end of the Match Period, the Board of Directors again makes the determination in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and after taking into account any
adjustments or modifications proposed by Parent during the period contemplated by the first bullet above),
that the Alternative Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal.
The Board of Directors may, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Zendesk stockholders,
effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to the first, third and fourth bullets of the definition of “Change of
Recommendation” in this section of this proxy statement above in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in
this section of this proxy statement below) if:
•
Zendesk provides Parent four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which
notice must identify and include all material information with respect to such Intervening Event and a
description of the Board of Directors’ rationale for such action;
•
during such 4-business day period described in the bullet above (also referred to as a “Match Period”),
Zendesk considers and discusses in good faith with Parent any adjustments or modifications to the terms
of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent; and

at the end of the Match Period, the Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel (after taking into account any adjustments or modifications to
the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent during the period described in the first bullet
above) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law.
“Intervening Event” means a material fact, event, occurrence, development, change or change in circumstances that
was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of June 24, 2022 (or if known to the Board of
Directors as of June 24, 2022, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of
Directors as of June 24, 2022) and becomes known to the Board of Directors prior to the time the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by Zendesk stockholders is obtained; provided, however, that none of the following will
constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been, an Intervening Event: (a) the receipt, existence of
or terms of an Alternative Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof and (b) changes in the
market price or trading volume of Zendesk common stock or the fact that Zendesk meets or exceeds internal or
published projections, budgets, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial results for any period

For one year following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will provide to each employee of
Zendesk and its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or any of its affiliates (which we refer to, each,
as a “Company Employee”):
•
an annual base salary or wage rate at least equal to the annual base salary or wage rate provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;

•
target cash incentive bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than the target cash incentive bonus
opportunities provided to such Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
•
other compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to
the other compensation opportunities and employee benefits provided to such Company Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case without regard to any retention, change in control,
stay, transaction, or similar non-routine compensation or compensation opportunities, or equity or equity-
based compensation); and
•
for each Company Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or one of its subsidiaries
(including Zendesk) within such year, severance payments and benefits that are no less favorable than the
Zendesk severance payments and benefits in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement.

participates in a 2022 bonus plan a bonus, and otherwise earned in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
2022 bonus plan (including any condition of continued employment). Any elections made by a Zendesk employee to
receive a bonus pursuant to any 2022 bonus plan in the form of Zendesk common stock or an equity or equity-based
award will automatically be deemed void as of the Effective Time, and each such bonus, to the extent earned, will be
paid in cash to such eligible Zendesk employee.

incorporation and bylaws or similar organization documents in effect as of June 24, 2022, and will not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of Zendesk or any of its subsidiaries

and stand surety for, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, each of the covenants described in this section of this proxy statement.
In addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing upon an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is reasonably determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification)
each current and former director or officer of Zendesk or any of its subsidiaries and each person who served as a
director, officer or other fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or another legal
entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of Zendesk (which we refer to, each, in his or her capacity
as such, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators, as an “indemnified party”) against any costs

claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each indemnified party to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative

alleged to have occurred on or before the Effective Time in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director or other fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan or another entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of Zendesk. In the event of any such action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will reasonably cooperate
with the indemnified party in the defense of any such action.
In addition, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by Zendesk and its subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that after the Effective Time, Parent will not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid by Zendesk prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement in respect of such coverages,
but in such case must purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. At Parent’s option,

without limitation, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided that the premium for such
“tail” policy shall not exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid by Zendesk prior to the execution of the Merger

Each of Zendesk and Parent has agreed to, and to cause its affiliates to:
•
consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any filings, notifications, communications,
submissions, and any other actions with a governmental entity in connection with the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and give the other party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection
with, any proposed communication to any governmental entity;
•
subject to applicable law and the instructions of any governmental entity, keep each other apprised on a
current basis of the status of matters relating to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of communications received
by Zendesk or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective affiliates, from any governmental entity
or private party with respect to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; and

to the extent not prohibited by the applicable governmental entity or private party, as the case may be, give
each other the opportunity to attend and participate in any meetings (whether in-person or otherwise),
telephone or video calls or other conferences.
Any party to the Merger Agreement may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably (x) redact materials to
protect competitively sensitive information or information concerning valuation, to comply with contractual
agreements or to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and (y) designate materials as “outside
counsel only” (such materials and the information contained therein to be given only to the outside legal counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient,
unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the party providing the materials). Parent will direct
and control communications and strategy relating to obtaining all consents and other approvals contemplated or
required by the Merger Agreement following consultation with (and considering in good faith the views of) Zendesk.
All filing fees payable in connection with the notifications, filings, registrations or other materials contemplated by

property, business or person (by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, investment, other business
combination, asset, stock or equity purchase, or otherwise), or enter into any contract or take any other actions, that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay obtaining, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
consent of any governmental entity or the receipt thereof in a manner that would or would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or cause either of the conditions listed in the
second and third bullets of the first set of bullets in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Conditions to the
Closing of the Merger” to not be satisfied, in each case prior to the End Date, or increase in any material respect the
risk of any governmental entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby which would prevent the satisfaction of either of the conditions listed in the second and third bullets of the
first set of bullets in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.”
Each party has also agreed to promptly inform the other party of any oral communication with, and provide copies of
written communications with, CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency regarding CFIUS filings (with the exception of
communications containing a party’s confidential business information if such confidential information is unrelated
to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement). The parties have agreed to undertake best efforts to
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action, and do, or cause to be done all things necessary or advisable to obtain
CFIUS Approval as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, however, no party is required to take
or agree to take any undertaking that is not conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by

Zendesk MA.Pdf,Specific Enforcement,"Specific Enforcement
Subject to the limitations described in this section of this proxy statement, the parties have agreed that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the parties do not perform the provisions of the Merger Agreement (or the Equity Commitment Letters or Fee
Funding Agreements) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach or threaten to breach such
provisions. The parties have acknowledged and agreed that, subject to the limitations described in this section of
this proxy statement, and, with respect to any monetary damages, the section of this proxy statement entitled “-
Limitations of Liability,” they will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of the Merger Agreement without proof of actual damages or the inadequacy of monetary relief, in
addition to any other remedies at law or in equity.
Zendesk will be entitled to specific performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations pursuant to the terms of
the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letters to consummate the Closing, including to cause Parent and
Merger Sub to exercise their rights under the Equity Commitment Letters, to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
and to consummate the Merger, if, and only in the event if (and for the avoidance of doubt, in no other
circumstances): (a) all of (i) Zendesk’s, Parent’s and Merger Sub’s mutual conditions to the Closing and (ii) Parent’s
and Merger Sub’s conditions to the Closing, each as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-
Conditions to the Closing of the Merger,” have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such
specific performance) or waived by Parent, (b) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Closing and
Effective Time,” (c) the Debt Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing has been funded or will be funded at the
Closing if the equity financing is funded at the Closing, and (d) Zendesk has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Parent that if specific performance were granted and the Financing were funded, then the Closing would occur as
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Closing and Effective Time.”
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (a) there is adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an order or injunction
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger
Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.
The parties have further agreed that (a) by seeking the remedies described in this section of this proxy statement
prior to the valid termination of the Merger Agreement, a party will not in any respect waive its right to seek at any
time any other form of relief that may be available to a party under the Merger Agreement, the Commitment Letters or
the Fee Funding Agreements, and (b) nothing will require any party to the Merger Agreement to institute any action
for (or limit any party’s right to institute any action for) specific performance prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under the Merger Agreement (and pursuing damages before or after such termination), nor will the
commencement of any legal proceeding or otherwise restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms or pursue any other remedies under the Merger Agreement, the Commitment
Letters or the Fee Funding Agreements that may be

available then or thereafter (subject in each case the terms, limitations and conditions set forth therein); provided that
the parties to the Merger Agreement have acknowledged and agreed that, while Zendesk may pursue a grant of
specific performance prior to the valid termination of the Merger Agreement, following a valid termination of the
Merger Agreement, under no circumstances would Zendesk be permitted or entitled to seek a grant of specific
performance to cause the Closing to occur or to enforce any provision of the Merger Agreement which does not
survive such termination; provided that Zendesk may continue any ongoing action for specific performance filed
prior to a purported termination of the Merger Agreement, subject to the limitations therein.

Zendesk MA.Pdf,PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL,"PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Zendesk is required to
submit a proposal to Zendesk stockholders to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to Zendesk’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Compensation Proposal). This
compensation is summarized in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Interests of
Zendesk’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.” The Board of Directors encourages you to review
carefully the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.
Accordingly, Zendesk is asking you to approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Zendesk approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that
will or may become payable to Zendesk’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement-Interests of Zendesk’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Agreement
Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve the
Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not
be binding on Zendesk. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed,
the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the
vote on this Compensation Proposal.
Approval, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the
outstanding shares of Zendesk common stock properly cast for the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting,
provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special
Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (b) abstentions will have no effect on the
outcome of the Compensation Proposal and (c) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the
Compensation Proposal. Shares of Zendesk common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and
unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a Zendesk stockholder
returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Zendesk
common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a
quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or
appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting (the Adjournment Proposal). If Zendesk stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to
solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from Zendesk stockholders that have previously returned
properly executed proxies voting against the Merger Agreement Proposal. Among other things, approval of the
Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes
against Merger Agreement Proposal such that the Merger Agreement Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn
the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those
shares to change their votes to votes in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal. Additionally, we may seek to
adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special
Meeting.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal (a) when a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares of Zendesk common stock properly cast for the Adjournment Proposal, and (b) when a quorum is not present,
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of Zendesk common stock representing a majority of the voting
power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect
on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal, (b) abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment
Proposal and (c) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. If a
quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
Shares of Zendesk common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be
voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a Zendesk stockholder returns a signed proxy card
without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Zendesk common stock represented by that
proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and
all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.

outstanding Zendesk common stock;
•
each of our directors;
•

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future
meetings of Zendesk stockholders. However, if the Merger is not completed, Zendesk stockholders will continue to
be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
After the 2022 annual meeting of Zendesk stockholders (which we refer to as the “2022 annual meeting”) scheduled
for August 17, 2022, there will be no annual meetings of Zendesk stockholders if the Merger is completed.
As described in our annual proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting filed on July 11, 2022, Zendesk stockholders
had the opportunity to submit proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration at the 2022
annual meeting by submitting their proposals in writing to our Corporate Secretary in a timely manner by June 19,
2022, and otherwise complying with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.
In addition, our bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to business to be brought before an
annual meeting, including stockholder proposals not included in our proxy statement. For director nominations or
other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of Zendesk stockholders by a Zendesk stockholder,
such Zendesk stockholder’s written notice must be received by Zendesk’s Corporate Secretary at the principal
executive offices of Zendesk not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day prior to the one-year anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. If the annual
meeting of Zendesk stockholders is first convened more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such
anniversary date, or if no annual meeting of Zendesk stockholders was held in the preceding year, notice by the
Zendesk stockholder to be timely must be received by our Corporate Secretary not later than the close of business on
the later of the 90th day prior to the scheduled date of such annual meeting of Zendesk stockholders or the 10th day
following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.

Board of Directors

Members of the Board:
We understand that Zendesk, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Zoro BidCo, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“Parent”), and Zoro Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (“Merger Sub”), plan to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated as of
June 24, 2022, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the
“Merger”). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the
Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger (such shares, collectively, “Company Common Stock” or “Shares” and each, a “Share”), other than (i) each
Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or its Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in the Merger
Agreement), including Merger Sub, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger or held by the Company or
its wholly owned subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (in each case, other than any such
Shares held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of third parties), (ii) Dissenting Shares (as such
term is defined in the Merger Agreement) and (iii) Shares underlying or comprising unexercised, unvested or
unsettled Company Equity Awards (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $77.50 in cash, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”), subject to any required Tax (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) withholding as
provided in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger
Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the “Holders”), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated June 23, 2022
(the “Draft Merger Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and
other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information
relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial projections and operating
data of the Company (the “Company Projections”). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and
financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed
the historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance
of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock with that of certain other selected
publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly
available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information
and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed
with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the
Company, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of Directors of the Company,
that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered
thereby. We express no view as to the Company Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. We have
assumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the final executed Merger
Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in

accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition,
we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no
delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or
the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have
we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent
verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and
products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our
services, a portion of which will become payable upon delivery of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger
fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us
for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material
relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company or Parent pursuant to which
compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except that Qatalyst Partners has provided financial
advisory services to Permira and received a fee of $15 million in connection with such services. Qatalyst Partners
and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or
Parent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,
domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these
activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise
effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.
This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion
is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without
our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how to vote with respect to the

as principal for its own account, consisting of the purchase by the Company of capped call options with respect to
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Convertible Notes (with approximately

Co. LLC in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Convertible Notes and approximately 2,114,712 shares of
Company Common Stock underlying the capped call options purchased from Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC in
connection with the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The Capped Call Transactions may be adjusted,
exercised, cancelled and/or terminated in accordance with their terms in connection with certain events, including the
announcement or consummation of the Transaction. In particular, under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions,
each of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and the other counterparties, each acting separately as calculation agent under
the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, is entitled in certain circumstances to make adjustments to the
exercise price and/or cap price of the embedded call options sold by the Company to Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and
the other counterparties to reflect the economic effect of the announcement of the Transaction on the Capped Call
Transactions. In its capacity as calculation agent, all actions or exercises of judgment by Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
pursuant to the terms of the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party must be performed in good faith and a
commercially reasonable manner.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to
stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2021;

stockholders; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company (including a schedule of expected
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards by the Company), prepared by its management, as approved for our

the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Company Common
Stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company

with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial
terms of certain recent business combinations in the software industry and in other industries; and performed such
other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed
with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we

currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet
assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected
benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We also have assumed that the Transaction will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition
the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor
does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Company Common Stock, as of the date
hereof, of the $77.50 cash per share of Company Common Stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the
Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the
Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the
Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the Transaction
to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or
other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid
or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection
with the Transaction, whether relative to the $77.50 in cash per share of Company Common Stock to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Agreement or
otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Company Common Stock will
trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company,
Parent or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or
Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is
necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this
opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and
the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the
Company in connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote with respect to such
Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co.
LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $77.50 in cash per share of
Company Common Stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and
its affiliates) of shares of Company Common Stock.

Zendesk MA.Pdf,Effect on Capital Stock,"Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:
(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares, collectively, “Company
Common Stock” or “Shares” and each, a “Share”) (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled or converted pursuant to
Section 2.1(b), (ii) Dissenting Shares, and (iii) for the avoidance of doubt, Shares underlying or comprising
unexercised, unvested or unsettled Company Equity Awards (“Unconverted Shares”)) shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $77.50 in cash, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”), subject to any required Tax withholding as provided in Section 2.3(b)(iii). As of the Effective
Time, all Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Section 2.1 shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive
the Merger Consideration with respect to each such Share.
(b) Parent, Merger Sub and Subsidiary-Owned Shares. Each Share that is issued and outstanding and owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, immediately prior to the Effective Time
or held by the Company or its wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case,
other than any such Shares held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of third parties) (the
“Cancelled Shares”) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.
(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1)
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and the shares so converted shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

(d) Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the
DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL
(the “Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead,
at the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws, waives or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (it being
understood that at the Effective Time such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding). If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws, waives or loses such right, such
Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable
for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a),
without any interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such Share or the transfer
of such Book-Entry Share, as applicable. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in
the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisals of Shares (and of any withdrawals of such demands) and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such
demand and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices
and demands. Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands after the date hereof until the Effective
Time. The Company shall not, and shall not agree to, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, voluntary offer to settle, or settle or compromise rights with
respect to any such demands.
(e) Adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately,
without duplication, to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this
Section 2.1(e) shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, with the aggregate amount
of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash hereinafter referred
to as the “Option Consideration”), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the
Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax law with respect to the making of such payment. Each
Company Stock Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not an In-
the-Money Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled as of the Effective Time
for no consideration.
(ii) Company Stock-Based Awards. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock-Based Award that is vested
by its terms and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or
award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, shall be canceled, and shall entitle the holder
thereof to the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, without interest, at the Effective Time an
amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each Share underlying a particular
Company Stock-Based Award (the aggregate amount of such cash, together with
A-3TABLE OF CONTENTS

less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state
or local Tax law with respect to the making of such payment.
(iii) Conversion to Cash Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each In-the-Money Company
Stock Option and Company Stock-Based Award that is then outstanding and not vested by its terms shall
be canceled and converted as of the Effective Time into a Cash Award (assuming achievement of
performance for performance-based Company Stock-Based Awards using the same formula provided for in
the applicable award agreement). Such Cash Award shall remain subject to the same time-vesting terms and
conditions that applied to the associated Company Stock Option or Company Stock-Based Award, as

including the requirement of continued service with the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates through the
applicable vesting date or through the end of the original performance period, as applicable, and the

withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payment, on the next payroll date following the applicable vesting dates, so long as the
applicable portion of the Cash Award became or becomes vested prior to the applicable holder’s
termination of service with the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates.
(iv) Payment of Equity Award Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent that sufficient
funds are not available at the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, deposit the Equity Award Consideration
(or funds sufficient to make up any shortfall) with the Company for the benefit of the holders of Company
Stock Options and Company Stock-Based Awards, and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay the Equity Award Consideration to such holders through its
payroll system as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days) following the
Effective Time.
(v) Board Action for Company Equity Awards and Cash Awards. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting that are necessary for the treatment
of the Company Equity Awards and the Cash Awards pursuant to Section 2.2 and will not adopt any
resolutions or take any other action to accelerate the vesting of the Company Stock Options or the
Company Stock-Based Awards.

two (2) Business Days), the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering
the Company’s 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”)) shall adopt resolutions or take action by
written consent in lieu of a meeting as necessary to provide that, with respect to the ESPP, (i) the ESPP shall be
suspended such that no new offering periods will commence following the date of this Agreement and no
changes or elections can be made after the date hereof, (ii) each offering period in effect as of the date hereof
will end on the earlier of its regular end date and fourteen (14) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, (iii) the

thereafter, and (iv) the Company will promptly refund all participant contributions remaining in the ESPP after
processing the purchase of Company Common Stock with respect to each offering period in effect as of the date
hereof.

Parent and the Company) (the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares (other than
the Cancelled Shares, Unconverted Shares or Dissenting Shares), cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the Cancelled Shares, Unconverted Shares
A-4TABLE OF CONTENTS
and Dissenting Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares (“Certificates”) (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund”). The Paying Agent shall also act as the agent for the applicable
Company Stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and
shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Equity Award Consideration will not be deposited with the Paying Agent and will be paid in
accordance with Section 2.2. In the event the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the shortfall that is required to make such
payment. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent
shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund in accordance with this Agreement
and the Company shall direct its transfer agent to deliver a final record holders list to the Paying Agent at least
one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing (the “Final Record Holder List”).
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second
(2nd) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent and otherwise shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may mutually agree) (provided that if the Paying Agent does not customarily require a letter of
transmittal with respect to Book-Entry Shares or utilizes an online portal for holders of record with valid
email addresses, no letter of transmittal shall be required to be mailed to such holders), and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates to the Paying Agent (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal (if required), duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other
than holders of Cancelled Shares, Unconverted Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares
formerly represented by such holder’s properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject to all required Tax
withholding as provided in Section 2.3(b)(iii) The Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if
required by Parent, an indemnity bond) so surrendered or the Book-Entry Share shall be forthwith
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. In the event that any transfer or other similar Taxes become payable by reason of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, or otherwise
because of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder, cash in U.S. dollars to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid with
respect to such Shares if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence, to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent, that any such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
(iii) Each of Parent, the Paying Agent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation (without duplication)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement, such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any provision of U.S. state or local
or non-U.S. Tax law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
A-5
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such
withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
(c) Closing of Transfer Books. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares, Unconverted Shares or Dissenting Shares)
are validly presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, as provided in this Article 2. The Company shall execute a letter of
termination conditioned on the Closing with its transfer agent at or prior to the Effective Time.
(d) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not
surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due
surrender of their Shares.
(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 upon surrender of any
Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. If any
Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.3(g)) or Book-Entry Shares shall not have
been surrendered or transferred, as applicable, prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration, pursuant to
this Article 2, would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Payment Fund as
reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government. Any loss of any of the funds included in the Payment Fund shall be for the account of Parent and
shall not alter Parent’s obligations to pay the Merger Consideration. Any amounts in the Payment Fund in
excess of the amount required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and shall promptly be paid to
Parent (or such other person as Parent may designate).
(g) Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as Parent or the Paying
Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate an amount in cash in U.S.
dollars (after giving effect to any Tax withholding as provided in Section 2.3(b)(iii)) equal to (x) the number of
Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration.

investigation shall be conducted under reasonable supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company and in
such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal business or operations of the Company or its

Subsidiaries, or any director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,

expected to constitute or lead to the submission or announcement of, or constitute any Alternative Proposal, (ii)
enter into or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party (other than Parent and
Parent’s Representatives) regarding, or furnish any nonpublic information or access to any third party (other

that would reasonably be expected to be, facilitating, inducing or encouraging an Alternative Proposal or (iv)
enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal

Subsidiaries, directors or officers to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their other respective
Representatives to, promptly cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any third party (other
than Parent and Parent’s Representatives) with respect to an Alternative Proposal or potential Alternative
Proposal and promptly terminate access granted to any third party or its Representatives (other than Parent and
Parent’s Representatives) to any non-public information of the Company or its Subsidiaries within the control of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or electronic data room maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an Alternative Proposal and request that all non-
public information previously provided be returned or destroyed in accordance with the applicable
confidentiality agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may grant a waiver of any standstill provisions in any
agreement with any person to permit such person to make an Alternative Proposal privately and confidentially
to the Board of Directors of the Company. Any breach of this Section 5.3(a) by any Representative of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (acting as such) will be deemed to be a breach by the Company.
(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.3(a) and subject to Section 5.3(c), if the Company
receives an Alternative Proposal prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, that did not result from
a breach, in any material respect, of Section 5.3 (i) the Company and such Representatives may contact the third
party making such Alternative Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or inform such person of the
existence of the provisions in this Section 5.3 or (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, such Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal, the
Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party (including such
third party’s Representatives) making such Alternative Proposal, if, prior to so furnishing such information, the
Company receives from the third party an executed agreement having provisions (including requiring such party
to keep such information confidential) that are not less favorable in any material respect to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that (i) such agreement need not have
comparable standstill provisions and (ii) such agreement shall not contain terms that prohibit the Company from
complying with the provisions of this Section 5.3) (provided that the Company shall substantially concurrently
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter) with the delivery to such person provide to Parent
any nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available
to such person or its Representatives unless such nonpublic information has been previously provided or made
available to Parent or its Representatives), and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party
(including such third party’s Representatives) with respect to the Alternative Proposal.
(c) The Company will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing of the receipt
of any Alternative Proposal and shall in any such written notice to Parent, include copies of any written
materials relating to such Alternative Proposal (including materials provided by the Company in response
thereto) and indicate the identity of the person making such proposal and the material terms and conditions of
such proposal and thereafter shall promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) keep Parent reasonably informed on
a reasonably current basis of any material change to the terms of any such Alternative Proposal, including by
providing a copy of all additional written documentation relating thereto. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.3.
(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(d), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) fail

Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (other than a

(iii) fail to issue a press release publicly reaffirming the Recommendation in response to an Alternative Proposal
that has been publicly disclosed within ten (10) Business Days after a request by Parent to do so (provided, that
the Company shall not be required to reaffirm more than once per Alternative Proposal (unless the terms of such
Alternative Proposal change in any material respects and such change is publicly announced or disclosed)), (iv)
fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (v) fail to publicly reaffirm the Recommendation after
the commencement of any third party tender offer or exchange offer of an Alternative Proposal structured as
such pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such
offer after a request by Parent to do so (provided, that the Company shall not be required to reaffirm more than
once per Alternative Proposal (unless the terms of such Alternative Proposal change in any material respects
and such change is publicly announced or disclosed)), or (vi) approve, endorse or recommend, or resolve to or
publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal or submit any Alternative
Proposal to a vote of the Company Shareholders (any of the foregoing actions in clauses (i) through (v), a
“Change of Recommendation”); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, (y) any determination or action by
the Board of Directors of the Company to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.3(b) or Section 5.3(d) shall
not be, and shall not be deemed to be, in and of itself a breach or violation of this Section 5.3 and shall not,
unless a Change of Recommendation has occurred, give Parent a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(h), and none of the following, in and of itself, shall constitute a Change of Recommendation: (I) the
private determination by the Board of Directors of the Company that an Alternative Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (II) a public press release as to the determination described in prior clause (I) so long as
such press release also states that no Change of Recommendation or termination of this Agreement shall occur
until the expiration of the applicable Match Period contemplated by Section 5.3(e) has occurred and promptly
after the end of such Match Period the Company shall either (x) issue a public press release stating that the prior
Alternative Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) make a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or (III) the delivery by the Company to Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective Representatives of the notice required by Section 5.3(c) or (e)).
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to an Alternative Proposal that did not result from a breach in any material
respect of Section 5.3(a), if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (1) such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (2) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Board of Directors of the Company may: (x) effect a Change of
Recommendation; and/or (y) cause the Company to, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary the Company may, terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(g) and substantially
concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect such Superior Proposal (a “Company Acquisition
Agreement”); provided that prior to taking any such action: (A) the Company provides Parent four (4) Business
Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include the information with
respect to such Superior Proposal that is specified in Section 5.3(c) (it being understood that each time any
material revision or amendment to the terms of the Alternative Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal is
made, including any revision or amendment to the financial terms, written notice to Parent shall be required and
the four (4)-Business Day period shall be extended for an additional two (2) Business Days after notification of
such change in accordance with Section 5.3(c) and this Section 5.3(e) to Parent); (B) during the applicable period
described in clause (A) (the “Takeover Notice Period”), the Company considers and discusses with Parent in
good faith any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent; and (C) at the
end of the Takeover Notice Period, the Board of Directors of the Company again makes the determination in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and after taking into account
any adjustments or modifications proposed by Parent during the Takeover Notice Period), that the Alternative
Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to clause (i), (iii) or (iv) of the definition thereof in response to an
Intervening Event if: (x) the Company provides Parent four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, which notice shall identify and include all material information with respect to such
Intervening Event and a description of the Board of Directors of

the Company’s rationale for such action; (y) during such four (4)-Business Day period described in clause (x)
(together with the Takeover Notice Period, the “Match Period”), the Company considers and discusses in good
faith with Parent any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent; and (z) at
the end of the four (4)-Business Day period described in clause (x), the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel (after taking into
account any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent during the period
described in clause (x)) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(f) As used in this Agreement:
(i) “Alternative Proposal” shall mean any bona fide, written proposal or offer from any third party relating
to (a) a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company as a result of which the stockholders of the
Company immediately prior to such transaction would cease to own at least eighty percent (80%) of the
fully-diluted total voting power of the Company or any surviving entity (or any direct or indirect parent
company thereof) immediately following such transaction, (b) a tender offer or exchange offer or other
transaction which, if consummated, would result in a direct or indirect acquisition by such third party of
more than twenty percent (20%) of the fully-diluted total voting power represented by the outstanding
voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets constitute over twenty percent
(20%) of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (c) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by such third party of over twenty percent
(20%) of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(ii) “Intervening Event” means a material fact, event, occurrence, development, change or change in
circumstances that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of the Company as
of the date hereof (or if known to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of the
Company as of the date hereof) and becomes known to the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the
time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained; provided, however that none of the following will
constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been, an Intervening Event: (i) the receipt,
existence of or terms of an Alternative Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof and
(ii) changes in the market price or trading volume of Company Common Stock or the fact that the Company
meets or exceeds internal or published projections, budgets, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or
other financial results for any period (provided, however, that the underlying causes of such change or fact
shall not be excluded by this clause (ii)).
(iii) “Superior Proposal” shall mean a written Alternative Proposal that was not solicited in breach in any
material respect of Section 5.3(a) made by any third party on terms that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, is more favorable to the Company Stockholders (in their capacities as such) from a financial
point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account the financial,
legal, regulatory, conditionality and other aspects of such proposal and any irrevocable written proposal
by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.3(e) prior to the time of such
determination; provided that solely for purposes of defining a “Superior Proposal” all references in the
definition of “Alternative Proposal” to “twenty percent (20%)” and “eighty percent (80%)” shall be deemed
to be a reference to “fifty percent (50%).”
(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from complying
with applicable Law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, including taking and disclosing to the
Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or under Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act; provided that any such disclosure that constitutes or contains a Change of Recommendation shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(d) (it being understood that a disclosure that constitutes only a “stop,
look and listen” statement or similar communication of the type
A-32
TABLE OF CONTENTS
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation
if it reaffirms the Recommendation). For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes the
Company’s receipt of an Alternative Proposal, that the Board of Directors of the Company is considering the
Alternative Proposal, that no position has been taken by the Board of Directors of the Company as to the
advisability or desirability of such Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto will not be deemed a Change of Recommendation.

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event
no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof), prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement
in preliminary form, which shall, subject to Section 5.3, include the Recommendation, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy
Statement. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company such information as the Company may
reasonably request for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have the preliminary Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Company learns that the preliminary Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff has no
further comments thereon. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required documents
(or in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect thereto, each party shall afford the other party reasonable time to consider the drafts and revised
drafts of such documents and consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other party. The
Company will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request
by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and
will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
prepare and file with the SEC all other documents required by the Exchange Act in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any such other filings.
(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which,
in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, should be set forth in an amendment
of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement and in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the stockholders
of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law.
(c) All documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
The Company shall include in the Proxy Statement (i) the Fairness Opinions, in their entirety, together with
summaries thereof, and (ii) the information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and applicable Law with
respect thereto such that the Proxy Statement constitutes a notice of appraisal rights under Section 262(d)(2) of
the DGCL and applicable Law.
(d) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement and applicable Law, the Company shall take all action
necessary in accordance with the DGCL and the Company Certificate of Incorporation, and the Company By-
Laws, to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but not sooner than twenty (20) Business Days) following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the “Company Meeting”). The
Company will conduct a “broker search” as contemplated by and in accordance
A-33TABLE OF CONTENTS
with Rule 14a-13 promulgated under the Exchange Act and establish a record date for the Company Meeting in a
manner to enable the record date for the Company Meeting to be set so that such Company Meeting will be
duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable following clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Company may postpone or adjourn to a later date the Company Meeting (i)
with the written consent of Parent, (ii) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company’s stockholders as
required by applicable Law in advance of the Company Meeting, (ii) for the absence of a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company
Common Stock to adopt this Agreement, whether or not a quorum is present or (iv) if required by applicable
Law, provided, that in no event shall the Company Meeting be postponed or adjourned beyond the date that is
three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date without the prior written consent of Parent.
(e) The Company shall, unless there has been a Change of Recommendation, use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall (x)
submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Meeting and (y) not submit any Alternative
Proposal for approval by the stockholders of the Company.
(f) The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably
requested by Parent and shall provide such information and reasonable cooperation as Parent may reasonably
request in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall remain obligated to provide the
information and cooperation described in the immediately preceding sentence and duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement
thereto that maybe required by applicable Law) to the Company’s stockholders in accordance with this Section

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall honor all Company Benefit
Plans and Company Foreign Plans in accordance with their terms. For a period of one (1) year following the
Effective Time (or if shorter, until the employee’s termination of employment), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who continues in employment with Parent or one of its Affiliates following the Effective Time (each, a “Company
Employee”), (i) an annual base salary or wage rate at least equal to the annual base salary or wage rate provided
to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target cash incentive bonus
opportunities that are no less favorable than the target cash incentive bonus opportunities provided to such
Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation opportunities and
employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the other compensation opportunities and
employee benefits provided to such Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each
case without regard to any retention, change in control, stay, transaction, or similar non-routine compensation
or compensation opportunities, or equity or equity-based compensation). For a period of one (1) year following
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
Company Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (including the
Company) within such year, severance payments and benefits that are no less favorable than the severance
payments and benefits set forth on Section 5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (assuming a severance-
qualifying termination under the plan and taking into account the service crediting provisions of Section 5.5(b)).
(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting under any tax-qualified retirement plan, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee shall
be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Old Plan in which such Company Employee
A-34TABLE OF CONTENTS
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, to the extent permitted under the terms of the New Plans, (i) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall ensure that each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any New Plans applicable to such Company Employee to the extent that no waiting period would
have applied under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, to the extent that such expenses were
recognized for such purposes under the corresponding Old Plan(s).
(c) If the Effective Time occurs on or before December 31, 2022, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Affiliates to, honor, in accordance with its terms, each of the Company Benefit Plans
providing for annual cash incentive bonus opportunities for 2022 (or portion thereof) that are set forth on
Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a “2022 Bonus Plan”). Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates to, pay to each Company Employee who participates in a 2022
Bonus Plan a bonus in accordance with the terms set forth on Section 5.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and otherwise earned in accordance with the terms and conditions of such 2022 Bonus Plan (including any
condition of continued employment); provided, that any elections made by a Company Employee to receive a
bonus pursuant to any 2022 Bonus Plan in the form of Company Common Stock or an equity or equity-based
award will automatically be deemed void as of the Effective Time, and each such bonus, to the extent earned,
shall be paid in cash to such eligible Company Employee.
(d) Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the
meaning of the Company Stock Plans, the Company Benefit Plans and the Company Foreign Plans, as
applicable, will occur at the Effective Time.

are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement or who are based outside of the United States, Parent’s
obligations under this Section 5.5 shall be in addition to, and not in contravention of, any obligations under the
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement or under the Laws of the foreign countries and political
subdivisions thereof in which such Company Employees are based.

rights or remedies, including any right to continuance of employment or any other service relationship with
Parent or any of its Affiliates, or any right to compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under
this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.5, express or implied, shall be (i) construed to create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any person, (ii) an amendment or deemed amendment of any plan providing benefits to any
employee or (iii) construed to interfere with the right of Parent or its Affiliates to manage the performance of,

documents or in any agreement provided to Parent at least one (1) day prior to the date hereof shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for up to six (6) years from the Effective Time; provided,
however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within
such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. For a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company’s and any Company Subsidiary’s
certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar organization documents in effect as of the date hereof, and
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the

indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time,

contemplated hereby; provided that the premium for such “tail” policy shall not exceed three hundred percent

parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (or the Equity Commitment Letters or Fee
Funding Agreements) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach or threaten to breach such
provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that, subject in all respects to the terms, limitations and
conditions of this Section 8.6 and, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any monetary damages, Section

hereto to institute any Action for (or limit any party’s right to institute any Action for) specific performance

damages before or after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this
Section 8.6 or anything set forth in this Section 8.6 restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of Article 7 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement, the Commitment
Letters or the Fee Funding Agreements that may be available then or thereafter (subject in each case the terms,
limitations and conditions set forth herein and therein); provided that the parties acknowledge and agree that,
