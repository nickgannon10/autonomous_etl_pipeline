(page 31)
On November 14, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “merger
agreement”) with Parent and Merger Sub, providing for, subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by law) waiver of specified conditions, the acquisition of the Company by Parent at a price of $90.50 in cash,
without interest, per share of common stock (the “merger consideration”). Subject to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “merger”),
with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “surviving
corporation”). A copy of the merger agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy statement.
If the merger is consummated, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
time the merger is consummated (the “effective time”) will be converted into the right to receive $90.50 in
cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, other than shares of common stock held by
(i) Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time, which will be automatically canceled, and no
payment will be made with respect therefor and (ii) any subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than
Merger Sub) immediately prior to the effective time, which will be, at the election of Parent, either (a)
converted into shares of common stock of the surviving corporation or (b) canceled, and no payment will be
made with respect therefor (collectively, “excluded shares”).
If the merger is consummated, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the common stock to be
delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time, and,
accordingly, the common stock will no longer be publicly traded.",11,11

The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock
entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter (the “Company stockholder
approval”). Under Maryland law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition
to the consummation of the merger. Approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment

(page 48)
Morgan Stanley was retained by the Company to act as its financial advisor in connection with a review of
the Company’s strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. The Company selected
Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and
reputation and its knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company. As part of this engagement, the
Board requested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.
On November 14, 2021, Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated November 14, 2021, and that is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex B, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of shares of common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated November 14, 2021, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the
review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. CyrusOne stockholders are urged to, and should, read
the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion is directed to the Board and addresses only the
fairness, from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of common stock of the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and does not constitute an opinion or recommendation as to how any CyrusOne stockholder should vote at
the special meeting. The summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

As of the effective time:
each option to purchase shares of common stock (each, a “Company stock option”) outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled in exchange for the merger consideration, less
the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such Company stock option, but any
Company stock option with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration
will be canceled for no consideration;
each award of shares of common stock subject to forfeiture conditions (each, a “Company restricted
share award”) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled in exchange for the
merger consideration, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such Company restricted share
award, with the number of such shares subject to such Company restricted share award determined
assuming the maximum level of achievement of any applicable performance criteria;
each restricted stock unit with respect to shares of common stock (each, a “Company RSU”)
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled in exchange for the merger
consideration, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such Company RSU, plus the amount of
any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents, with the number of shares subject to such Company
RSU determined assuming the maximum level of achievement of any applicable performance criteria;
and
each class of partnership units of the Company Operating Partnership designated as “LTIP units”
(each, an “LTIP unit award” and, collectively with the Company stock options, Company restricted
share awards, and Company RSUs, the “Company equity awards”) outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time will be canceled in exchange for the merger consideration, multiplied by the number
of LTIP units subject to such LTIP unit award, plus the amount of any declared but unpaid
distributions, with the number of LTIP units subject to such LTIP unit award determined assuming the
maximum level of achievement of any applicable performance criteria.
With respect to Company equity awards granted prior to the date of the merger agreement or granted at any
time to non-employee directors, the consideration described above will become vested and payable at the
effective time, subject to any applicable withholding tax. With respect to Company equity awards granted
following the date of the merger agreement (other than those granted to non-employee directors), the
consideration described above will remain subject to any time-vesting criteria that applied to the applicable
Company equity award, including with respect to any accelerated vesting terms upon a qualifying
termination of employment. For company equity awards subject to performance criteria, the maximum level of
performance is 200% or 300% of target performance, as applicable.

The Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and
considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the execution, delivery and performance

below in “The Merger - Treatment of Company Equity Awards”);
severance and other benefits in the case of certain qualifying terminations under the terms of an
individual employment or severance agreement;
cash-based deal retention bonuses under a program established for the benefit of certain Company
employees, including executive officers;
each participant (including each executive officer) in the Company’s annual bonus plan will be eligible
for a pro-rated annual bonus for the year in which the effective time occurs if such participant is
terminated prior to the date such bonuses are earned and he or she otherwise qualifies for severance;
and

provided, that this right to terminate the merger agreement shall not be available to any party if the
failure of such party to perform or comply in any material respect with any of its obligations under the

Termination by the Company
The Company may also terminate the merger agreement and abandon the transactions contemplated thereby

determines that such rights apply. The Board has made no such determination. In addition, because shares

The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions
regarding the special meeting and the merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions
that may be important to you. You should read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this
proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
On November 14, 2021, the Company entered into the merger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company,
with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Parent.
You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board in
favor of the merger proposal and the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting described
below under “- What proposals will be considered at the special meeting?”
As a holder of common stock, what will I receive in the merger?
If the merger is consummated, you will be entitled to receive $90.50 in cash, without interest and less
any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that you own immediately prior to the
effective time.
The receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 65 for a more detailed description of the
United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. You should consult your own tax advisor
for a full understanding of how the merger will affect your federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. taxes.
Will I receive any regular quarterly dividends with respect to the shares of common stock that I own?
On October 27, 2021, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share of common
stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, which will be paid on January 7, 2022 to CyrusOne
stockholders of record at the close of business on January 3, 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, during the pendency of the merger, the Company is permitted to pay regular quarterly
dividends, at a quarterly rate not to exceed $0.52 per share of common stock, to CyrusOne stockholders.
Dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of the Board. The Board may change the Company’s
dividend policy at any time and there can be no assurance as to amount or timing of dividends in the
future.
The Company is also permitted to authorize, declare and pay any special dividends to CyrusOne
stockholders during the term of the merger agreement that, in the reasonable discretion of the Board, on
the advice of legal counsel, are necessary or advisable to maintain our status as a REIT or to avoid the
payment of income or excise tax or to preserve the tax status of any subsidiary (with any such special
dividend resulting in a corresponding decrease to the merger consideration).
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Dividends”
beginning on page 67.
What will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the merger?
As of the effective time:
each Company stock option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled in
exchange for the merger consideration, less the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares
subject to such Company stock option, but any Company stock option with an exercise price that is
equal to or greater than the merger consideration will be canceled for no consideration;
each Company restricted share award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be
canceled in exchange for the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company restricted share award, with the number of such shares subject to such Company restricted
share award determined assuming the maximum level of achievement of any applicable performance
criteria;
each Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled in exchange
for the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such Company RSU, plus
the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents, with the number of shares subject to
such Company RSU determined assuming the maximum level of achievement of any applicable
performance criteria; and
each LTIP unit award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled in exchange
for the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of LTIP units subject to the LTIP unit award,
plus the amount of any declared but unpaid distributions, in each case, with the number of LTIP units
subject to such LTIP unit award determined assuming the maximum level of achievement of any
applicable performance criteria.
With respect to Company equity awards granted prior to the date of the merger agreement or granted at
any time to non-employee directors, the consideration described above will become vested and payable
at the effective time, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. With respect to Company equity
awards granted following the date of the merger agreement (other than those granted to non-employee
directors), the consideration described above will remain subject to any time-vesting criteria that
applied to the applicable Company equity award, including with respect to any accelerated vesting
terms upon a qualifying termination of employment. For company equity awards subject to performance
criteria, the maximum level of performance is 200% or 300% of target performance, as applicable.
See “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Company Equity Awards” beginning on page 72.
What will happen to the Company ESPP?
Following the date of the merger agreement: (i) with respect to any outstanding Purchase Period(s)
under the Company ESPP as of such date, no participant can increase the percentage amount of his or
her payroll deduction election in effect as of such date for such Purchase Period(s) and no new
participants can participate in such Purchase Period(s); (ii) no new Purchase Period will commence
under the Company ESPP on or after such date; (iii) any Purchase Period under the Company ESPP that
does not end prior to the effective time will terminate and a Purchase Date will occur immediately prior to
the effective time with respect to such Purchase Period, in which case any shares of common stock
purchased pursuant to such Purchase Period will be treated the same as all other shares of common
stock in the merger; and (iv) immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of the effective time, the
Company ESPP will terminate.
When and where is the special meeting of our stockholders?
The special meeting of stockholders of the Company will be held on February 1, 2022 at 9:30 a.m.,
Central Time (10:30 a.m., Eastern Time), in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special
meeting, you should visit https://meetnow.global/MTUZUCT. You will be required to enter a control
number, included on your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive,
which will allow you to participate in the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you
are a CyrusOne stockholder as of the record date.
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
Only CyrusOne stockholders of record at the close of business on December 23, 2021, the record date
for the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any
postponement or adjournment thereof. As of the close of business on the record date, there were
129,555,316 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each CyrusOne stockholder is
entitled to one vote per share of common stock held by such CyrusOne stockholder on the record date
on each of the proposals presented in this proxy statement.
If on December 23, 2021, you were a “record” holder of common stock (that is, if you held common stock in
your own name in the stock register maintained by our transfer agent, Computershare Trust

Company, N.A.), you are entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy. Whether or not you
intend to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote now, online,
by phone or by proxy card to ensure that your vote is counted.
If on December 23, 2021, you were the beneficial owner of common stock held in “street name” (that is, if you
held common stock through your broker), then these materials are being forwarded to you by your
broker. You may direct your broker how to vote your common stock by following the voting instructions
on the form provided by your broker. If you hold any common stock through your broker and wish to
attend the virtual special meeting, you may attend the virtual special meeting but may not be able to
vote unless you first obtain a legal proxy issued in your name from your broker or other nominee. The
cut-off time for submitting a legal proxy is January 27, 2022, three business days prior to the date of the
special meeting, at 4:00 p.m., Central Time (5:00 p.m., Eastern Time).
What proposals will be considered at the special meeting?
At the special meeting, CyrusOne stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following
proposals:
a proposal to approve the merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the merger
agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the “merger proposal”);
a proposal to approve, by advisory (non-binding) vote, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the consummation of the merger (the
“advisory compensation proposal”); and
a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal (the
“adjournment proposal”).
What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the special meeting?
The presence in person or by proxy of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes
entitled to be cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting.
Virtual attendance at the special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the
special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be
counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the CyrusOne stockholders entitled to vote at the
special meeting, present virtually or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting. In addition, our bylaws
permit the chair of the special meeting, acting in his or her own discretion and without any action by our
stockholders, to adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the
special meeting. In either case, the adjourned meeting may take place without further notice other than
by an announcement made at the special meeting unless the adjournment is for more than 120 days after
the original record date or if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at the special meeting (subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, including that the
special meeting generally may not be held, without Parent’s consent, on a date that is more than 30 days
after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled). In the event that a quorum is not
present at the special meeting, or if there are insufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the
time of the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be postponed or adjourned to solicit
additional proxies.
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock
entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Under Maryland law and the
merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger.
Note that you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the advisory
compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa. Abstentions or failures to vote

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a CyrusOne stockholder’s behalf) will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special
meeting, abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a CyrusOne
stockholder’s behalf) will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory compensation proposal.
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting,
abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a CyrusOne
stockholder’s behalf) will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal. The Company
does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal is approved at the special meeting.
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
The Board recommends a vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and
“FOR” the adjournment proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the approval of
the merger proposal, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Reasons for
the Merger” beginning on page 41.
How do the Company’s directors and executive officers intend to vote?
As of December 23, 2021, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned in the
aggregate 461,973 shares of common stock, or approximately 0.4% of the outstanding shares of common
stock as of December 23, 2021. Although none of the directors or executive officers is obligated to vote
to approve the merger proposal, we currently expect that each of these individuals will vote all of his or
her shares in favor of each of the proposals to be presented at the special meeting.
Do any of the Company’s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger that are different from,
or in addition to, my interests as a CyrusOne stockholder?
In considering the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting, you should be aware that the
Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, your interests as a CyrusOne stockholder. The members of the Board were aware
of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the merger proposal and
recommend that CyrusOne stockholders approve the merger proposal. These interests may include:
the treatment of Company equity awards provided for under the merger agreement (as described
below in “The Merger - Treatment of Company Equity Awards”);
severance and other benefits in the case of certain qualifying terminations under the terms of an
individual employment or severance agreement;
cash-based deal retention bonuses under a program established for the benefit of certain Company
employees, including executive officers;
each participant (including each executive officer) in the Company’s annual bonus plan will be eligible
for a pro-rated annual bonus for the year in which the effective time occurs if such participant is
terminated prior to the date such bonuses are earned and he or she otherwise qualifies for severance;
and
continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement, the Company’s
organizational documents and indemnification agreements the Company has entered into with each of
its directors and executive officers.
These interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger” beginning on page 59.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens if I transfer my common stock before the special meeting?
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you own
common stock on the record date but transfer your shares after the record date but prior to the special
meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares of common stock at the special meeting.
However, the right to receive the merger consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred
your shares of common stock.
How do I vote if I am a CyrusOne stockholder of record?
If you are a CyrusOne stockholder of record, you may vote in advance by authorizing a proxy for the
special meeting via the internet, by telephone or by completing, signing, dating and mailing the
enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided. In order to submit a vote by proxy via the internet or
telephone, follow the applicable instructions shown on the proxy card mailed to you. You may also vote
by attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live webcast.
For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting - Voting Procedures” beginning on page 26.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we urge you to vote now to ensure your
vote is counted. You may still attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast if you
have already voted by proxy.
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock
entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. If you fail to authorize a proxy
to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee on how to vote, the effect will be that the shares of common stock that you own will not be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, if you
fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your
broker on how to vote, it will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. Abstentions will not be
considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory compensation
proposal or the adjournment proposal.
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?
Yes. For CyrusOne stockholders of record, any time after you have submitted a proxy card and before the
proxy card is exercised, you may revoke or change your vote in one of three ways:
You may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy
or voting instructions) whether made on the internet, by telephone or by mail.
You may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company’s Corporate Secretary at 2850 N.
Harwood St., Suite 2200, Dallas, TX 75201.
You may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the virtual
special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.
Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of
revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of
revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name”, you will need to revoke or resubmit your proxy through your
broker and in accordance with its procedures. If your broker allows you to submit a proxy via the
internet or by telephone, you may be able to change your vote by submitting a new proxy via the
internet or by telephone (or by mail). In order to attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the
webcast, you will need to obtain a proxy from your broker, the CyrusOne stockholder of record.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement
or multiple proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your common stock in more than
one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account
in which you hold common stock. Please submit each proxy and voting instruction card that you receive to
ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.
If I hold my common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
No. Promptly after the effective time, and in any event not later than the fifth business day after the
effective time, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of common stock entitled to the
merger consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions advising such CyrusOne stockholder how
to surrender its common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Each holder of common stock
will be entitled to receive the merger consideration upon the surrender of such certificate for cancelation
to the paying agent together with the associated letter of transmittal, duly completely and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the paying agent. You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy
card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the paying agent without a letter of
transmittal. If you hold common stock in non-certificated book-entry form, you will not be required to
deliver a stock certificate, and you will instead receive your cash payment after the paying agent
receives the documents requested in the applicable instruction.
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder?
No. As permitted by Maryland law, our charter provides that holders of common stock may not exercise
any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value
of their shares in connection with a merger unless the Board, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of
the Board, determines that such rights apply. The Board has made no such determination. In addition,
because shares of our common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of the record
date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting, our stockholders who
object to the merger do not have any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting
stockholder under the Maryland General Corporation Law in connection with the merger.
When is the merger expected to be consummated?
We currently expect to consummate the merger during the second quarter of 2022, subject to receipt of
the Company stockholder approval and the required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver
of the other conditions to the merger described in the merger agreement.
What effect will the merger have on the Company?
If the merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company
will continue to exist following the merger as a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Parent. If the merger
is consummated, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the common stock to be delisted
from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as
reasonably practicable following the effective time, and, accordingly, the common stock will no longer
be publicly traded.
What happens if the merger is not consummated?
In the event that the Company stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated
for any other reason, CyrusOne stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common
stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company,
the common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the
common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the Company’s stockholders
will continue to own their shares of common stock and will continue to be subject to the same general
risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of the common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the
delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more CyrusOne
stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those
CyrusOne stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding”, potentially
means extra convenience for CyrusOne stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Brokers with account holders who are CyrusOne stockholders of the Company may be “householding”
proxy materials. A single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple CyrusOne stockholders sharing an
address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected CyrusOne stockholders. If
you have received notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your
address, such “householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your
consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive
a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker and direct your written request to CyrusOne Inc.,
Attention: Investor Relations Department, 2850 N. Harwood St., Suite 2200, Dallas, TX 75201 or call 972-
350-0060. CyrusOne stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their
address and would like to request “householding” of their communications should contact their broker.

CyrusOne Inc._20211230_DEFM14A_19745922_4359686.Pdf,CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The information included in this proxy statement, together with other statements and information publicly
disseminated by CyrusOne, contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. CyrusOne intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions
for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and includes
this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions.
In particular, statements pertaining to CyrusOne’s capital resources, portfolio performance, financial
condition and results of operations contain certain forward-looking statements. Likewise, all of CyrusOne’s
statements regarding anticipated growth in CyrusOne’s funds from operations and anticipated market
conditions, demographics and results of operations are forward-looking statements. You can identify
forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, “may”,
“will”, “should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “plans”, “estimates” or “anticipates” or the negative
of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases that are predictions of or indicate future events or
trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by
discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and
uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements
depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to
realize them. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or
projected.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from
those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: (i) CyrusOne’s proposed merger with
Parent may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including the risk that any required regulatory
approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely
affect CyrusOne or the expected benefits of the proposed merger or that the approval of CyrusOne’s
stockholders is not obtained; (ii) the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger; (iii)
the ability of Parent to obtain debt financing in connection with the proposed merger; (iv) the possibility that
competing offers or acquisition proposals for CyrusOne will be made; (v) the possibility that any or all of the
various conditions to the consummation of the merger may not be satisfied or waived, including the failure to
receive any required regulatory approvals from any applicable governmental entities (or any conditions,
limitations or restrictions placed on such approvals); (vi) the occurrence of any event, change or other
circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger, including in circumstances which would
require CyrusOne to pay a termination fee or other expenses; (vii) the effect of the announcement or
pendency of the merger on CyrusOne’s ability to retain and hire key personnel, its ability to maintain
relationships with its customers, suppliers and others with whom it does business, or its operating results
and business generally; (viii) risks related to diverting management’s attention from CyrusOne’s ongoing
business operations; (ix) the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the merger may result in
significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; (x) the potential widespread and highly uncertain
impact of public health outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; (xi) loss of
key customers; (xii) indemnification and liability provisions as well as service level commitments in
CyrusOne’s contracts with customers imposing significant costs on CyrusOne in the event of losses; (xiii)
economic downturn, natural disaster or oversupply of data centers in the limited geographic areas that
CyrusOne serves; (xiv) risks related to the development of CyrusOne’s properties, including, without
limitation, obtaining applicable permits, power and connectivity and CyrusOne’s ability to successfully lease
those properties; (xv) weakening in the fundamentals for data center real estate, including but not limited to,
increased competition, falling market rents, decreases in or slowed growth of global data, e-commerce and
demand for outsourcing of data storage and cloud-based applications; (xvi) loss of access to key third-party
service providers and suppliers; (xvii) risks of loss of power or cooling which may interrupt CyrusOne’s
services to its customers; (xviii) inability to identify and complete acquisitions and operate acquired
properties; (xix) CyrusOne’s failure to obtain necessary outside financing on favorable terms, or at all; (xx)
restrictions in the instruments governing CyrusOne’s indebtedness; (xxi) risks related to environmental,
social and governance matters; (xxii) unknown or contingent liabilities related to CyrusOne’s acquisitions;
(xxiii) significant competition in CyrusOne’s industry; (xxiv) recent turnover, or the further loss of, any of
CyrusOne’s key personnel; (xxv) risks associated with real estate assets and the industry; (xxvi) failure to
20 TABLE OF CONTENTS
maintain CyrusOne’s status as a REIT or to comply with the highly technical and complex REIT provisions of
the Code; (xxvii) REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect CyrusOne’s ability to execute its
business plan; (xviii) insufficient cash available for distribution to stockholders; (xxix) future offerings of
debt may adversely affect the market price of CyrusOne’s common stock; (xxx) increases in market interest
rates will increase CyrusOne’s borrowing costs and may drive potential investors to seek higher dividend
yields and reduce demand for CyrusOne’s common stock; (xxxi) market price and volume of stock could be
volatile; (xxxii) risks related to regulatory changes impacting CyrusOne’s customers and demand for
colocation space in particular geographies; (xxxiii) CyrusOne’s international activities, including those
conducted as a result of land acquisitions and with respect to leased land and buildings, are subject to
special risks different from those faced by CyrusOne in the United States; (xxxiv) the continuing uncertainty
about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union following the United
Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union; (xxxv) expanded and widened price increases in certain
selective materials for data center development capital expenditures due to international trade negotiations;
(xxxvi) a failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations; (xxxvii) legislative or other actions
relating to taxes; (xxxviii) any significant security breach or cyber-attack on CyrusOne or its key partners or
customers; (xxxix) the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and the People’s Republic of China;
(xl) increased operating costs and capital expenditures at CyrusOne’s facilities, including those resulting
from higher utilization by CyrusOne’s customers, general market conditions and inflation, exceeding revenue
growth; and (xli) other factors affecting the real estate and technology industries generally.
While forward-looking statements reflect CyrusOne’s good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future
performance. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact CyrusOne’s future results,
performance or transactions, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of CyrusOne’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2020, and CyrusOne’s other filings with the SEC. Given these risks and
uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of
actual results. We disclaim any obligation other than as required by law to publicly update or revise any
forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors or for new information,
data or methods, future events or other changes.

Recommendation of the Board
The Board has reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Board unanimously (i) authorized and
approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the merger agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger

stockholders of the Company on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement,
(iii) directed that the merger be submitted for consideration at the special meeting and (iv) recommended that
the stockholders of the Company approve the merger. Accordingly, the Board recommends a vote “FOR” the

discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the approval of the merger
proposal, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Reasons for the Merger”

24 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
attendance at the special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the special
meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as
shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the CyrusOne stockholders entitled to vote at the special
meeting, present virtually or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting. In addition, our bylaws permit the
chair of the special meeting, acting in his or her own discretion and without any action by our stockholders,
to adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the special meeting. In
either case, the adjourned meeting may take place without further notice other than by an announcement
made at the special meeting unless the adjournment is for more than 120 days after the original record date or
if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case a notice of the
adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting (subject
to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, including that the special meeting generally may not be held,
without Parent’s consent, on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was
originally scheduled). In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, or if there are
insufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of the special meeting, we expect that the
special meeting will be postponed or adjourned to solicit additional proxies.",32,33
CyrusOne Inc._20211230_DEFM14A_19745922_4359686.Pdf,Vote Required,"Vote Required
Approval of the Merger Proposal
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock
entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Under Maryland law and the
merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. Note
that you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the advisory compensation
proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa.
Abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a CyrusOne stockholder’s
behalf) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting,
abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a CyrusOne stockholder’s
behalf) will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory compensation proposal.
The vote on the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the
merger proposal. Because the vote on the advisory compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be
binding on the Company, the Board, Parent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because the Company
is contractually obligated to pay the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the consummation of the merger, if the merger is approved by our
stockholders, such compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,
regardless of the outcome of the vote on the advisory compensation proposal.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on
such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, abstentions or
failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a CyrusOne stockholder’s behalf) will
have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal. The Company does not intend to call a vote on
this proposal if the merger proposal is approved at the special meeting.
The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger
proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the
adjournment proposal and vice versa.

Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting and regardless of the number of shares of
common stock you own, your careful consideration of, and vote on, the merger agreement is important and
we encourage you to vote promptly. To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the special
meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend
the virtual special meeting, using one of the following three methods:
Vote via the Internet. Go to www.envisionreports.com/CONE-SM. Login details are located in the
shaded bar on the proxy card mailed to you.
Vote by Telephone. Call toll free 1-800-652-VOTE (8683) within the USA, U.S. territories and Canada.
Vote by Proxy Card. If you do not wish to vote by the internet or by telephone, please complete, sign,
date and mail the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided.
You may also vote by attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live webcast.
If you hold your shares in “street name”, in other words your common stock is held in the name of your broker,
you should have received a proxy card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from that
organization rather than from the Company. In order to vote, complete and mail the proxy card received from
your broker to ensure that your vote is counted. Alternatively, you may vote by telephone or over the
internet as instructed by your broker. To vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy
from your broker. The cut-off time for submitting a legal proxy is January 27, 2022, three business days prior
to the date of the special meeting, at 4:00 p.m., Central Time (5:00 p.m., Eastern Time). Follow the instructions
from your broker included with these proxy materials or contact your broker to request a proxy form. The
timing described in the instructions from your broker may differ from the timing described above. Without
following those instructions, your common stock held in “street name” will not be voted, which will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.

additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Okapi Partners, which is

card is exercised, you may revoke or change your vote in one of three ways:
You may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy
or voting instructions) whether made on the internet, by telephone or by mail.
You may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company’s Corporate Secretary at 2850 N.
Harwood St., Suite 2200, Dallas, TX 75201.
You may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the virtual
special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.
Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of
revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of
revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the special meeting.

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c)
under the Exchange Act, we are asking holders of common stock to approve, by advisory (non-binding)
vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection
with the consummation of the merger. As required by those rules, the Company is asking holders of common
stock to vote on the approval of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive
officers in connection with the consummation of the merger, as disclosed in the table entitled “Potential
Payments to Named Executive Officers”, including the associated narrative discussion, and the agreements,
arrangements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, are
hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the consummation of the merger is a vote
separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the
merger proposal and vote not to approve such compensation and vice versa. Because the vote is advisory in
nature only, it will not be binding on the Company or the Board; as the Company is contractually obligated
to pay such compensation, such compensation will be paid or become payable, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, if the merger is consummated and regardless of the outcome of the advisory
vote.
The Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the advisory compensation proposal.

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger
agreement. This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among members of the
Board, the Company’s management, the Company’s financial advisors or legal advisors, KKR, GIP or any
other person.
The Board and Company management have, from time to time and in concert with financial and legal
advisors, evaluated a range of financial and strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions,
divestitures, joint ventures, business combinations and other similar transactions, as well as the possibility
of obtaining capital investments from third parties to fund the Company’s significant capital needs. These
evaluations have focused on, among other things, the business environment facing data center operators, as
well as conditions and trends in the industry, including consolidation, and included discussions as to
whether the Company should continue to execute on its strategy as a stand-alone public company, pursue
various transformative acquisitions or pursue a sale of all or a portion of the Company. As a result, since the
Company’s initial public offering in 2013, representatives of the Company and its financial and legal advisors
have from time to time engaged in discussions with representatives of other companies, and their financial
and legal advisors, in, or interested in, the data center industry, as well as financial sponsors, including KKR
and GIP, regarding such opportunities.
In mid-March and early-April 2019, the Company received two unsolicited letters from one of its competitors
that we refer to as “Party A”, which included a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company in an all-stock
transaction at an exchange ratio that implied a value of approximately $64.62 per share of common stock at
the time of the second letter, subject to the completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive
transaction agreements and several other conditions. The Board, together with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
(“Morgan Stanley”), the Company’s financial advisor, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (“Cravath”), the
Company’s legal advisor, carefully evaluated Party A’s proposal and began a formal process to further
explore Party A’s proposal, to solicit proposals from other potential acquirors and to compare each of the
Company’s strategic alternatives with its stand-alone plan.
Between April and mid-August 2019, the Company, with assistance from its financial and legal advisors,
prepared a substantial electronic data room and a management presentation to facilitate potential acquirors’
due diligence, and contacted over 15 potential acquirors. As a result of these discussions, the Company
executed non-disclosure agreements with 11 potential acquirors, including KKR, Party A, a financial sponsor
with a significant infrastructure portfolio that we refer to as “Party B”, a financial sponsor with significant
infrastructure and real estate portfolios that we refer to as “Party C”, a financial sponsor with significant
infrastructure and real estate portfolios that we refer to as “Party D”, a financial sponsor with significant
infrastructure and real estate portfolios that we refer to as “Party E”, a competitor that we refer to as “Party
F” and four others, and the Company facilitated due diligence and engaged in discussions regarding a
potential transaction with each of those 11 parties.
In July and August 2019, the Company received initial non-binding indications of interest to acquire the
Company from (1) KKR, which was at that time joint-bidding with a financial sponsor that we refer to as
“Party G”, (2) Party E and (3) Party A.
31 TABLE OF CONTENTS
In August and September 2019, the Company consented to a request from KKR and Party G to add Party B
and a pension fund that we refer to as “Party H” to its joint-bidding consortium, and the Company
consented to a request from Party E to joint-bid with a digital infrastructure fund that we refer to as “Party I”.
Also in August and September 2019, Bloomberg and several other media sources published a series of
articles speculating about a potential sale of the Company.
On August 28, 2019, at the direction of the Company, Morgan Stanley sent a process letter to each of the
potential acquirors in the process at that time, requesting a final bid by September 30, 2019. On September 10,
2019, Cravath provided to those potential acquirors a draft form of a merger agreement.
Between September 13, 2019 and September 24, 2019, Party C, Party A and the joint-bidding consortium
consisting of Party E and Party I each affirmatively withdrew from the process, in each case, expressing a
view that they were unlikely to be able to submit a bid at a valuation that would be attractive to the Company
and its stockholders. On September 26, 2019, the joint-bidding consortium consisting of KKR, Party G, Party
B and Party H indicated that it did not expect to be able to submit a bid by the deadline and that its bid, if
any, would likely be lower than the then-current trading price of the common stock.
As of the final bid deadline on September 30, 2019, none of the potential bidders submitted a bid letter or any
comments on the draft merger agreement. The Board determined that, while it would remain open to any
potential strategic alternatives that enhance stockholder value, in the absence of any actionable bids
following an extensive process, at that time, it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders
to end the formal process of exploring a potential sale transaction and instead focus on executing its
strategic plan as a stand-alone public company.
The Company regularly engages with its stockholders on a range of topics that are important to the
Company and its stockholders. During the course of 2021, members of Company management and certain
members of the Board had discussions with certain stockholders in which those stockholders encouraged
the Company to explore whether a change-of-control transaction would be in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders.
In April 2021, the Company engaged DH Capital, LLC (“DH Capital”) to serve as financial advisor in
connection with the potential divestiture of certain Company assets, including a potential sale of certain data
centers in certain metropolitan areas.
In May 2021, Bruce W. Duncan, the Company’s then President and Chief Executive Officer, met with a senior
executive of Party I at the request of the Party I senior executive. They primarily discussed industry trends
and their respective businesses. At the end of the meeting, the Party I senior executive asked Mr. Duncan
whether the Company had any unfulfilled capital needs or whether there were any other ways in which Party
I may be able to work with the Company. Mr. Duncan indicated that the Company was focused on executing
its strategic plan and that additional capital was not needed at that time.
On July 29, 2021, the Company separated with Mr. Duncan as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, and he resigned from the Board, and David Ferdman, a director on the Board, was appointed
Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.
On August 11, 2021, Party I submitted an unsolicited, preliminary, non-binding indication of interest letter to
the Board proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock at a price of $80.00 in cash per
share, subject to the completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive transaction documents,
investment committee approval and other conditions. In its letter, Party I requested that the Company enter
into a 30-day exclusivity agreement.
Also on August 11, 2021, Mr. Ferdman met with representatives of Party C to engage in preliminary
discussions with respect to a potential joint venture relating to certain of the parties’ respective digital
infrastructure assets located in Europe and Asia. Mr. Ferdman indicated to representatives of Party C that
the Company was likely not interested in pursuing such a joint venture transaction with Party C at that time,
and Mr. Ferdman inquired if Party C had interest in a more significant strategic transaction.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 11 and 12, 2021, certain directors, together with members of Company management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath, met to discuss the proposal from Party I and the
discussions with Party C.
On August 17, 2021, the Board, together with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley and Cravath, met to consider the proposal from Party I and the possibility of initiating a
process to explore strategic alternatives with other parties. The Board considered the risks to the Company
and its business inherent in a potential sale process, including: distraction in operating the business;
potential market leaks and rumors; potential stock price volatility; potential disruption of existing customer
relationships; potential loss of prospective customer deals in the pipeline; and potential challenges relating
to employee retention. The Board further considered all of the information gathered during, and effects
resulting from, the 2019 process described above. The Board also considered the relatively limited universe
of potential acquirors that would have strategic interest in acquiring the Company and the financial ability to
do so. Following these discussions, the Board determined that a review of the Company’s strategic
alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, was in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, but that it would be necessary to manage discussions with any potential transaction
counterparties in a manner that would minimize the potential negative impacts on the Company if a
transaction did not occur, while also maximizing stockholder value in the event that a transaction did occur.
The Board also concluded that, while Party I’s proposal was not sufficiently compelling to grant Party I
exclusivity at that time, the Company would offer to sign a non-disclosure agreement with Party I to facilitate
a limited period of due diligence to allow Party I an opportunity to further clarify and improve its proposal.
The Board determined to defer any outreach to other new potential bidders until after receiving Party I’s
updated proposal, recognizing that recent discussions with Party C were also ongoing. The Board also
formed a working group of the Board (the “Committee”), composed of Lynn A. Wentworth, Chair of the
Board, Alex Shumate, Lead Independent Director, Mr. Ferdman, Denise Olsen and William E. Sullivan, to meet
regularly with the Company’s management and financial and legal advisors and further facilitate the Board’s
day-to-day oversight of the process.
On August 18, 2021, the Board met, together with members of Company management, to consider various
potential financial advisors, and the Board authorized the Company to engage Morgan Stanley and DH
Capital.
On August 19, 2021, the Company formally engaged Morgan Stanley as financial advisor in connection with
the exploration of strategic alternatives and the potential execution of one or more transactions in
connection with such review, based on Morgan Stanley’s experience in similar transactions, including those
in the data center industry, and familiarity with the Company.
Also on August 19, 2021, representatives of Party B initiated discussions with representatives of Morgan
Stanley and indicated their interest in an acquisition of certain of the Company’s data center assets located
in Europe. During the course of the discussions between representatives of Morgan Stanley and Party B,
Party B did not indicate an interest in pursuing an acquisition of the entire Company.
Also on August 19, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of Morgan Stanley shared a draft
non-disclosure agreement with Party I, and notified Party I that, while the Company was not willing to grant
exclusivity based on Party I’s current proposal, the Company would be willing to facilitate Party I’s due
diligence for a period of 15 days with the expectation that Party I would need to submit an updated proposal
in order to continue discussions beyond that time. Party I indicated that the Company’s proposed process
and timeline were acceptable.
On August 20, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to review the recent discussions with Party I, Party B and Party C
and to review the Company’s strategic plan, including its current five-year financial forecasts (the “Financial
Forecasts”, as described further in the section entitled “- Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 45).
On August 24, 2021, the Company formally amended its engagement letter with DH Capital to include serving
as a financial advisor in connection with the exploration of strategic alternatives and the potential execution
of one or more transactions in connection with such review, based on DH Capital’s knowledge of
33 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Company’s assets and the potential interaction between such review and any potential divestiture of
certain data centers in certain metropolitan areas.
On August 26, 2021, the Company and Party I executed a non-disclosure agreement with a customary
standstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a definitive
acquisition agreement with a third party and other customary provisions. Following the execution of the non-
disclosure agreement, Party I was provided access to an electronic data room (the “data room”) containing
certain information and materials regarding the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, material
contracts, real estate leases and other pertinent due diligence information.
Over the next several weeks, Party I and its advisors conducted a due diligence review of the Company,
including reviewing documents provided by the Company in the data room. As part of this due diligence
review, the Company, Party I and their respective representatives engaged in various discussions regarding
the Company, its business, operations, activities and financial information.
Also on August 26, 2021, the Chief Executive Officer of Party C contacted Mr. Ferdman to plan a dinner for
September 21, 2021 between Mr. Ferdman, the Chief Executive Officer of Party C and representatives of
Morgan Stanley.
Also on August 26, 2021, Mr. Ferdman and Katherine Motlagh, the Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, spoke to representatives of a financial sponsor that we refer to as “Party
J”, which had requested a meeting and expressed interest in one or more potential transactions involving
certain assets of the Company, including a site-level joint venture, or potentially a more significant strategic
transaction. Mr. Ferdman and Ms. Motlagh indicated that Party J should reach out to Morgan Stanley if it
had interest in pursuing a significant strategic transaction.
On August 27, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process.
On August 28, 2021, the Board met in two separate sessions to review the Company’s strategic plan,
including the Financial Forecasts.
On September 1, 2021, at the Company’s direction, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with
representatives of Party C and encouraged Party C to submit a preliminary non-binding indication of interest
based on publicly available information at some point during the week of September 6, 2021; Party C
indicated that it would plan to do so in advance of the dinner between the respective Chief Executive
Officers of the Company and Party C scheduled for September 21, 2021.
On September 3, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process.
On September 10, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process.
On September 15, 2021, Party C indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that they were continuing to
work on a preliminary proposal and that they expected to provide an offer to the Company on or prior to
September 21, 2021.
On September 17, 2021, KKR and Party B notified representatives of Morgan Stanley that they intended to
jointly submit an unsolicited, non-binding proposal to acquire the Company.
On September 18, 2021, KKR and Party B submitted a joint non-binding indication of interest to the Board
proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock at a price of $82.50 in cash per share of
common stock.
On September 19, 2021, Party I indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that it was continuing to work
on an updated proposal and it was having difficulty in increasing the amount of the $80.00 in cash per share
initial offer in its August 11 letter.
Also on September 19, 2021, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to review various potential strategic alternatives, including,
34 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
among others, obtaining additional debt financing, pursuing asset dispositions or acquisitions, pursuing
certain joint venture transactions and selling the entire Company. The Board reviewed the terms of the letter
from KKR and Party B, and representatives of Morgan Stanley provided updates on discussions with Party I
and Party C. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also discussed its preliminary financial analyses on a
potential valuation of the common stock based on the Financial Forecasts. DH Capital also presented on the
effect certain potential substantial customer contracts may have on the future financial performance of the
Company. The Board directed Company management and the Company’s financial and legal advisors to
facilitate further due diligence with KKR and Party B pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement.
On September 20, 2021 and September 21, 2021, KKR and Party B, respectively, executed separate non-
disclosure agreements with customary standstill provisions that would automatically terminate upon the
entry by the Company into a definitive acquisition agreement with a third party and other customary
provisions. Thereafter, KKR and Party B and their respective representatives were granted access to the data
room.
During the week of September 20, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley periodically engaged with
representatives of KKR and Party B, Party I and Party C to receive updates on the status of their respective
due diligence processes. Party I confirmed that it was continuing to review the materials that were posted in
the data room, and that it anticipated it would provide a revised acquisition proposal upon conclusion of its
preliminary due diligence review, but an increase (if any) in the $80.00 in cash per share initial offer in its
August 11 letter was likely to be minimal. Party C indicated that it was continuing to evaluate the merits of a
proposed transaction on the basis of publicly available information. Mr. Ferdman and representatives of
Morgan Stanley canceled the dinner with the Chief Executive Officer of Party C that had been previously
scheduled for September 21, 2021 as Party C continued its evaluation of the Company.
On September 20, 2021, Party J indicated to a representative of Morgan Stanley that it was interested in
certain Company assets for a site-level joint venture or outright purchase, and stated that it was also open to
considering an acquisition of the Company.
On September 24, 2021, Party J and a representative of Morgan Stanley discussed the potential for an
acquisition of the Company, but Party J stated that it needed to evaluate its financial capacity to effect any
significant transaction. Party J did not subsequently reengage with Morgan Stanley or the Company.
Also on September 24, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process.
On September 25, 2021, representatives of Party I contacted Morgan Stanley to inform them that it had
completed its preliminary due diligence and that, while Party I remained interested in acquiring the Company,
it was reducing its proposed purchase price from $80.00 in cash per share of common stock to $77.00 in cash
per share. In response, the Company revoked Party I’s access to the data room.
On September 28, 2021, market speculation regarding the Company’s ongoing review of strategic
alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, and the engagement of Morgan Stanley as financial
advisor in connection with such review, was published in the financial press. As a result, a number of
financial sponsors and potential strategic buyers reached out to Morgan Stanley and the Company over the
course of the week, indicating their potential interest in conducting due diligence or exploring an acquisition
of the Company or certain of its assets.
During the period beginning on September 28, 2021 and ending on October 1, 2021, representatives of 14
potential counterparties with varying levels of financial capabilities, consisting of infrastructure funds,
strategic buyers, REITs and private equity firms, including Party A, reached out to Morgan Stanley to
discuss a potential acquisition of the Company or certain of its assets. The Company and representatives of
Morgan Stanley considered the inbound messages and evaluated the potential counterparties’ respective
financial ability, the type of transaction proposed and other relevant factors. Based on those discussions
and considerations and at the direction of the Company, representatives of Morgan Stanley had numerous
discussions with potential counterparties and encouraged them to submit written proposals indicating their
interest in a transaction, including a proposed purchase price and transaction structure. None of these
potential counterparties ultimately submitted any written proposal to acquire the Company or any of its
35 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
assets. Representatives of Party A verbally confirmed to representatives of Morgan Stanley that they were
not interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of the Company.
On September 28, 2021, the Committee met with representatives of Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath
and discussed whether to have Morgan Stanley contact other potential counterparties to gauge their interest
in exploring a potential transaction with the Company. As part of this discussion, representatives of Morgan
Stanley provided the Committee with its views as to the potential counterparties that would likely have both
the interest and financial capability to acquire the Company. As part of the foregoing, representatives of
Morgan Stanley identified certain infrastructure funds and private equity firms, as well as other third-party
capital providers and potential transaction counterparties that had expressed interest in acquiring the
Company during the 2019 process described above. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Committee
authorized the Company’s management and Morgan Stanley to initiate contact with GIP, Party D, Party F and
Party E regarding a potential transaction.
In the days following the Committee meeting on September 28, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley
reached out to those four additional potential counterparties to solicit their interest in submitting a bid to
acquire the Company. Representatives of Party D and Party F expressed preliminary interest in re-exploring a
potential transaction, but were reluctant to submit an indication of interest letter based only on publicly
available information; accordingly, on October 3, 2021, at the direction of the Company, representatives of
Morgan Stanley provided separate draft non-disclosure agreements to Party D and Party F. Over the course
of the following days, the Company and Party D and their respective representatives negotiated a form of
non-disclosure agreement, but Party D ultimately declined to execute the non-disclosure agreement and did
not submit a written acquisition proposal. Party F ultimately declined to provide comments on, or execute,
the non-disclosure agreement, and did not submit a written acquisition proposal. On September 30, 2021,
representatives of Party E and GIP each separately suggested that they may have interest in exploring a
potential transaction.
On September 30, 2021, members of Company management and representatives of KKR and Party B
participated in an in-person management presentation, during which the parties and their representatives
engaged in various discussions regarding the Company, its business, operations, activities and financial
information.
On October 1, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process.
On October 5, 2021, Party C submitted a preliminary non-binding indication of interest to the Board,
proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock at a price of $82.00 in cash per share. In
its letter, Party C requested that the Company negotiate with it on an exclusive basis.
Also on October 5, 2021, KKR and Party B jointly submitted a second non-binding indication of interest to
the Board, reaffirming the terms and conditions of their proposal dated September 18, 2021, including
reaffirming their proposed acquisition price of $82.50 in cash per share of common stock.
Later that day on October 5, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath. Representatives from Morgan Stanley
summarized the proposal received from Party C and the joint proposal received from KKR and Party B. After
a discussion regarding the process and potential alternatives, the Board instructed Company management
and the Company’s advisors to continue discussions with KKR and Party B and Party C, including
facilitating further due diligence and providing a draft merger agreement (subject, in the case of Party C, to
the execution of a non-disclosure agreement).
On October 6, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided to Party C a draft non-disclosure
agreement. Party C noted that in order for Party C to continue its due diligence review of the Company and
undertake negotiations with respect to definitive transaction documentation, it would require full expense
reimbursement by the Company in the event that the Company and Party C did not execute definitive
transaction documentation.
On October 7, 2021, the Company’s draft merger agreement was made available by Cravath to KKR and Party
B.
36 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On October 8, 2021, Party C executed a non-disclosure agreement, which contained a customary standstill
provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a definitive acquisition
agreement with a third party and other customary provisions, but did not include any expense reimbursement
requested by Party C. Later that day on October 8, 2021, Party C was granted access to the data room, and
also received the Company’s draft merger agreement.
Throughout the remainder of October 2021, the Company’s management team uploaded to the data room
additional confirmatory due diligence information regarding the Company and responded, including through
its advisors and via telephonic diligence sessions, to due diligence requests by each of KKR and Party B
and Party C and their respective advisors. Throughout this time, the Committee received frequent updates
from, and had frequent discussions with, the Company’s management team, and representatives of Morgan
Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath, and kept the other directors not on the Committee apprised of material
developments in the process.
On October 14, 2021, members of Company management team and representatives of Party C participated in
an in-person management presentation, during which the parties and their representatives engaged in
various discussions regarding the Company, its business, operations, activities and financial information.
On October 15, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), legal counsel to KKR and Party B, sent a revised
draft of the merger agreement to Cravath. This version of the merger agreement included a “no-shop”
provision restricting the Company from soliciting alternative transactions between execution of the merger
agreement and closing of the merger; it proposed a “Company termination fee” equal to 3.5% of the equity
value of the Company, payable by the Company in the event the merger agreement were terminated under
certain circumstances relating to a change in the Board’s recommendation or a superior proposal; it also
proposed a “reverse termination fee” equal to 3.5% of the equity value of the Company, payable by the
acquiror under certain circumstances relating to a failure by the acquiror to close the transaction.
On October 16, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process.
On October 21, 2021, Party E submitted to the Board a non-binding indication of interest proposing to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock for a price between $82.00 and $85.00 in cash per
share of common stock. Party E indicated that it would need an additional four to six weeks to conduct due
diligence and negotiate definitive transaction documentation. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and
Cravath discussed Party E’s letter with the Committee and members of Company management. The
Committee instructed the Company’s management and advisors to provide Party E with a draft non-
disclosure agreement and facilitate further due diligence and discussions with Party E.
Later that day on October 21, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided to Party E a draft non-
disclosure agreement, which contained a customary standstill provision that would automatically terminate
upon the entry by the Company into a definitive acquisition agreement with a third party and other
customary provisions.
Also on October 21, 2021, Cravath sent a revised draft of the merger agreement on behalf of the Company to
Kirkland. This version of the merger agreement contained a “no-shop” provision, a Company termination fee
equal to 2.5% of the equity value of the Company and a reverse termination fee equal to 7.5% of the equity
value of the Company.
On October 23, 2021, representatives of Party B indicated to Morgan Stanley that Party B would no longer be
able to support the previously proposed purchase price of $82.50 in cash per share of common stock, that
Party B was withdrawing from the bidding process and that the joint proposals from KKR and Party B dated
September 18, 2021 and October 5, 2021 were retracted.
Also on October 23, 2021, representatives of Party C submitted to the Board a revised non-binding indication
of interest affirming Party C’s interest in consummating an acquisition of the Company, and indicating that
Party C would be in a position to complete due diligence and negotiation of a definitive acquisition
agreement by early November. The letter indicated an increase in Party C’s proposed acquisition price to
$85.00 in cash per share of common stock, and was accompanied by a revised draft merger

agreement and letters from financing sources indicating that they were highly confident they would be able
to provide customary financing commitments in connection with the execution of a definitive merger
agreement. The revised merger agreement proposed a “go-shop” provision that would permit the Company
to solicit alternative proposals for a period of 30 days after execution of the merger agreement; it contained a
bifurcated Company termination fee of 1.0% of the equity value of the Company in the event of a termination
to enter into a superior proposal received during the go-shop period and 3.5% of the equity value of the
Company in all other circumstances; and it contained a reverse termination fee equal to 7.0% of the
Company’s equity value. Representatives of Party C also reiterated its requests for exclusivity and for
expense reimbursement by the Company in the event that the Company and Party C were unable to execute
definitive transaction documentation.
On October 24, 2021, representatives of Party C provided Morgan Stanley a proposed framework for its
expense reimbursement, and indicated that such framework, in lieu of a commitment by the Company to
negotiate exclusively with Party C, would be necessary for Party C to continue pursuing a potential
acquisition of the Company.
Later on October 24, 2021, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath and discussed Party C’s October 23, 2021 bid package, including its
requests for exclusivity and/or expense reimbursement. The Board also discussed the parameters of an
expense reimbursement agreement for Party C that would be acceptable, and directed the Company’s
management and financial and legal advisors to begin negotiations on such an expense reimbursement
agreement.
On October 25, 2021, representatives of KKR held a call with representatives of Morgan Stanley, during
which KKR requested the Company’s consent to partner with GIP as a co-bidder.
Also on October 25, 2021, representatives of Cravath provided GIP with a draft non-disclosure agreement,
containing a customary standstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the
Company into a definitive acquisition agreement with a third party and other customary provisions, which
was executed on October 26, 2021, after which time GIP was granted access to the data room.
On October 27, 2021, KKR submitted a non-binding indication of interest letter confirming its continued
interest in consummating an acquisition of the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the indication of interest letter dated October 5, 2021 from KKR and Party B, including a purchase price of
at least $82.50 in cash per share of common stock.
Also on October 27, 2021, Cravath sent a revised draft of the merger agreement on behalf of the Company to
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), outside legal counsel to Party C. This version of
the merger agreement contained a “go-shop” provision, a Company termination fee equal to 1.0% of the
equity value of the Company during the go-shop period and 2.5% of the equity value of the Company
thereafter and a reverse termination fee equal to 8.5% of the equity value of the Company.
On October 29, 2021, Party C shared a proposed draft expense reimbursement agreement with representatives
of Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Morgan Stanley indicated that the Company and its advisors would
review the draft expense reimbursement agreement.
Also on October 29, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath and discussed KKR’s request to partner with GIP, in light of Party
B’s withdrawal from the process. Following these discussions, the Board directed representatives of Morgan
Stanley to permit KKR and GIP to partner with each other as joint-bidders (the “KKR/GIP Consortium”),
subject to GIP’s entry into a non-disclosure agreement.
On October 30, 2021, the Company and Party E executed a non-disclosure agreement with a customary
standstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a definitive
acquisition agreement with a third party and other customary provisions. Following the execution of the non-
disclosure agreement, Party E was provided access to the data room.
Throughout the first week of November 2021, the Company, with the assistance of its financial and legal
advisors, continued discussions with and made significant progress in discussing the proposed terms of
38 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the merger agreement and other transaction documents and addressing due diligence requests from each of
the KKR/GIP Consortium and Party C in parallel. Throughout this time, members of the Committee received
frequent updates from, and had frequent discussions with, the Company’s management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath, and separately kept the other directors not on the Committee
apprised of material developments in the process.
On November 2, 2021, members of Company management held two separate in-person management
presentations: one meeting with representatives of GIP and one meeting with representatives of Party E.
During their respective meetings, the Company and each of GIP and Party E and their respective
representatives engaged in various discussions regarding the Company, its business, operations, activities
and financial information.
On November 5, 2021, representatives of the Company distributed a revised draft expense reimbursement
agreement to Party C.
Also on November 5, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath. During the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided
an overview of recent interactions with the KKR/GIP Consortium, Party C and Party E, noting that the
KKR/GIP Consortium and Party C each appeared to be expending significantly more time and resources in
pursuit of a potential acquisition of the Company than Party E. Following discussion with members of
Company management and financial and legal advisors, the Committee directed the Company’s advisors to
notify each of the KKR/GIP Consortium and Party C that the Company expected final proposals and near-
final transaction documentation by November 12, 2021, with a potential announcement of a transaction by
the morning of November 15, 2021. The Committee also directed the Company’s advisors to request a revised
bid from Party E by November 12, 2021. Following the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley notified
representatives of each of the KKR/GIP Consortium and Party C of the Company’s proposed transaction
timeline and representatives of Morgan Stanley also requested that Party E submit a revised bid on the same
timeline.
On November 9, 2021, Skadden sent a revised draft of a transaction agreement on behalf of Party C to
Cravath, which included certain substantial changes to the initially contemplated transaction structure,
including introducing certain required pre-closing restructurings and asset sales with a special dividend that
would reduce the back-end merger consideration. This transaction agreement contained a “no-shop”
provision in lieu of a “go-shop” provision, a Company termination fee equal to 3.5% of the equity value of
the Company and a reverse termination fee equal to 7.0% of the equity value of the Company. During the
course of the next several days, Cravath and Morgan Stanley discussed with Skadden and representatives of
Party C, respectively, various aspects of the proposed transaction structure and other provisions of the draft
agreement.
On November 10, 2021, Kirkland sent a revised draft of the merger agreement on behalf of the KKR/​GIP
Consortium to Cravath. This version of the merger agreement contained a “no-shop” provision, a Company
termination fee equal to 3.5% of the equity value of the Company and a reverse termination fee equal to 3.5%
of the equity value of the Company.
On November 11, 2021, the Board met with members of Company management and representatives of Morgan
Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process.
Also on November 11, 2021, Skadden sent a revised draft of the merger agreement on behalf of Party C to
Cravath. This version substantially reversed the transaction structure changes that Party C introduced on
November 9, 2021, and it contained a “no-shop” provision, a Company termination fee equal to 3.25% of the
equity value of the Company and a reverse termination fee equal to 7.0% of the equity value of the Company.
Over the course of the following days, the Company, with the assistance of Cravath, and Party C, with the
assistance of Skadden, negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related documentation.
Also on November 11, 2021, Party C sent a revised draft of the expense reimbursement agreement to
representatives of Morgan Stanley, and indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that Party C’s
proposed purchase price was currently still $85.00 in cash per share of common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the morning of November 12, 2021, the Board met with members of Company management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process. Following discussion,
the Board affirmed the proposed transaction timeline and directed Company management and the Company’s
advisors to continue negotiations with a view towards receiving and evaluating final proposals no later than
November 14, 2021.
Later that day on November 12, 2021, the KKR/GIP Consortium submitted a non-binding proposal to the
Board proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company at a price of
$84.00 in cash per share of common stock. Over the course of the following days, the Company, with the
assistance of Cravath, and the KKR/GIP Consortium, with the assistance of Kirkland, negotiated the terms of
the merger agreement and related documentation.
Also on November 12, 2021, representatives of Party E submitted to Morgan Stanley a revised non-binding
indication of interest stating Party E’s interest in pursuing an acquisition of the Company, and indicating
that Party E would be in a position to complete due diligence and negotiation of a definitive acquisition
agreement over the course of the following four weeks. The revised indication of interest included a
proposed acquisition price of $85.00 in cash per share of common stock, and was accompanied by letters
from financing sources indicating that they were highly confident they would be able to provide customary
financing commitments in connection with the execution of a definitive merger agreement.
Also on November 12, 2021, various media sources reported market speculation regarding an imminent
agreement to sell the Company within days, including reported speculation regarding the status of
negotiations between the Company and certain specific potential transaction counterparties.
On November 13, 2021, the Committee met with members of Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, DH Capital and Cravath to discuss the process.
Also on November 13, 2021, the Company and Party C executed an expense reimbursement agreement that
provided that the Company would reimburse Party C for a portion of its out-of-pocket expenses, capped at a
maximum of $7.5 million payable by the Company, incurred in pursuing an acquisition of the Company in the
event that, on or prior to November 14, 2021, Party C delivered to the Company a proposed definitive version
of a merger agreement containing a purchase price of at least $85.00 in cash per share of common stock and
other specified terms, along with debt and equity commitment letters in an aggregate amount sufficient to
consummate the acquisition and a customary limited guarantee, and within a specified time period the
Company entered into a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of the Company with an
alternative bidder instead of Party C.
During the course of November 13 and 14, 2021, financial and legal advisors of the Company continued
discussions in order to finalize the merger agreement and other transaction documents with financial and
legal advisors of each of the KKR/GIP Consortium and Party C, in parallel.
Early in the morning of November 14, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley separately notified each of the
KKR/GIP Consortium and Party C that the Company expected to receive best and final purchase price
proposals that day.
In the afternoon of November 14, 2021, each of the KKR/GIP Consortium and Party C submitted written best
and final proposals to acquire the Company. The KKR/GIP Consortium proposal contained a purchase price
of $90.50 in cash per share of common stock. Party C’s proposal contained a purchase price of $86.00 in cash
per share of common stock.
In the evening of November 14, 2021, the Board met with members of Company management and
representatives of each of Morgan Stanley, DH Capital, Cravath and Venable LLP, the Company’s legal
advisor on matters of Maryland law (“Venable”). Members of Company management and DH Capital
presented to the Board updates on the status of certain commercial transactions. Representatives of Cravath
and Venable delivered remarks regarding the Board’s statutory duties and other relevant legal considerations
for a Maryland corporation in the context of a review of a potential sale transaction. Representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed for the Board the terms of the most recent proposals from the KKR/GIP
Consortium, Party C and Party E. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed with the Board its
financial analyses of the proposed merger consideration and rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which
40

was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated November 14, 2021, and that is attached
to this proxy statement as Annex B, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement with the KKR/GIP Consortium was fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of shares of common stock. Representatives of Cravath delivered a
legal presentation outlining the terms of the near-final draft of the merger agreement with the KKR/GIP
Consortium and the near-final draft of the merger agreement with Party C, and the near-final committed debt
and equity financing documentation with each of the KKR/GIP Consortium and Party C, and discussed the
draft resolutions under consideration by the Board.
After discussion and consideration of a variety of factors, including those described in “- Reasons for the
Merger” beginning on page 41, the Board determined to proceed with the proposal from the KKR/GIP
Consortium and unanimously (i) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, (ii) declared that the merger is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and
stockholders of the Company on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement,
(iii) directed that the merger be submitted for consideration at the special meeting and (iv) recommended that
the stockholders of the Company approve the merger.
Following the meeting of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley notified representatives of the
KKR/GIP Consortium that the Board had adopted resolutions approving the form of merger agreement, and
notified representatives of Party C and Party E that the Company would not be proceeding with a transaction
with either of them.
Shortly thereafter, the Company and the KKR/GIP Consortium finalized and executed the merger agreement
and the other ancillary documentation related to the merger.
The following morning, on November 15, 2021, the Company, KKR and GIP issued a joint press release
announcing the execution of the merger agreement and the proposed terms of the merger.",39,49

the Company on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement;

unanimous determination to authorize and approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, declare the merger advisable and in the best interests of
the Company and stockholders of the Company and recommend that the Company’s stockholders approve
the merger, the Board consulted with and received the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, discussed certain issues with the Company’s management and considered a variety of factors
weighing positively in favor of the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,

the $90.50 per share price of common stock to be paid in cash, which was in excess of the all-time
highest closing price for shares of common stock on any day since the date of the Company’s initial
public offering in January 2013, and which represented a premium of approximately:
25% over the unaffected closing stock price on September 27, 2021, the last full trading day prior to
published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company; and
6% over the closing stock price on November 12, 2021, the last trading day prior to the date when the
merger agreement was executed;
the Board’s understanding of the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings,
prospects, competitive position and the nature of the industry in which the Company competes;
the Board’s understanding of the risks and uncertainties in the industry in which the Company
competes, and the risks that the Company would face if it continued to operate on a stand-alone
public company basis, including:
risks relating to the fundamentals for data center real estate and the real estate industry, including,
but not limited to, increased competition, falling market rents and decreases in or slowed growth of
global data, e-commerce and demand for outsourcing of data storage and cloud-based applications;
risks relating to the operation of the Company, including, but not limited to, economic downturn,
natural disaster or oversupply of data centers in the geographic areas that the Company serves,
significant competition in the data center industry, a loss of key customers, a loss of access to key
third-party service providers and suppliers, a loss of power or cooling which may interrupt the
Company’s services to its customers, increased operating costs and capital expenditures at the
Company’s facilities, including those resulting from higher utilization by customers, unknown or
contingent liabilities related to the Company’s historical acquisitions of property or other assets and
the inability to identify or complete acquisitions of additional properties or other assets;
risks relating to financing of the Company, particularly in light of its capital expenditure requirements,
including, but not limited to, the failure to obtain necessary outside financing on favorable terms, or
at all, restrictions in the instruments governing the Company’s indebtedness, increases in market
interest rates, volatility in the market price and volume of common stock and potential negative
impacts resulting from incurring excessive leverage;
risks relating to the Company’s development of properties, obtaining applicable permits, power and
connectivity and the Company’s ability to successfully lease those properties;
risks relating to compliance with existing and future applicable laws and regulations;
risks relating to the Company’s qualification as a REIT (including distributional requirements and
compliance with technical requirements of the Code); and
other risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on

March 31, 2021, June 20, 2021 and September 30, 2021;
the Company’s recent turnover of executives and other key personnel;
the Board’s determination that other alternatives to a sale of the entire Company, including entering
into financing transactions, divesting certain assets and pursuing joint ventures or acquisitions,
which alternatives the Board evaluated with the assistance of the Company’s advisors, did not
represent an attractive alternative to a sale of the entire Company in light of, among other factors, the
potential risks, rewards and uncertainties associated with those alternatives;
the fact that the consideration to be paid by KKR and GIP is all cash, which provides certainty,
immediate value and liquidity to holders of common stock, especially when viewed against any
internal or external risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s stand-alone strategy,
immediately upon the closing of the merger;
the ability of the Board to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends to the
Company’s stockholders for the entire period between signing and closing of the merger at a

rate of $0.52 per share of common stock in accordance with the merger agreement without a reduction
in the merger consideration to be paid by KKR and GIP to the Company’s stockholders, as more fully
described below in the section entitled “- Dividends”;
the possibility that an infrastructure fund or other private financial sponsor might be able to realize
more value from the business than a public company buyer and thereby pay a higher price to acquire
the Company, including the ability to absorb near-term dilution from capital expenditures in favor of
longer-term growth and to fund developments without having to rely on the volatility of equity
capital markets;
the Company management’s presentation to the Board of its views and analyses, conducted with the
assistance of the Company’s financial advisors, regarding the financial and strategic effects of
signing certain substantial customer contracts in the fourth quarter of 2021, including its views
regarding the Company’s opportunities and constraints affecting future capacity and that such
contracts generally represented a pull-forward of capacity that was previously expected to be realized
in 2022 or 2023, rather than an increase of aggregate expected capacity reflected in the Financial
Forecasts;
the fact that certain stockholders of the Company had encouraged the Company to consider whether
a change-of-control transaction would be in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders
of the Company, as described above in the section entitled “- Background of the Merger”;
the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Board by representatives of Morgan Stanley
and DH Capital as well as the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated November 14, 2021, and that is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of shares of common stock, which is more fully described below
in the section entitled “- Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”;
the Board’s assessment, taking into account the foregoing factors, of the Company’s value on a
stand-alone basis relative to the $90.50 per share of common stock to be paid in cash in connection
with the merger, and the possibility that the trading price of shares of common stock would not reach
and sustain such price, or that doing so could take a considerable period of time;
the Board’s process for soliciting and responding to offers from the third parties that were believed to
be the most willing and able to pay the highest price for the Company, which included providing such
parties with an opportunity to conduct due diligence and conduct management sessions with
members of the Company’s management, as described above in the section entitled “- Background of
the Merger”;
the course and history of competitive arm’s-length negotiations with numerous third parties which,
among other things, resulted in an increase in the merger consideration to $90.50 per share of common
stock from an initial bid of $80.00 per share from Party I on August 11, 2021 and an initial bid of $82.50
per share from the initial KKR consortium on September 18, 2021, as described above in the section
entitled “- Background of the Merger”;
the Board’s belief that, based on discussions with the KKR/GIP Consortium and other potential
counterparties, the final proposal submitted by the KKR/GIP Consortium represented the best and
final offer and the highest price per share of common stock that the KKR/GIP Consortium or any other
potential counterparty would be willing to pay, and any request for a further price increase or
solicitation of additional bids from other third parties would have created a meaningful risk that the
KKR/GIP Consortium might determine not to enter into the transaction and to terminate negotiations,
in which event stockholders of the Company would lose the opportunity to obtain the proposed
$90.50 per share of common stock in cash being offered;
the successful track record that KKR and GIP have developed in acquiring other companies and the
consolidated financial strength and industry expertise of the KKR/GIP Consortium;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the fact that the merger is not subject to a financing condition, that the KKR/GIP Consortium
obtained committed debt financing for the merger from reputable financing sources, and that each of
the KKR Funds and the GIP Funds have committed to make available and provide to Parent, pursuant
to the equity commitment letters, the full amount in cash necessary, along with the committed debt
financing, to fund the aggregate merger consideration;
the fact that the KKR Funds and GIP Funds have provided certain guarantees in favor of the
Company as described below in the section entitled “- Financing of the Merger”;
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company, in response to certain unsolicited
takeover proposals, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties under
certain circumstances and, under certain conditions, to accept a superior proposal, and the
Company’s corresponding right to terminate the merger agreement (subject to the payment to Parent
of the Company termination fee of $319.5 million) in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for the consummation of such superior proposal;
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Board to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify
its recommendation that our stockholders vote to approve the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement under certain circumstances, subject to payment to Parent of
the Company termination fee of $319.5 million if Parent elects to terminate the merger agreement in
such circumstances;
the high probability that the merger would be consummated based on, among other things, KKR’s
and GIP’s independent respective abilities to complete large acquisition transactions, their extensive
respective experience in the real estate industry, the absence of a financing contingency and the
$813.5 million Parent termination fee, payable to the Company if the merger agreement is terminated in
certain circumstances, which payment is guaranteed by the KKR Funds and the GIP Funds, pursuant
to the guarantees delivered by them;
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which were reviewed by the Board with the
Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and the fact that such terms were the
product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties;
the fact that resolutions approving the merger were unanimously approved by the Board, which is
comprised of a majority of independent directors who are not affiliated with the Company and are not
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and
the fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and our stockholders
would be free to reject the merger by voting against the merger.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing
factors related to the merger agreement and the merger, including the following material factors:
the potential upside in the Company’s stand-alone strategic plan;
the financial and strategic effect of certain substantial customer contract bookings executed in the
fourth quarter of 2021, including related analyses presented to the Board by the Company’s
management and financial advisors;
the possibility that the merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all due to a failure
of certain conditions, including with respect to the required approval of the transaction by the
required regulatory authorities;
the risks and costs to the Company if the merger does not close in a timely manner or at all, including
the potential negative impact on the Company’s ability to retain key employees, the diversion of
management and employee attention and the potential disruptive effect on the Company’s day-to-day
operations and the Company’s relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties;
the fact that holders of common stock will have no ongoing equity interest in the surviving
corporation following the merger, meaning that the holders of common stock will not (by virtue of
their holding common stock) participate in the Company’s potential future earnings or growth;

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the consummation of the merger,
which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or
any other action that it might otherwise take with respect to the operations and strategy of the
Company;
the risk that the parties may incur significant costs and material delays resulting from seeking
regulatory approvals and other clearances, consents and approvals necessary for consummation of
the merger;
the provisions of the merger agreement that restrict the Company’s ability to solicit or participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding alternative business combination transactions, subject to
specified exceptions, and that require the Company to negotiate with Parent (if Parent desires to
negotiate) prior to the Company being able to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior
proposal;
the possibility that the Company’s obligation to pay the Company termination fee of $319.5 million to
Parent upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage
other potential acquirors from making an alternative proposal to acquire the Company;
the significant costs involved in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and
consummating the merger, and the fact that if the merger is not consummated, the Company may be
required to bear such costs;
the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the merger agreement and the consummation
of the merger and the other transactions contemplated therein;
the fact that, under Maryland law, the Company’s stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights,
dissenters’ rights or similar rights in connection with the merger; and
the fact that an all-cash transaction would be taxable to the holders of common stock that are U.S.
holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In addition, the Board was aware of and considered the fact that the Company’s executive officers have
financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company’s
stockholders generally, including those interests that are a result of employment and compensation
arrangements with the Company, as described more fully below in the section entitled “- Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather
includes the material factors considered by the Board. The Board unanimously reached the conclusion to
authorize and approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, declare the merger advisable and in the best interests of the Company and stockholders of
the Company and recommend that the Company’s stockholders approve the merger in light of the factors
described above and other factors that the Board believed were appropriate. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered by the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these
matters, the Board did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make
any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was
favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board. Rather, the Board made its
recommendation based on the totality of the information available to the Board, including discussions with,
and questioning of, the Company’s management and its financial and legal advisors. In considering the
factors discussed above, individual members of the Board may have given different weights to different

Other than annual guidance - including the guidance included in the Company’s press release dated
February 17, 2021 and the updates of such guidance in the Company’s press releases dated April 28, 2021,
45 TABLE OF CONTENTS
July 28, 2021 and October 28, 2021 (the “2021 earnings guidance”), with respect to total revenues, capital
expenditures and certain other performance measures, which guidance the Company presents as a range - the
Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts as to future performance, earnings or
other results due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the
Company has included in this proxy statement certain financial forecasts of the Company that, to the extent
described herein, were furnished to the Board, the Company’s financial advisors, KKR, GIP and certain other
parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company, in connection with the discussions
concerning the proposed merger.
These Financial Forecasts (as defined below) were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with
a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the SEC
regarding forward-looking statements or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“GAAP”). A summary of this information is presented below.
While the Financial Forecasts were prepared in good faith, no assurances can be made regarding future
events and the estimates and assumptions underlying these financial forecasts involve judgments with
respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and
future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business,
economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the
inherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industries in which the Company
operates, and the risk and uncertainties described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements” beginning on page 20, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are
outside the control of the Company and, upon consummation of the merger, will be beyond the control of
KKR or GIP and the surviving corporation. The Company’s stockholders are urged to review the Company’s
SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to the Company’s business. There can be no
assurance that the underlying assumptions will prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be
realized. Actual results likely will differ, and may differ materially, from those reflected in the Financial
Forecasts, whether or not the merger is consummated. The inclusion in this proxy statement of the Financial
Forecasts below should not be regarded as an indication that the Company, KKR and GIP, their respective
boards of directors or their respective financial advisors considered, or now consider, these forecasts to be a
reliable predictor of future results. The Financial Forecasts are not fact, and neither they nor any underlying
assumptions should be relied upon as being indicative of future results. Readers of this proxy statement are
cautioned not to place reliance on this information. The Financial Forecasts assume that the Company would
continue to operate as a standalone company and do not reflect any impact of the merger.
The Financial Forecasts include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Net Operating Income,
Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized FFO (in each case, as defined below). The Company’s management
included forecasts of Net Operating Income in the Financial Forecasts because it is a financial measure
commonly used in the REIT industry, as a supplemental performance measure; when compared period over
period, it captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating expenses. The Company’s
management also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, Net Operating
Income is used by investors as a basis to evaluate REITs. The Company’s management included forecasts of
Adjusted EBITDA in the Financial Forecasts because the Company’s management believes that Adjusted
EBITDA can be used by investors as a basis to compare the Company’s operating performance with that of
other companies. The Company’s management included forecasts of Normalized FFO in the Financial
Forecasts because the Company’s management believes that it is a financial measure commonly used in the
REIT industry, as a supplemental performance measure; when compared period over period, this measure
captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating expenses. The Company’s management also
believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, Normalized FFO is used by
investors as a basis to evaluate REITs.
Investors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement are
not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and do not reflect all of the
amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.
Investors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement have
no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors.
46 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Because of the non-standardized definitions, the non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently
from, and will not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by the Company’s competitors
and other REITs, or any similarly titled measures used by KKR or GIP.
Due to the inherent limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider non-GAAP
measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial
performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The footnotes to the tables below provide certain
supplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures. All of the
financial forecasts summarized in this section were prepared by the Company’s management. Neither Deloitte
& Touche LLP (“Deloitte”), the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other
independent registered public accounting firm nor any other person has examined, compiled or otherwise
performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained in these financial
forecasts and, accordingly, neither Deloitte nor any other independent registered public accounting firm has
expressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance with respect thereto and no independent
registered public accounting firm assumes any responsibility for the prospective financial information. The
Deloitte reports incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relate to the historical financial information
of the Company. Those reports do not extend to the Financial Forecasts and should not be read to do so.
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts were relied upon by Morgan Stanley
for its financial analysis in connection with the preparation of its opinion and by the Board for its
consideration of the merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor in connection with a
business combination transaction are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial
measures, and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to, nor relied upon by,
Morgan Stanley or by the Board. In addition, none of KKR, GIP or the other potentially interested parties
that received the Financial Forecasts were provided with any such reconciliation. Accordingly, we have not
provided a reconciliation of the financial measures in this proxy statement.
By including in this proxy statement the Financial Forecasts below, none of the Company, KKR, GIP or any
of their respective representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the
ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the Financial Forecasts.
Accordingly, the Financial Forecasts should not be construed as financial guidance, nor relied upon as such,
and the Financial Forecasts may differ in important respects from the 2021 earnings guidance, which are
presented as a range and which the Company’s management prepared based on a different set of
assumptions. The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement does not constitute an
admission or representation by the Company that the information contained therein is material. The Financial
Forecasts summarized in this section reflected the opinions, estimates and judgments of the Company’s
management at the time they were prepared and have not been updated to reflect any changes since such
Financial Forecasts were prepared. None of the Company, KKR, GIP or, after consummation of the merger, the
surviving corporation, undertakes any obligation, except as required by law, to update or otherwise revise
the Financial Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing since their preparation, changes in general economic
or industry conditions or the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the
underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.
The following table sets forth a summary of the financial projections made available to the Board, the
Company’s financial advisors and certain parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company,
including KKR and GIP (the “Financial Forecasts”); the summary of the Financial Forecasts is not included
in this proxy statement to induce any CyrusOne stockholder to vote in favor of the approval of the merger
proposal or any other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting:

Morgan Stanley was retained by the Company to act as its financial advisor in connection with a review of
the Company’s strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. The Company selected
Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and
reputation and its knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company. As part of this engagement, the
Board requested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.
On November 14, 2021, Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated November 14, 2021, and that is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex B, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of shares of common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated November 14, 2021, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the
review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. CyrusOne stockholders are urged to, and should, read
the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion is directed to the Board and addresses only the
fairness, from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of common stock of the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and does not constitute an opinion or recommendation as to how any CyrusOne stockholder should vote at
the special meeting. The summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information
of the Company;

reviewed certain internal financial statements and other business, financial and operating data
concerning the Company prepared by the management of the Company;
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company as further
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Financial Forecasts” beginning on page
45;
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company
with senior executives of the Company;
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for shares of common stock;
compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of shares of
common stock with that of certain other publicly traded companies comparable with the Company and
their securities;
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition
transactions;
participated in certain discussions among representatives of the Company and Parent and certain
parties and their financial and legal advisors;
reviewed (i) the merger agreement and (ii) the draft commitment letters from Barclays Bank PLC,
Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. substantially in
the form of the drafts dated November 14, 2021 and the draft commitment letters from the KKR Funds
and the GIP Funds, substantially in the form of the drafts dated November 14, 2021 and certain related
documents; and
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors
as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made
available to it by the Company and Parent, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion.
With respect to the Financial Forecasts, Morgan Stanley assumed that such forecasts were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the
Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the
merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any
waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent would
obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the commitment letters, and that the definitive
merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or
other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or
restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits
expected to be derived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley did not express any view on, and its opinion
did not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby
(other than the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified in the opinion) or any term or aspect of
any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in
connection therewith, including, without limitation, any terms, aspects or implications of any related
transactions. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement as compared to any other alternative business transaction or other business or
financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor did it address the underlying business
decision of the Company to enter into the merger agreement or proceed with the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax, or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a
financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company
and its legal, tax and regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax and regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley
expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the
Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of common stock in the merger. Morgan Stanley was
advised by the Company that the Company has operated in conformity with the requirements for

qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes since its formation as a REIT and Morgan
Stanley assumed that the merger would not adversely affect such status or operations of the Company.
Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the
Company, and was not furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was
necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to Morgan Stanley as of November 14, 2021. Events occurring after such date may affect
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume
any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection
with its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter to the Board dated November 14, 2021.
The following summary is not a complete description of the opinion or the financial analyses performed and
factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with Morgan Stanley’s opinion, nor does the order of
analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses.
Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.
The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion
of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. Furthermore,
mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of
using the data referred to below.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and
relied upon the Financial Forecasts, as described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “- Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 45, and certain financial forecasts based on Wall Street
research.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the Company, which is designed to provide
an implied value of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash
flows and the terminal value of the company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of per share equity values
as of September 30, 2021 for the shares of common stock. Morgan Stanley used estimates from the Financial
Forecasts for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flows for the stub period of the fiscal year
2021 and fiscal years 2022 through 2024 (the “Unlevered Free Cash Flow”), which it calculated by deducting
from Adjusted EBITDA for each such fiscal year (as set forth in greater detail in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “- Financial Forecasts”) stock-based compensation expense, net working capital and net
capital expenditures and making certain further investment adjustments (including for certain categories of
cash and bonus compensation, income tax benefit, professional fees, other income and special items). The
estimates of Unlevered Free Cash Flow were based on the Financial Forecasts (prorated in the case of the
stub fiscal year 2021), and were as follows:

For the period from September 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021.
Morgan Stanley also calculated a range of implied terminal enterprise values of the Company as of December
31, 2024 by applying a range of implied exit multiples of 19.0x to 21.0x to the forecasted Adjusted EBITDA of
the Company for the twelve months ending December 31, 2025 with a midpoint of 20.0x at

TABLE OF CONTENTS
exit. The range of multiples was selected, based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience
with respect to valuations of these types of businesses, using the historical trading performance of the
Company relative to select public peers.
Morgan Stanley then discounted the estimated Unlevered Free Cash Flow and range of estimated terminal
values derived to present value as of September 30, 2021, using rates based on Morgan Stanley’s judgment
of the estimated range of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital of 5.6% to 6.4%, to derive ranges
of implied enterprise values for the Company. From the ranges of implied enterprise values, Morgan Stanley
then deducted the Company’s net debt of approximately $2.96 billion as of September 30, 2021, and added the
value of certain equity investments of the Company of approximately $30 million as of September 30, 2021, to
arrive at a range of enterprise values for the Company, and subsequently derive a range of implied equity
value in respect of the fully diluted share count as of September 30, 2021.
This analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference range for shares of common stock of
$74.99-$89.71 (as compared to the proposed merger consideration of $90.50 per share of common stock).
Trading Performance
Morgan Stanley reviewed the historical trading range of shares of common stock for the 12-month period
ending September 27, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to published market speculation regarding a
potential sale of the Company). Morgan Stanley noted that the low and high closing prices for shares of
common stock during such period were $61.64, on March 4, 2021, and $82.69, on June 10, 2021, respectively,
per share.
Analysts’ Price Target Analysis
Morgan Stanley reviewed publicly available price targets for shares of common stock prepared and
published by over 20 equity research analysts. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for shares of
common stock was $70.00 to $90.00, with a median price target of $80.50 per share of common stock, as of
September 27, 2021, to which Morgan Stanley applied a discount using cost of equity of 7.4% based on the
average of (a) the capital asset pricing based cost of equity using a risk premium assumption of 6.0% and
applicable predicted beta according to MSCI’s Barra’s Risk Models and (b) the median broker reported cost
of equity of 7.5%, resulting in a discounted price target range of $65.99 to $84.84, with a median price target
of $74.94 per share of common stock and a mean price target of $74.43 per share of common stock, in each
case, based on Capital IQ.
The public market trading price targets published by securities research analysts do not necessarily reflect
current market trading prices for shares of common stock. All estimates are subject to uncertainties,
including, but not limited to, the future financial performance of the Company and future financial market
conditions.
Net Asset Value
Morgan Stanley reviewed publicly available net asset value (“NAV”) estimates for shares of common stock
published by those equity research analysts which published publicly available price targets for shares of
common stock. As of September 27, 2021, the range of NAV estimates per share of common stock ranged
from $59.00 to $92.60, with a median NAV estimate of $68.26 per share of common stock and a mean NAV
estimate of $68.69 per share of common stock, in each case based on Capital IQ.
Comparative Public Trading Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading multiples analysis, which is designed to provide an implied
trading value of a company by comparing it to selected companies with similar characteristics to the
company. Morgan Stanley compared certain financial information of the Company with publicly available
information for the selected companies.
Morgan Stanley selected these companies based on its professional judgment and because they are data
center companies with business characteristics that, for purposes of its analysis, Morgan Stanley considered
similar to the business characteristics of the Company.

The selected companies consisted of:
Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR);
Equinix, Inc. (EQIX);
CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR); and
Switch Inc. (SWCH).
Market data for the selected companies was based on closing prices as of November 5, 2021. Balance sheet
data for the selected companies was as of the quarter ended September 30, 2021.
For purposes of this analysis, for each of the selected companies and the Company, Morgan Stanley
calculated:
the aggregate value for each such company (obtained by calculating the sum of equity market
capitalization of such company plus the net debt of such company and other applicable adjustments
such as adjustments for preferred stock and minority interests) as a multiple of its estimated calendar
year 2022 EBITDA (based on Capital IQ consensus estimates) (referred to as “AV / 2022E EBITDA”);
and
the price per share for each such company a multiple of its estimated calendar year 2022 funds from
operations per share (based on Capital IQ consensus estimates) (referred to as “P / 2022E FFO”).
Based on the analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected companies (excluding Equinix, Inc. from
the selected company averages given the difference in its scale and business mix), Morgan Stanley adjusted
the peer multiple range based on the Company’s historical discount to peers and applied the relevant
adjusted multiples to the relevant 2022 metric based on the estimates prepared by Company management and
described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Financial Forecasts” beginning
on page 45 to determine the implied price per share of common stock. For the Company, Morgan Stanley
calculated the same ratios, using both the estimates prepared by Company management and described in
further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 45
and consensus estimates from Capital IQ as of September 27, 2021.

No company in the public trading multiples analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected
companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic
and market conditions affecting the selected companies and other matters (many of which are beyond the
control of the Company), as well as differences in the selected companies’ financial, business and operating
characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather,
this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the
relative values of the selected companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using
the data of the selected companies.
Precedent Transaction Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis on the Company, which is designed to imply a
value of a company based on publicly available financial terms and premiums of selected transactions.
Precedent Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of selected public company
precedent transactions announced from October 23, 2013 to June 7, 2021, in which the targets were REITs

Morgan Stanley calculated the premiums paid in these transactions over the applicable unaffected stock
price of the acquired company (i.e., the percentage by which the price that the acquiring entity paid for the
shares of the target exceeded the unaffected market price of such shares), by comparing the publicly
announced purchase price to the volume-weighted average price for the ten trading days ending five trading
days prior to the announcement of such precedent transactions (or the unaffected date, if applicable).
Morgan Stanley noted that the mean of the premiums paid in the digital infrastructure transaction precedents
was 17.7%. Morgan Stanley noted that the mean of the premiums paid in the REIT transaction precedents
was 20.5%.
Based on the results of this analysis and the premiums paid in precedent transactions as outlined above,
Morgan Stanley applied a premium range of 14.0% to 28.5% based on the observed low and high end of the
range of premiums paid in such precedent transactions, respectively, to the closing price of shares of
common stock on September 27, 2021, the last full trading day prior to published market speculation
regarding a potential sale of the Company, of $72.57. This analysis indicated an implied per share equity
value reference range for common stock of $82.73 to $93.25.
Precedent Data Center Transactions Analysis
Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for certain precedent transactions involving data
center operators, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, between
January 1, 2015 and November 14, 2021. Morgan Stanley selected such comparable transactions because it
determined, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, that they shared certain
characteristics with the merger. The following is a list of the transactions reviewed:

For each selected precedent transaction, where such information was available, Morgan Stanley reviewed
transaction values and calculated the total enterprise value implied for each target company (based on the
consideration paid or proposed to be paid in the selected transaction), as a multiple of the target company’s
(A) last 12 months (“LTM,” for the prior 12-month period, measured from the transaction announcement date,
for which publicly available information was available) Adjusted EBITDA and (B) next 12 months (“NTM,”
estimated for the next 12-month period measured from the transaction announcement date) Adjusted
EBITDA. Financial data of the selected precedent transactions were based on Capital IQ consensus
estimates, public filings and other publicly available information.
From these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted an average NTM EBITDA multiple of 20.7x and an average
LTM EBITDA multiple of 19.9x. Morgan Stanley, based on its professional judgment and experience,
identified the following three precedent transactions as being most relevant to the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement:
Selected Transactions (Acquiror / Target)
Blackstone REIT Operating Partnership; The Blackstone Group Inc. / QTS Realty Trust, Inc. 
Digital Realty Trust, Inc. / InterXion Holding N.V. 
Digital Realty Trust, Inc. / DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc.
Applying the LTM EBITDA multiple from those transactions to the Company’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA
indicated an implied per share equity value reference range for common stock of $77.29 to $97.04.
No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transaction analysis is identical to the Company or the
merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect
to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. These include, among other things, the
impact of competition on the Company’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the
absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company and the
industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies
and the aggregate value and equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact
that certain points in the range of implied present value per share of common stock derived from the
valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the merger consideration is not
necessarily dispositive to Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the merger consideration, but one of many factors
Morgan Stanley considered.
General
In connection with the review of the merger for the Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving
at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any
portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the
process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given
54 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations
resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view of
the actual value of shares of common stock. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous
assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters which are beyond the control of the Company. Any estimates contained in
Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders of shares of common stock of the consideration to be received by
holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, and in connection with the delivery of
its oral opinion, and its subsequent written opinion, to the Board. These analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of common stock might actually trade.
The consideration to be received by holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent (and including other
parties as described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-​Background of the
Merger” beginning on page 31) and was approved by the Board. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the
Board during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to the Board,
nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration to be received by CyrusOne stockholders
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Board when it unanimously (i) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) declared that the merger is advisable
and in the best interests of the Company and of stockholders of the Company on substantially the terms and
conditions set forth in the merger agreement, (iii) directed that the merger be submitted for consideration at
the special meeting and (iv) recommended that the stockholders of the Company approve the merger (as
described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Reasons for the Merger”
beginning on page 41). Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as
determinative of the opinion of the Board with respect to the merger consideration or whether the Board
would have been willing to agree to a different form or amount of consideration.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other
professionals in accordance with its customary practice. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion or
recommendation as to how any stockholder of the Company should vote at the stockholders meeting to be
held in connection with the merger.
Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and
individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting,
trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as
well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its

affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold
long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for
their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Parent, the
Company, KKR, GIP, any of their respective affiliates or any other company, or any currency or commodity,
that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Company with financial advisory
services and the Board with a financial opinion, and the Company has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley an
aggregate fee equal to approximately $68 million, $6 million of which was payable upon the earlier of the
Company entering into a definitive agreement with respect to the merger and Morgan Stanley’s rendering of
its opinion, and approximately $62 million of which is payable upon the closing of the merger. The Company
has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for certain of its expenses, including the fees of outside
counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in performing its services. In addition, the Company has
agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents

If the Company stockholder approval is obtained, the other conditions to the closing of the merger are either
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived and the merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company upon the terms set forth in the merger agreement. As the surviving
corporation in the merger, the Company will continue to exist following the merger as a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.
At the effective time, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time (other than excluded shares) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $90.50 in cash,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Following the merger, all of the common stock will
be beneficially owned by Parent, and none of the current holders of common stock will, by virtue of the
merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the Company, the surviving corporation or
Parent. As a result, the current holders of common stock will no longer benefit from any increase in the value,
nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of the Company. Following the merger, Parent will
benefit from any increase in the Company’s value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in the
Company’s value.

Shares of common stock are currently registered under the Exchange Act and listed on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market under the trading symbol “CONE”. Following the consummation of the merger, shares of
common stock will no longer be traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or any other public market. In
addition, the registration of common stock under the Exchange Act is expected to be terminated, and, upon
such termination, the Company will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with
respect to the common stock.",64,64

In the event that the Company stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated for
any other reason, CyrusOne stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in
connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company, the common
stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the common stock will
continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the Company’s stockholders will continue to own their
shares of common stock and will continue to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they
currently are with respect to ownership of the common stock.
If the merger is not consummated, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on
the future value of your common stock, including the risk that the market price of common stock may decline
to the extent that the current market price of the common stock reflects a market assumption that the merger
will be consummated. If the merger is not consummated, there is no assurance that any other transaction
acceptable to the Company will be offered or that the business, operations, financial condition,

We anticipate that the total funds available to KKR and GIP to consummate the merger (which includes the
funds that will be used to pay the aggregate merger consideration, repay or refinance any indebtedness to be
repaid or refinanced by the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to the merger agreement and pay all fees,
costs and expenses required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub at or prior to the closing of the merger in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) will be approximately $7.047 billion
of equity financing pursuant to the equity commitment letters and an aggregate amount of $12.0 billion of
debt financing. KKR and GIP do not anticipate seeking or requiring additional sources of funding in order to
consummate the merger. Parent has received the equity commitment for the equity financing from the KKR
Funds and the GIP Funds as described below in the section entitled “- Equity Financing” and debt
commitments for the debt financing from the debt financing sources as described below in the section
entitled “- Debt Financing”.
The consummation of the merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of any financing.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the equity commitment letters, the KKR Funds and the GIP Funds have committed to contribute
or cause to be contributed to Parent an aggregate amount in cash equal to $7,047,217,376 solely to fund the
obligations.
Funding of the equity commitment is subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the equity
commitment letters, which include: (i) with respect to the closing obligations, the simultaneous or
immediately subsequent consummation of the closing of the merger and the receipt by Parent of the
proceeds of the contemplated debt financing in accordance with the terms thereof and (ii) with respect to the
expense obligations, such expense obligations becoming due and payable.
The obligation of the KKR Funds and the GIP Funds to fund the equity financing will terminate automatically
and immediately upon the earliest to occur of (i) the consummation of the closing of the merger, (ii) the valid
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, (iii) any payment being made under or in
connection with the guarantees, (iv) the payment in full of the obligations, (v) 18 months after the date of
execution of the equity commitment letters and (vi) the filing or commencement by the Company or any of its
affiliates, or any person acting on their behalf, any action asserting (a) any claim for payment or performance
under or in respect of the merger agreement, the applicable equity commitment letter, the guarantees or
transactions contemplated thereby against the KKR Funds, the GIP Funds, Parent, Merger Sub and/or
certain related parties or (b) any other theory or liability or seeks any remedies against such persons (in the
case of each of clause (a) and clause (b), other than (1) claims by the Company against a guarantor under the
applicable guarantee, (2) claims by the Company against Parent or Merger Sub under the merger agreement,
(3) claims by the Company to cause Parent to specifically enforce a guarantor’s obligations under the
applicable equity commitment letter to which such guarantor is party and (4) claims by the Company against
KKR or GIP under the applicable non-disclosure agreement, other than, with respect to clause (v), any action
by the Company or any of its affiliates seeking specific performance of Parent’s obligation to fund the equity
commitment in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

and subject only to the conditions set forth in the equity commitment letters.
The Company is an express beneficiary of the right granted to Parent to specific performance under the
equity commitment letters and is entitled to enforce Parent’s rights to specific performance of the KKR
Funds and the GIP Funds to fund all or any portion of their respective equity financing obligations under the
equity commitment letters, subject to the terms thereof, if the Company is entitled to specific performance of
Parent’s obligation to cause the equity commitment to be funded pursuant to the merger agreement.
Debt Financing
In connection with entering into the merger agreement, Parent received a debt commitment letter, dated
November 14, 2021 (the “debt commitment letter” and, together with the equity commitment letters, the
“commitment letters”), from the debt financing sources. Pursuant to the debt commitment letter, the debt
financing sources have committed to provide, severally but not jointly, the credit facilities.
The commitments of the debt financing sources under the debt commitment letter are subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver by the applicable debt financing sources) of certain conditions precedent, including,
without limitation:
the merger shall have been prior to or, substantially concurrently with the initial borrowing under the
credit facilities shall be, consummated in all material respects in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement, without giving effect to certain material amendments or waivers absent the consent
of the applicable debt financing sources;
since September 30, 2021, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect;
prior to or substantially simultaneously with the initial borrowing under the credit facilities, the
refinancing of certain existing Company indebtedness shall be consummated;
the consummation of the equity financing shall have been made, or substantially concurrently with
the borrowings under the credit facilities shall be made;
all documents and instruments required to create or perfect the security interests contemplated under
the credit facilities shall be fully executed and delivered by the applicable parties and, if applicable, in
proper form for filing; and
other customary conditions precedent set forth in the debt commitment letter.
The commitments under the debt commitment letter terminate automatically on the earliest to occur of: (i)
prior to the consummation of the merger, the termination of the merger agreement by Parent (or Parent’s
affiliates) in accordance with its terms (other than with respect to provisions therein that expressly survive
termination), (ii) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is five business days after the Outside Date
(as defined in the merger agreement as of November 14, 2021, without giving effect to any extension of the
Outside Date pursuant to Section 8.08 of the merger agreement) and (iii) the consummation of the merger
without the funding of the credit facilities.
Guarantees
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the guarantees, the KKR Funds and the GIP Funds have
guaranteed certain payment obligations of Parent under the merger agreement, subject to an aggregate cap
of $409,250,000 for the KKR Funds and an aggregate cap of $409,250,000 for the GIP Funds for payment of
the guaranteed obligations.
Each guarantee is irrevocable, and will not terminate until the earliest to occur of (i) the consummation of the
merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, (ii) 90 days following the valid termination of
the merger agreement unless by such date the Company has delivered a notice with respect to the
guaranteed obligations, in which case the applicable guarantee will automatically terminate when such claim
is resolved or otherwise finally satisfied, (iii) the receipt by the Company of payment in respect of the
guaranteed obligations and (iv) 18 months after the date of execution of the respective guarantee unless

The Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The members of the Board
were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the merger proposal
and recommend that CyrusOne stockholders approve the merger proposal.
The Company’s executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are David Ferdman (Interim
President and Chief Executive Officer), Katherine Motlagh (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer), John Hatem (Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer) and Robert Jackson (Executive
Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary). In accordance with SEC rules, this discussion also covers
former executive officers of the Company who served as executive officers at any time since January 1, 2020,
which consist of Bruce Duncan (former President and Chief Executive Officer), Gary Wojtaszek (former
President and Chief Executive Officer), Venkatesh Durvasula (former Interim President and Chief Executive
Officer), Diane Morefield (former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) and Kevin Timmons
(former Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer) (collectively, the “Former Executive
Officers”). In addition, in accordance with SEC rules, this disclosure is required to cover Michael A. Klayko,
who served as a director of the Company in fiscal year 2020, but since he no longer serves as a director of
the Company, and to the Company’s knowledge does not have any interests in the merger that are different
from those of a stockholder, he has been omitted from the disclosure below.
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
For information regarding beneficial ownership of shares of common stock, which generally excludes the
Company equity awards described below, other than Company restricted share awards, by each of the
Company’s directors and executive officers and all of such directors and executive officers as a group, please
see the section entitled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management”, beginning on
page 92. Each of the Company’s directors and executive officers and each of the Former Executive Officers
will be entitled to receive, for each share of common stock he or she holds, the same per share merger
consideration in cash in the same manner as other CyrusOne stockholders.
As described further in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Company Equity Awards”
beginning on page 72, each Company equity award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be
converted into the merger consideration for each share of common stock subject to such Company equity
award, less the exercise price in the case of Company stock options, and assuming the achievement of all
applicable performance criteria at the maximum level, plus the amount of any accrued dividend equivalents
with respect to any restricted stock unit that remain unpaid as of the effective time. In the case of Company
equity awards granted prior to the date of the merger agreement or granted to non-employee directors at any
time, such amounts will vest and become payable at the effective time. In the case of Company equity awards
granted after the date of the merger agreement (other than awards granted to non-employee directors), such
amounts will remain subject to any time-vesting criteria that applied to the applicable Company equity award,
including with respect to any accelerated vesting terms upon a qualifying

termination of employment. For company equity awards subject to performance criteria, the maximum level of
performance is 200% or 300% of target performance, as applicable.
The following table sets forth the value of the Company equity awards held by each of the Company’s
directors, executive officers and Former Executive Officers as of December 23, 2021, the latest practicable
date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and the cash amounts payable (on
a pre-tax basis) in respect thereof in connection with the merger. The values in the table below have been
determined assuming that (i) all Company equity awards are valued based on the merger consideration of
$90.50 per share, (ii) all Company equity awards subject to performance criteria have such criteria satisfied at
the maximum levels, (iii) the merger closes on June 30, 2022, which is the assumed closing date only for
purposes of this compensation-related disclosure and (iv) the individuals included in the table below do not
receive any additional grants of Company equity awards or forfeit any Company equity awards prior to June
30, 2022; however, such values do reflect the expected vesting of Company equity awards prior to such date.
The values below also do not reflect any awards that were accelerated and vested in accordance with the
280G mitigation actions described below. No director or executive officer holds Company stock options or
Company restricted shares.

Company ESPP as of such date, no participant can increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll
deduction election in effect as of such date for such Purchase Period(s) and no new participants can
participate in such Purchase Period(s); (ii) no new Purchase Period will commence under the Company ESPP
on or after such date; (iii) any Purchase Period under the Company ESPP that does not end prior to the

respect to such Purchase Period, in which case any shares of common stock purchased pursuant to such
Purchase Period will be treated the same as all other shares of common stock in the merger; and (iv)

the extent the Company’s executive officers participate in the Company ESPP, they will be treated in the same
manner described above.
Severance Entitlements
Employment Agreement with Mr. Ferdman
Mr. Ferdman is currently subject to an employment agreement with a term that ends on January 29, 2022 (the
“Ferdman Term Date”) and that provides that, if his employment is terminated without “Cause”
60 
(1)
(2)
(2)
( 3)
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or Mr. Ferdman resigns for “Good Reason”  (each, as defined in Mr. Ferdman’s employment agreement) at any
time, he will be eligible to receive, subject to Mr. Ferdman’s execution of a release of claims in favor of the
Company, (i) full vesting of his Company restricted share award granted to him in his capacity as an
employee and (ii) provided that Mr. Ferdman provides transition services to the Company through the
Ferdman Term Date, the base salary and annual bonus that Mr. Ferdman would have otherwise earned
through the Ferdman Term Date if his employment had not terminated. In addition, if Mr. Ferdman’s
employment is terminated for any other reason, other than for Cause, he will be entitled to a pro-rated portion
of any annual bonus he would have otherwise earned through the Ferdman Term Date if his employment had
not terminated.
Mr. Ferdman’s employment agreement does not provide for any enhanced payments or benefits in
connection with a change in control of the Company such as the merger, but his Company restricted share
award agreement provides that, in the event that any payment or benefit payable to Mr. Ferdman would
constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), then Mr. Ferdman will either receive all such payments and benefits in full or such
payments and benefits will be reduced to the greatest amount that does not trigger the excise tax pursuant to
Section 4999 of the Code, whichever results in the greater after-tax amount for Mr. Ferdman (a “280G best-net
cutback”).
Severance Agreements with Ms. Motlagh and Mr. Hatem and Employment Agreement with Mr. Jackson
Ms. Motlagh and Messrs. Jackson and Hatem are each party to an individual agreement with the Company
that provides that if the applicable executive’s employment is terminated without “Cause” or he or she
resigns for “Good Reason”  (in the case of Ms. Motlagh and Mr. Hatem) or as a result of a “Constructive
Termination”  (in the case of Mr. Jackson) (each, as defined in the applicable agreement), in each case, during
the one-year period beginning on a “change in control” of the Company, which will include the
consummation of the merger, he or she will be eligible to receive, subject to his or her execution of a release
of claims in favor of the Company: (i) a cash lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of the executive’s
base salary and annual target bonus, increased by an amount equal to the interest that would be earned on
such amounts over a 60-day period, based on an annual interest rate of 3.5%; (ii) accelerated vesting of all
time-based equity awards; (iii) continued health benefits for one year (or less, if the executive becomes
eligible for another group health plan), with the Company to pay or reimburse any costs in excess of the
current active employee rate; and (iv) an additional cash payment sufficient to purchase comparable life
insurance coverage for one year. All of the executive agreements provide for a 280G best-net cutback.
The severance payments and benefits described above are generally subject to the applicable executive’s
compliance with his or her obligations under any restrictive covenant agreement entered into with the
Company, which generally provide for one-year post-termination restrictions on competing with the
Company, accepting employment with customers or vendors or soliciting the Company’s employees or
customers, and requires the executive to generally not disclose the Company’s confidential information at
any time.
Arrangements with KKR or GIP
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers has entered
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with KKR, GIP, Parent or any of their affiliates regarding
employment, or providing for any compensation or benefits, following the effective time, and the merger is
not conditioned upon any such agreement, arrangement or understanding being entered into.
Retention Bonuses
The Company has established a cash-based deal retention bonus program for the benefit of certain Company
employees in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Pursuant to the program, Messrs. Ferdman,
Hatem and Jackson and Ms. Motlagh received deal retention bonuses in an amount equal to $4,000,000,
$1,000,000, $1,000,000 and $500,000, respectively. In the case of Mr. Ferdman, the size of his deal retention
bonus is reflective, in part, of the fact that the significant majority of his equity awards were scheduled to
vest in December 2021 and January 2022. Fifty percent of each bonus is payable upon the closing of the
merger and the remaining fifty percent will become payable 90 days following the closing of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the merger, subject to continued employment through the relevant payment date, although payment of the
second installment will also be made upon a termination that would otherwise entitle the recipient to
severance compensation.
Continuing Employee Benefits
The merger agreement provides for certain customary protections regarding the compensation and benefits
of employees of the Company, including the Company’s executive officers, during their employment with the
Company and its affiliates following the effective time for a period of up to one year. These provisions are
described in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Employee Benefits Matters”
beginning on page 86.
Treatment of Annual Bonuses
The merger agreement provides that Parent will pay an annual bonus to each Continuing Employee who is
otherwise eligible to receive an annual bonus for the performance year in which the effective time occurs at
the same time that such bonuses are paid in the ordinary course of business (the “Closing Year Bonus”). In
the event an employee’s, including an executive officer’s, employment is terminated under circumstances
that would qualify him or her to receive severance, such employee will receive a pro-rated Closing Year
Bonus based on the greater of (i) the amount such employee would be entitled in connection with the
applicable severance arrangement and (ii) his or her target annual bonus, except that, if the termination
occurs during the second half of the Company’s fiscal year, the amount under clause (ii) will be equal to the
projected actual annual cash bonus he or she would have received for such fiscal year based on accruals for
bonuses in the Company’s financial statements, if greater.
Section 280G Mitigation Actions
As described above, all executive officers are subject to a 280G best-net cutback. Based on a preliminary
analysis conducted after entering into the merger agreement, Messrs. Ferdman, Hatem and Jackson and Ms.
Motlagh would each potentially trigger, absent any mitigating actions, the adverse tax consequences
imposed by Section 280G of the Code in connection with the merger, which consist of a 20% excise tax on
certain payments that may be received by the executives, significantly reducing their retentive value to the
Company, and the possibility that the Company may lose the benefit of a tax deduction with respect to such
payments. Therefore, to mitigate the expected impact of Section 280G of the Code, and to preserve the
retentive value of the executives’ equity and other compensation, as well as the ability of the Company to
potentially claim a tax deduction in respect of such payments, the following actions were approved in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, effective as of December 20, 2021, in order to increase
each executive’s threshold for triggering Section 280G of the Code:
accelerating the payment of a portion of each executive officer’s annual bonus for the 2021
performance year that otherwise would be paid in early 2022 ($1,200,000 for Mr. Ferdman, $600,000 for
Ms. Motlagh, $540,000 for Mr. Hatem and $474,000 for Mr. Jackson);
accelerating the payment of certain time-vesting restricted shares and RSUs for all executive officers
other than Mr. Hatem (who does not hold any such awards), which were either scheduled to vest in
approximately two months or represent a small portion of future equity vestings ($3,177,247 for Mr.
Ferdman, $1,049,236 for Ms. Motlagh and $401,632 for Mr. Jackson, in each case, based on the closing
price for shares of common stock on December 20, 2021 of $89.51); and
for Mr. Jackson only, accelerating the payment of performance-vesting RSUs scheduled to vest in
February 2022 ($1,365,207, based on the closing price for shares of common stock on December 20,
2021 of $89.51).
Where compensation subject to performance conditions was accelerated, the acceleration was based on an
assumed level of performance that the Company determined was substantially certain to be achieved. If
actual performance would have resulted in a greater amount being earned, the executive will be entitled to a
true-up once actual performance is determined. All the foregoing actions were made subject to a clawback in
favor of the Company, whereby the executive will be required to reimburse the Company if it is subsequently

determined that the amounts accelerated would not have been earned (i.e., due to the failure to satisfy any
service- or, if applicable, performance-based vesting criteria).
Director and Officer Indemnification
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, members of the Board and executive officers of the Company
will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies following the merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the merger
agreement relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Indemnification” beginning on page 86.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company’s
named executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to
the merger for which payment is not conditioned upon a termination or resignation of such executive officer
(i.e., on a “single-trigger” basis) or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following the
merger (i.e., on a “double-trigger” basis). The holders of shares of common stock are being asked to approve,
on a non-binding, advisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is
advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the merger
proposal is approved by the holders of shares of common stock and the merger is consummated, the
compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject
only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above
under “- Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K.
The estimated values are based on (i) an assumption that the merger is consummated on June 30, 2022, (ii)
the per share merger consideration of $90.50, (iii) the named executive officers’ salary and target bonus
amounts as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, (iv) the number of unvested Company equity
awards held by the named executive officers as of December 23, 2021 (in particular, the amounts below
exclude awards that vested as a result of the 280G mitigation actions described above), the latest practicable
date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, less any awards expected to vest in
the ordinary course prior to June 30, 2022, and assuming no additional grants or forfeitures of Company
equity awards prior to June 30, 2022, and (v) an assumption that each named executive officer experiences a
termination of employment immediately following the consummation of the merger under circumstances that
entitle such named executive officer to receive severance (i.e., a termination without “Cause” or resignation
for “Good Reason”). As such, the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that
may or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect
certain compensation actions that may occur before consummation of the merger. As a result, the actual
amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth
below.
The amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of a
280G best-net cutback, which all named executive officers are subject to; therefore, actual payments to the
named executive officers may be less than the amounts indicated below.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Wojtaszek and Ms. Morefield retained a portion of their Company equity awards that are subject to
performance vesting criteria, with vesting subject to the satisfaction of such performance criteria. Based
on the assumptions above, the estimated value of such Company equity awards is $9,611,915 in the
aggregate. Such individuals will not receive any other severance or enhanced benefits in connection
with the merger as a result of their status as a former executive officer of the Company. Mr. Durvasula
does not hold any unvested Company equity awards, and therefore will not receive any severance or
enhanced benefits in connection with the merger as a result of his status as a former executive officer of
the Company.
The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated value of (i) cash lump sum severance
payments that would be provided to the named executive officer upon a termination of employment by
the Company without “Cause” or by the named executive officer for “Good Reason” or as a result of a
“Constructive Termination”, in each case, within one year following the closing of the merger (as
described in the section entitled “- Severance Entitlements”), (ii) a pro-rated Closing Year Bonus (as
described in the section entitled “- Treatment of Annual Bonuses”), which is assumed to be paid based
on target performance and (iii) a cash-based deal retention bonus (as described in the section entitled “-
Retention Bonuses”). Other than Mr. Ferdman, the value of cash severance for each named executive
officer consists of two times the sum of his or her base salary and target bonus amount, increased by
the interest, based on a rate of 3.5%, that would be payable over a 60-day period. Half of each named
executive officer’s cash-based deal retention bonus is “single-trigger” as such amounts will be payable
on the effective time regardless of whether or not the executive’s employment is terminated. Each named
executive officer’s cash severance payments, Closing Year Bonus and the second half of the cash-based
retention bonus are “double-trigger”, as such payments will not be payable solely as a result of the
occurrence of the effective time. In the case of the cash severance and Closing Year Bonus, such
amounts will only be payable in the event of a qualifying termination of employment, subject to the
terms and conditions described in the section entitled “- Severance Entitlements”. In the case of the
second half of the cash-based retention bonuses, such amounts will be payable 90 days following the
Closing or upon an earlier termination that would otherwise entitle the recipient to severance
compensation, as described in the section entitled “- Retention Bonuses”. Although Mr. Ferdman’s
employment agreement provides for certain severance payments as described above in the section
entitled “- Employment Agreement with Mr. Ferdman”, under the current terms of his employment
agreement, Mr. Ferdman would not be entitled to any severance if his employment is terminated for any
reason on or following January 29, 2022. Set forth below are the separate values for the cash severance
payments, pro-rated Closing Year Bonuses and deal retention bonuses reflected in the table above.

The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated aggregate value of the named executive
officers’ unvested Company equity awards. As described in the sections entitled “The Merger - 
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Treatment of Company
Equity Awards” and “The Merger - Treatment of Company Equity Awards,” at the effective time, each
Company equity award will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive the merger consideration
with respect to each share of common stock subject to the Company equity award, less the exercise
price in the case of Company stock options, and with the number of shares of common stock subject to
any awards subject to performance-criteria determined based on achievement of such criteria at the
maximum level, with such amounts in respect of Company equity awards granted prior to the date of the
merger agreement payable at the effective time. Such amounts in respect of Company equity awards
granted after the date of the merger agreement will remain subject to any time-vesting criteria that
applied to the applicable Company equity award, including with respect to any accelerated vesting
terms upon a qualifying termination of employment. As of the date of this proxy statement, all Company
equity awards held by named executive officers were granted prior to the date of the merger agreement
and no awards are assumed to have been granted following the date of the merger agreement, and

CyrusOne Inc._20211230_DEFM14A_19745922_4359686.Pdf,Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders with
respect to the disposition of common stock pursuant to the merger. It is not intended to be a complete
analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and does not
address consequences to holders of LTIP units or Company equity awards. This discussion is based upon
the provisions of the Code and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth
herein. The Internal Revenue Service may not agree with the tax consequences described in this discussion.
This discussion assumes that holders of common stock hold their shares as capital assets within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not
address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of common stock in light
of such holder’s particular circumstances, nor does it discuss the special considerations applicable to
holders of Common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for
example, financial institutions or broker-dealers, mutual funds, partnerships or other pass-through entities
and their partners or members, tax-exempt organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance
companies, dealers in securities or non-U.S. currencies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market
method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, U.S.
expatriates, holders who acquired their shares of common stock through the exercise of stock options or
otherwise as compensation, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, holders who hold their shares of
common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as
defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, accrual method holders who prepare an
“applicable financial statement”  (as defined in Section 451 of the Code) and holders who own or have owned
(directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or more of the common stock (by vote or value) outstanding. In
addition, this discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or
non-U.S. jurisdiction or U.S. federal non-income tax consequences (e.g., the federal estate or gift tax or the
application of the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code).
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds common stock,
the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and
activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding common stock, you should consult
your own tax advisor.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
All holders should consult their own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including the
application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for
shares of common stock pursuant to the merger.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of common stock, that is,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;
a trust if (1) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States
and one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in effect under
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; or
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity classified as a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) of common stock that is not a U.S. holder.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger and such U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock converted into cash pursuant to the merger. Such gain or
loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder’s holding
period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term capital gains for certain non-
corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal income
taxation. A U.S. holder who has held shares of our common stock for less than six months at the time of the
merger, taking into account certain holding period rules and who recognizes a loss on the exchange of such
shares of common stock in the merger will be treated as recognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of
any capital gain dividends received from us, or such holder’s share of any designated retained capital gains,
with respect to such shares. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder
acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or at different prices, such U.S. holder must
determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to each block of common
stock.
A U.S. holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding
(at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to the merger, unless such holder properly
establishes an exemption or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise complies with the
applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules can be refunded or credited against a U.S. holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to
the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the
case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which
case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S.
holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. corporation, such corporation may be subject
66 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
to branch profits tax at the rate of 30% on the effectively connected gain (or such lower rate as may
be specified by an applicable income tax treaty);
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days
or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-
U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax at a 30% rate (or a lower applicable income tax treaty rate)
on any gain derived from the disposition of the common stock pursuant to the merger (other than
gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business), which may be offset by U.S. source capital
losses; or
the Company stock constitutes a “United States real property interest”  (“USRPI”) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”).
If our shares of common stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, a non-U.S. holder would be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on any gain or loss recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for such shares of
common stock in the merger on a net basis at applicable U.S. graduated rates in the same manner as a U.S.
holder, and such cash consideration may also be subject to the U.S. federal withholding tax under FIRPTA at
a rate of 15%. A non-U.S. holder’s shares of common stock generally will not constitute a USRPI, and gain
recognized by a non-U.S. holder upon receipt of cash in exchange for our shares of common stock pursuant
to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or U.S. federal withholding tax under
FIRPTA, if: (1) we are a “domestically controlled REIT”, defined generally as a REIT in which, at all times
during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of the shares was held directly or indirectly by non-
U.S. persons; or (2) our shares of common stock are “regularly traded”  (within the meaning of applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations) on an established securities market at the effective time (and the non-U.S. holder
holds 10% or less of the total fair market value of such class of shares at all times during the shorter of (x)
the five year period ending with the effective date of the merger and (y) the non-U.S. holder’s holding period
for the shares). We believe we are, and we expect to be at the effective time, a “domestically controlled
REIT”, but no assurances can be given that we are or will remain a domestically controlled REIT. In addition,
we believe that our shares of common stock are, and will be at the effective time, regularly traded on an
established securities market (within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulation).
Non-U.S. holders who hold, or have held during specified periods, directly, indirectly, or constructively, more
than 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock generally are subject to special rules under FIRPTA.
Such non-U.S. holders may be subject to tax on any gain recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for
their shares of common stock pursuant to the merger, and withholding agents may withhold on such cash
consideration. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the
foregoing rules in light of their particular facts and circumstances, the procedures for claiming treaty benefits
or otherwise establishing an exemption from U.S. withholding tax with respect to any portion of the cash
consideration payable to them pursuant to the merger.
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding
will apply with respect to the cash received by such holder pursuant to the merger, unless such non-U.S.
holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual
knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person as defined under the Code) or such
holder otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a
non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such non-U.S. holder furnishes the
required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.",73,75

The Company has historically declared and paid a cash dividend each quarter. On October 27, 2021, the
Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock for the quarter ended
December 31, 2021, which will be paid on January 7, 2022 to CyrusOne stockholders of record at the close of
business on January 3, 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company and the Company
Operating Partnership are prohibited from authorizing, declaring, setting aside for payment or paying any
dividends on, or making any other distributions (whether in cash, stock or property or any combination
thereof) in respect of, any of their capital stock, partnership interests or other equity or

voting interests, other than (1) regular quarterly cash dividends payable by the Company at a quarterly rate
not to exceed $0.52 per share of common stock, provided that the record date with respect to any such
quarterly dividends shall be consistent with historical record dates from fiscal year 2021 (or the next
business day if such record date is not a business day), (2) dividends and distributions by a non-wholly
owned subsidiary in accordance with the requirements of the organizational documents of such subsidiary
and (3) accrual and payment of dividend equivalents with respect to awards under the Company’s existing

The Company is also permitted to authorize, declare and pay any special dividends to CyrusOne
stockholders during the term of the merger agreement that, in the reasonable discretion of the Board, on the
advice of legal counsel, are necessary or advisable to maintain our status as a REIT or to avoid the payment
of income or excise tax or to preserve the tax status of any subsidiary (with any such special dividend
resulting in a corresponding decrease to the merger consideration).
Dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of the Board. The Board may change the Company’s
dividend policy at any time and there can be no assurance as to amount or timing of dividends in the future.",75,76

certificated shares in book-entry form that formerly represented shares of common stock, in each case
together with the associated letter of transmittal, duly completely and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the paying agent.

certificate has been stolen or destroyed. A holder of common stock will have to provide an affidavit to that
fact and, if required by Parent, post a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent directs as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, upon which the paying agent shall
issue the merger consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of common stock represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate.",81,81

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, the Board,
or any duly authorized committee thereof, may:
make an adverse recommendation change if an intervening event has occurred, and the Board or any
duly authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors’ duties under applicable law (taking into account all adjustments to the terms of the merger
agreement that have been offered by Parent pursuant to Section 5.02 of the merger agreement); or
in response to a bona fide takeover proposal after November 14, 2021, which did not result, directly or
indirectly, from a breach of the merger agreement that the Board or any duly authorized committee
thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, constitutes a superior proposal (taking into account all adjustments to the terms of the
merger agreement that have been offered by Parent pursuant to Section 5.02 of the merger agreement),
effect an adverse recommendation change or, subject to compliance with the merger agreement,
terminate the merger agreement if the Board or any duly authorized committee thereof has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the failure
to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable law.
Prior to taking any of the actions set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph,
the Company must give Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice of its intention to
make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement, as applicable (which
notice shall, if applicable, (x) specify the basis for such adverse recommendation change, (y) specify
the intervening event or the identity of the party making such superior proposal and the material
terms and conditions thereof and (z) a copy of the most current version of the proposed agreement

after providing such notice and prior to effecting such adverse recommendation change or taking
such action, the Company must have negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in

Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of the merger agreement,
the commitment letters and the guarantees in response to such intervening event or superior
proposal, as applicable; and
following the end of such notice period, the Board or any duly authorized committee thereof must
have considered in good faith any changes to the merger agreement, the commitment letters and the
guarantees in a manner that would form the basis for such binding offer if accepted by the Company,

the failure to make an adverse recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement, as
applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under
applicable law even if such changes were to be given effect and, in the case of a superior proposal,
that such superior proposal would continue to constitute a superior proposal if such changes were to
be given effect;
provided, that in the event of any material modifications to such intervening event with respect to the bullets
above under the sentence pertaining to actions the Board, or any committee thereof, may take at any time
prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, in the event of any change in price or material revision

Under the merger agreement, the Company has agreed to allow Parent a period of 15 consecutive business
days to market the debt financing. The marketing period commences upon the date Parent has received
certain required financial information (provided, that such period will not be deemed to have commenced

have been satisfied). The marketing period shall end on any earlier date on which the debt financing has
been obtained.
Efforts
The merger agreement provides that each of Parent and Merger Sub will use, and will cause their affiliates to

Parent and Merger Sub may not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to or permit any
termination of or amendment or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the
financing documents or the definitive agreements relating to the financing of the merger if such termination,

amount of the financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) or
(2) reduce the amount of debt financing unless, in each case, (I) the equity financing is increased by a
corresponding amount no later than the date of such termination, amendment, modification or waiver and,
after giving effect thereto, certain representations and warranties in the merger agreement shall be true and
correct, or (II) such reduction is undertaken in connection with a purchase price reduction under the merger
agreement in accordance with the debt commitment letter and the remaining commitments under the debt

The merger agreement provides that for a period of one year following the effective time, (or, if earlier, the
termination date of the applicable employee), Parent will provide each employee of the Company as of
immediately prior to the effective time (each, a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) a base salary or wage rate, as
applicable, and target short- and long-term incentive opportunities that are no less favorable, in each case,
than those in effect immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) severance benefits that are no less favorable
than those that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee under the applicable severance
plans and arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the effective time and (iii) other employee benefit
plans and arrangements (other than base salary, wage rate, short- and long-term incentive opportunities,
severance benefits, defined benefit pension or post- termination or retiree health or welfare benefits) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the effective time; provided that, in lieu of providing equity or equity- related incentives, Parent may
instead satisfy such obligations by providing the cash equivalent thereof. Notwithstanding anything in the
merger agreement to the contrary, the terms and conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee
covered by a collective bargaining, works council or other similar agreement will continue to be governed by
such agreement in accordance with its terms.
Parent will honor in accordance with their terms all of the Company’s compensation and benefit plans,
programs, agreements and arrangements in effect at the effective time (subject to any rights to terminate,
amend or modify such plans, programs, agreements or arrangements in accordance with their terms, but after
giving effect to any provisions relating to a “change in control” or “change of control”  (or term of similar
import)). Parent has acknowledged in the merger agreement that the merger will constitute a “change in
control” or “change of control”  (or other term of similar import) for purposes of the Company’s
compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements.
The merger agreement provides that Parent will pay the Closing Year Bonus to each Continuing Employee
who is otherwise eligible to receive such Closing Year Bonus, with the Closing Year Bonuses (i) based on the
bonus plan and targets in effect immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) determined reasonably and in
good faith in the ordinary course of business and (iii) paid at the same time that annual bonuses are typically
paid. In the event a Continuing Employee’s employment is terminated under circumstances that would
qualify him or her to receive severance, such Continuing Employee will receive a pro-rated Closing Year
Bonus equal to the greater of (A) the amount such employee would be entitled in connection with the
applicable severance arrangement and (B) his or her target annual bonus, except that, if the termination
occurs during the second half of the Company’s fiscal year, the amount under clause (B) will be equal to the
projected actual annual cash bonus he or she would have received for such fiscal year based on accruals for
bonuses in the Company’s financial statements, if greater.
In addition, the Company has agreed that, prior to making any broad-based communication or written
communications (including website postings) pertaining to employment, compensation or benefit matters

On September 27, 2021, the last full trading day prior to published market speculation regarding a potential
sale of the Company, the closing price for shares of common stock was $72.57 per share. The $90.50 per share
to be paid for each share of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement represents a premium of
approximately 25% over the closing price on September 27, 2019. On December 27, 2021, the latest practicable
trading day before the filing of this proxy statement, the reported closing price for shares of common stock
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $89.99. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations

As of the close of business on the record date, there were 129,555,316 shares of common stock outstanding
and entitled to vote, held by 105 CyrusOne stockholders of record. The number of holders is based upon the
actual number of holders registered in our records at such date and excludes holders of shares in “street

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement during the pendency of the merger, the Company is permitted
to pay regular quarterly dividends, at a quarterly rate not to exceed $0.52 per share of common stock, to
CyrusOne stockholders, provided that the record date with respect to any such quarterly dividends shall be
consistent with historical record dates from fiscal year 2021 (or the next business day if such record date is

The SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more CyrusOne stockholders
sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those CyrusOne stockholders.
This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding”, potentially means extra convenience for
CyrusOne stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Brokers with account holders who are CyrusOne stockholders of the Company may be “householding” proxy
materials. A single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple CyrusOne stockholders sharing an address
unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected CyrusOne stockholders. If you have
received notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address, such
“householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any
time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate proxy
statement, please notify your broker and direct your written request to CyrusOne Inc., Attention: Investor
Relations Department, 2850 N. Harwood St., Suite 2200, Dallas, TX 75201 or call 972-350-0060. CyrusOne

Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) or of non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock held in

Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry
Share that formerly represented the Company Common Stock held by any record holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time for cancelation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with such letter’s instructions (and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x)
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered and shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate and Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
such surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II. No interest shall be paid or
accrue for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on any cash payable
hereunder.
(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in
respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that represented ownership of shares of Company Common Stock and Book-Entry Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be stockholders of the Company, and
shall have no rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.
(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) which has not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for,
and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, without interest. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there are no existing circumstances that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification status or otherwise adversely affect such Company Benefit Plan’s qualified status. There
are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened audits, investigations, litigation,
claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against or otherwise with respect any
Company Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto and no audit or other proceeding by a Governmental
Authority is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material

ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (ii) “multiemployer plan”  (as defined in Section 3(37) or Section

“multiple employer plan”  (within the meaning of Section 210 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code) or
a “multiple employer welfare arrangement”  (as such term is defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA). Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any current or contingent liability or obligation by reason

in each case, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

benefits under any material Company Benefit Plan, (iii) limit or restrict the right to amend, terminate or
transfer the assets of any material Company Benefit Plan on or following the Effective Time or (iv) result
in any payment that could be characterized as a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section

respect of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is primarily based outside of the

qualify for special tax treatment or be registered, meet all the requirements for such special tax treatment,

accordance with the Financing Letters and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in

Financing Letters required to be satisfied by it, that the conditions thereof will not otherwise be satisfied at
or prior to the Closing Date or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available on the Closing Date.

obligations of the Guarantors to fund the full amount of the Equity Financing and the lenders to fund the full

Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer, as applicable, and the identity of the Person or group of Persons

execute or enter into) any Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in

the contrary, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, but not after, the Board of Directors
of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof may in accordance with this Section 5.02(d) (I)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change if an Intervening Event has occurred, and the Board of
Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable Law, taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to this Section
5.02(d) or (II) in response to a bona fide Takeover Proposal after the date hereof, which did not result,
directly or indirectly, from a breach of this Section 5.02, that the Board of Directors of the Company or
any duly authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, taking into account all adjustments
to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.02(d), effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or, subject to compliance with the terms hereof, terminate this
Agreement and take action pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or
any duly authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’
duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company or any
duly authorized committee thereof shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any action set
forth in the preceding clause (I) or clause (II) unless (1) the Company has given Parent at least three
Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to make an Adverse Recommendation
A-37 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Change or take action pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii), as applicable (which notice shall, if applicable, (x)
specify the basis for such Adverse Recommendation Change, (y) specify the Intervening Event or the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof and
(z) a copy of the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is
to be consummated and any other material documents and material correspondence in respect of such
Superior Proposal), (2) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation
Change or taking such action pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii), the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the
extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect
revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Guarantees in response to such
Intervening Event or Superior Proposal, as applicable, (3) following the end of such notice period, the
Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Guarantees in a manner that
would form the basis for such binding offer if accepted by the Company, and shall have determined,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to take action pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii), as applicable, would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable Law even if such
changes were to be given effect and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, that such Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect; provided,
further, with respect to clause (I), in the event of any material modifications to such Intervening Event,
and with respect to clause (II), in the event of any change in price or material revision or material
amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent, and the notice period contemplated by this Section 5.02(d) will recommence for
two Business Days from the date of delivery of such new written notice.
(e) Nothing in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board
of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to
the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law or if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that
the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to make such disclosure would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their duties to the Company under applicable
Law (it being agreed that the issuance of a “stop, look and listen” or similar statement of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, pending disclosure of its position,
shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change); provided, however, that neither the
Company, the Board of Directors of the Company nor any duly authorized committee thereof shall,
except as expressly permitted by Section 5.02(d), effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, including
in any disclosure document or communication filed or publicly issued or made in conjunction with
compliance with such requirements.
(f) As used in this Agreement, “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means (x) any confidentiality
agreement entered into by the Company from and after the date of this Agreement that contains
confidentiality provisions that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than
those contained in the more restrictive of the Confidentiality Agreements, except that such
confidentiality agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill provisions or otherwise restrict
the making of or amendment or modification to Takeover Proposals; provided, further, that such
confidentiality agreement shall not contain any provision requiring the Company or its Subsidiaries to
pay or reimburse the counterparty’s expenses and does not contain any provision that would prevent
the Company from complying with its obligation to provide any disclosure to Parent required by this
Section 5.02, or (y) any confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, it
being understood that the Company, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled to waive or release any
preexisting explicit or implicit standstill provisions or similar agreements with any Person or group of
Persons to the extent necessary to allow for a confidential Takeover Proposal to be made to the Board of
Directors of the Company so long as the Company promptly (and in any event within one Business Day
thereafter) notifies Parent thereof (including the identity of such counterparty) after granting any such
waiver or release and the Board of Directors of the Company determines prior to the grant of such
waiver or release in

good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors’ duties under applicable Law.

Subsidiaries of the Company owning such assets, or to which 20% or more of the Company’s revenues
or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii) acquisition of 20% or more of the voting power
of the Company or 20% or more of the equity interests or general partner interests in the Company
Operating Partnership (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, such
interests), (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity security of the Company or the Company
Operating Partnership, (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, spin-off, joint venture or similar transaction involving the
Company or the Company Operating Partnership pursuant to which any Person or group (or the
equityholders of any Person) would acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on the fair market value thereof, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized committee
thereof) or to which 20% or more of the Company’s net revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis
are attributable or 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company or the Company
Operating Partnership or of the surviving entity in a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other
business combination involving the Company or the Company Operating Partnership or the resulting
direct or indirect parent of the Company or the Company Operating Partnership or such surviving entity
or (v) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any

made by a third party on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly authorized
committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment and after consultation with the Company’s
outside legal counsel and financial advisors (i) would, if consummated, be more favorable to the
Company’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger Transactions (including after
giving effect to any adjustment to the terms thereof proposed in writing by Parent) and (ii) is reasonably
capable of being completed in accordance with its terms, taking into account (A) all legal, regulatory,
financial, financing, and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal (including, the sources of and terms
of financing, market conditions, the form of consideration, and the timing of and conditions to closing)
and (B) the likelihood and timing of consummation; provided that for purposes of the definition of
“Superior Proposal”, the references to “20%” in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to
be references to “50%”.
(i) As used in this Agreement, “Intervening Event” means any material event, change, effect, condition,
development, fact or circumstance with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
that occurred or arose after the date of this Agreement, which (i) was neither known by, nor reasonably
foreseeable (with respect to magnitude or material consequences) by the Board of Directors of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) first becomes known to or by the Board of Directors
of the Company prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; provided that none of the
foregoing shall constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries meeting or
exceeding any internal or public projection, budget, forecast, estimate or prediction in respect of
revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (it being understood that the
underlying facts or occurrences may be considered an Intervening Event to the extent otherwise
satisfying the terms of this definition), (B) any change in and of itself in the market price, credit rating or
trading volume of shares of Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ or any change affecting the

cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary,

applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law become applicable to any of
the Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully
minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.
(c) Each of the parties hereto shall (x) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions (which shall request the early termination of
any waiting period applicable to the Transactions under the HSR Act) as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event within 10 Business Days following
the date hereof and (y) make, or cause to be made, all appropriate filings required with respect to the
Other Regulatory Approvals as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto further shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by the Federal Trade
A-40 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Commission (the “FTC”), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) or any other

impediment and secure expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods and obtain all
approvals under any Antitrust Laws and obtain all Other Regulatory Approvals that may be required by
any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each case with competent

reasonably practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly take all actions necessary
and advisable to secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law, obtain the Other Regulatory Approvals and resolve any objections
asserted with respect to the Transactions under the Federal Trade Commission Act or any other
applicable Law raised by any Governmental Authority, in order to prevent the entry of, or to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any Restraint that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the Transactions, including (i) (A) executing settlements, undertakings, consent
decrees, stipulations, public law contracts or other agreements with any Governmental Authority or with
any other Person, (B) selling, divesting or otherwise conveying or holding separate particular assets or
categories of assets or businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (C) agreeing to sell, divest or

or their respective Subsidiaries, (F) terminating any joint venture or other arrangement, (G) creating any
relationship, contractual right or obligation of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or

Subsidiaries (and, in each case, entering into agreements or stipulating to the entry of any Judgment by,
or filing appropriate applications with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority in
connection with any of the foregoing and, in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company, by
consenting to such action by the Company (including any consents required under this Agreement with
respect to such action); provided that any such action shall be conditioned upon the Closing); and (ii)
defending through litigation any claim asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by any
Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any Restraint that would prevent the Closing prior to the Outside Date. Parent shall respond
to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any objection asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, no party hereto shall be required to take or commit to take any of the
actions listed in clause (i) of this Section 5.03(c) with respect to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to the extent that such actions would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any
party to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing. Parent shall (x) control the
strategy for obtaining any approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders

Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry or litigation by or before, or any
negotiations with, a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions and of all other regulatory
matters incidental thereto; provided that Parent shall consider the Company’s views in good faith.
(d) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, including any “employee benefit plan”  (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any
vacation, paid time-off and severance plans, but excluding any plans providing for defined benefit
pension or post-termination or retiree health or welfare benefits), for all purposes, including determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, each
Continuing Employee’s service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service
with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent and for the same purpose as such service was
credited under the analogous Company Benefit Plan; provided, however, that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.
(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.09(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare
benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent
that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible and co-
payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate
from and after the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.
(e) Subject to Section 5.09(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, if the Effective Time occurs prior to the
date on which the Company pays annual bonuses for the performance year in which the Closing occurs,
then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay a bonus to each Continuing Employee who is
otherwise eligible to receive an annual bonus for the performance year in which the Closing occurs (the
“Closing Year Bonus”); provided that the Closing Year Bonus payments shall be (i) based on the bonus
plan and targets in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) determined reasonably and in
good faith by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) paid by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation at the same time that such annual bonuses are typically paid in the
ordinary course of business.
(f) Prior to making any broad-based communication or written communications (including website
postings) pertaining to employment, compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the
intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, which comments the Company shall consider in good faith.
(g) The provisions of this Section 5.09 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no
provision of this Section 5.09 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of, or an
amendment to, any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, and, except as otherwise
explicitly provided for in this Agreement, no current or former employee, director, natural person service
provider or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, have the right to enforce the provisions hereof or have any other rights
or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, under this Agreement or any rights or
remedies under any Company Benefit Plan that such Person would not otherwise have under the terms
of that Company Benefit Plan. Nothing in this Section 5.09 shall be construed to: (i) limit or prohibit the
ability of Parent or its Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) from modifying, amending or terminating any benefit or compensation plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement, (ii) require Parent or any of its Affiliates (including following the

$813,500,000 in cash (the “Parent Termination Fee”) by wire transfer of same-day funds simultaneously
with such termination so long as the Company has provided Parent with wire instructions for such
payment, it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay or cause to be paid the
Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion or in addition to any other remedy or damage.
(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.03 are an
integral part of the Transactions, and that without these agreements, the other parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties further acknowledge and agree that the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee by the Parent or the Company, as applicable,
pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall not constitute a penalty, but will be liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company and Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable, for any losses, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses or
obligations, including the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculation with
precision. If the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay or cause to be paid any
amount due pursuant to this Section 7.03, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, commences an Action which results in a final and nonappealable judgment against
the other party, with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, or parties, with respect to the Company, for the
payment set forth in this Section 7.03, such paying party shall pay or cause to be paid to the other party
or parties, as applicable, its or their reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) in connection with such Action, together with interest on
such amount at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received.

(g) Payment of Parent Termination Fee.
(i) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.03(b) (the “Parent Termination Fee Amount”), Parent shall pay to the Company from the
applicable Parent Termination Fee Amount deposited into escrow, if any, in accordance with the
next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the Parent Termination Fee Amount and (B) the
sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company without causing the Company to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment
of such amount did not constitute income described in Section 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code
(“Qualifying Income”), as determined by the Company’s independent certified public accountants,
plus (2) in the event the Company receives either (X) a letter from the Company’s counsel
indicating that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 7.03(g)(ii)(B) or
(Y) an opinion from the Company’s outside counsel as described in Section 7.03(g)(ii)(B), an
amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee Amount less the amount payable under clause (1)
above. To secure Parent’s obligation to pay these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an
amount in cash equal to the Parent Termination Fee Amount with an escrow agent selected by the
Company and on such terms (subject to Section 7.03(g)(ii)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company, Parent and the escrow agent as reflected in an escrow agreement among such parties;
provided that the payment or deposit into escrow shall be at the Company’s option. The payment
or deposit into escrow of the Parent Termination Fee Amount pursuant to this Section 7.03(g)(i)
shall be made at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Company such amount pursuant to Section
7.03(d) by wire transfer of same-day funds.
(ii) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Parent Termination Fee Amount in escrow or any
portion thereof shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent receives any one or
combination of the following: (A) a letter from the Company’s independent certified public
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company
without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code in such year determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income or a subsequent letter from the Company’s accountants revising that amount, in which case
the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (B) a letter from the Company’s
counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the
Company of the Parent Termination Fee Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
(or alternatively, the Company’s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by the Company of the Parent Termination Fee Amount would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Parent Termination Fee
Amount to the Company. Parent agrees to amend this Section 7.03(g) at the reasonable request of
the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Parent Termination Fee Amount that may be
distributed to the Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Company’s chances of
securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 7.03(g)(ii) or (z) assist the Company in
obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 7.03(g)(ii).
Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.03(g) so long as
it deposits into escrow the Parent Termination Fee, notwithstanding any delay or reduction in
payment to the Company, and shall have no further liability with respect to payment of the Parent
Termination Fee. The portion of Parent Termination Fee Amount that remains unpaid as of the end
of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during subsequent taxable years, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this Section 7.03(g); provided, however, that any amount that has not been
released from the escrow to the Company pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.03(g) as of
the fifth anniversary of the deposit into such escrow shall at that time be released to Parent, and
Parent shall have no further obligations to the Company with respect thereto.

relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement and the
Transactions, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Subject to the express terms of this
Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 8.07(b) without proof
of damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and
(b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right neither the
Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly
agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies
in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the
Merger Consideration and Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing (but not the right of
the Company to seek such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other
reason) shall only be available in the event each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) the
Marketing Period has ended, (B) all conditions in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 were satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) at the time when the
Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to Section 1.02, (C) the Debt Financing (or, if alternative
financing is being used in accordance with Section 5.04, such alternative financing) has been funded in
accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice
delivered to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or, if
alternative financing is being used in accordance with Section 5.04, such alternative financing) are funded,
then the Company stands ready, willing and able to then consummate the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement on such date and (E) for the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement has not been terminated. The
parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement that is available pursuant to the
terms of this Section 8.08 is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise
have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.08 shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party
hereto brings any Action, in each case, in accordance with this Section 8.08, to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party or the Company brings any action
seeking an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the Equity Funding
Letters, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (x) for the period during which such Action is
pending, plus twenty Business Days or (y) by such other time period established by the court presiding over
